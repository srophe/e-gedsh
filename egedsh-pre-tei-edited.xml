<div type="entry"><head>Aba I</head>
 (d. 552) 
<label type="affiliation">Church of the East</label><anchor/>
<div type="body">
<p>Teacher of biblical interpretation, author, Cath. (540–52). Born from Zoroastrian parents, Aba converted to Christianity and studied at the<ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>. He traveled to the Roman Empire and visited<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (where he was taught Greek, probably by his later disciple<ref type="cr">Toma of Edessa</ref>), Palestine, Egypt, and Constantinople. Upon his return, he became a teacher of biblical interpretation (<i>mpaššqānā</i>) at the<ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> and subsequently at the School of<ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, which he is said to have founded. Following the death of Cath. Pawlos, he was elected as his successor in 540. In 544 an itinerant synod was held, during which Aba, accompanied by a changing number of bishops, visited several dioceses, many of which still suffered from the division in the church that had existed prior to the short tenure of Cath. Pawlos. The<ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref> has preserved the following documents, which are related to this ecclesiastical visitation and, more broadly, to Aba’s reforms: 1. on reform of church governance; 2. on the orthodox faith; 3. on the<i>politeia</i> of correct behavior (focusing on Christian marriage and rejecting various kinds of illicit unions); 4. on the deposal of the initiators of division and schism; 5. on the various degrees in the ecclesiastical hierarchy; 6. a letter entitled<i>Practica</i> (fragments); 7. canons (1–40; incomplete). Aba came into conflict with the Persian authorities and spent several of his years as Cath. in prison and in exile.</p>
<p>The sources attribute to Aba several commentaries on OT and NT books, of which only fragments exist in later works, such as the commentaries of<ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>. During his travels, around 530, he served as the instructor in biblical matters to the Egyptian author Cosmas Indicopleustes, who ca.  550 wrote his ‘Christian Topography’. Cosmas (in Book II.2) acknowledges Aba, whom he calls Patrikios (derived from the Greek word for ‘father’), as his source and is aware of Aba’s later election as Cath. in Persia. Interested in the Greek originals of<ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>’s and<ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>’s works, Aba may have gathered around him a team of translators. One of these may have been the Syriac translator of Nestorius’s ‘Book of Heraclides’, who dedicated his work to Aba. A comment in the Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref> led Baumstark to suggest that Aba may have authored a Syriac translation of the Greek OT, but this cannot be substantiated.</p>
<p>In addition to a number of Syriac and Arabic sources providing details of Aba’s life, there is an important Syriac Life (published by Bedjan), which presents itself as the work of one of Aba’s disciples. Two of Aba’s other disciples,<ref type="cr">Qiyore of Edessa</ref> and Toma of Edessa (who died in Constantinople around 543), are known through their own writings.</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Aba II of Kashkar</head>
<LemmaComment>(641–751) 
<label type="affiliation">Church of the East</label><anchor/>
</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Scholar, Bp. of Kashkar, and Cath. (741–751). Born in (the vicinity of) Kashkar in 641 as son of Brik Ṣebyaneh (‘Blessed be His Will’). He received his education in the School of<ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> and was for a certain time Bp. of Kashkar before his election as Cath. in 741. In the sixth year of his Catholicate a conflict between Aba and the clergy of Seleucia-Ctesiphon arose; the latter accused the Cath. of having illegally taken the possessions of the city’s School. According to a letter written by Aba to the director, the teachers, and the other ‘brothers’ of the School, these charges were brought against him while he stayed outside the patriarchal seat for some time (probably for reasons of health). According to some medieval sources the Cath. retired in a monastery of al-Wāsiṭ for a year, but returned to Seleucia-Ctesiphon after the conflict was settled. Aba is known as the author of different works which, except for ‘the Letter to the leaders of the School’, are lost: the Book of the Governors (<i>Ktābā d-esṭraṭige</i>), a Commentary on the Theologian (<ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>), a Commentary on some works concerning dialectics (probably some books of the ‘Organon’ of<ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>), a Homily on the Martyr Zakhe, and Exegetical Homilies (<i>Memre puššāqāye</i>). From the latter many fragments and extracts have been preserved i<LemmaComment>n the</LemmaComment><CrossReferenceBold>Gannat Bussāme</CrossReferenceBold><LemmaComment>, containing the exegesis of passages</LemmaComment> from Gen., Num., Isa., and the four Gospels. These fragments and extracts are of great importance for the cultural and intellectual history of the Ch. of E. for at least three reasons: 1.  they represent the genre of exegetical prose homilies in a style which shows a strong influence from and a very sophisticated use of Greek rhetoric; 2. they show a very dynamic and varied exegetical tradition, in which not only influences from the works of<ref type="cr">Theo­dore of Mopsuestia</ref> but also from the works of<ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref> and from the ancient tradition of the<ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref> become noticeable; 3. they present interesting early examples of apologetic and polemic dispute in response to Islamic criticism of Christian tenets such as the Trinity and the Divinity of Christ. Although Aba is reported to have maintained as Cath. good relations with the Muslim governor of Iraq, Yūsuf b. ʿUmar al-Thaqafī, his homilies testify that he took a fierce polemical stand against the anti-Christian proclamations that the Arab authorities propagated in his days.</p>

<div type="body">
<p>Disciple of<ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, author, and biblical commentator. The ‘Testament of Ephrem’ mentions Aba as the first of Ephrem’s seven disciples. He must, therefore, be the same person as ‘Mar Aba, the disciple of Ephrem’ to whom several fragments are attributed in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,194, a 9th-cent. W.-Syr. collection of extracts from exegetical and theological works. These fragments, published by Nau, are taken from a Commentary on the Gospel (3 fragments), a Psalm Commentary (one fragment), and a<i>memrā</i> on Job the (OT) athlete (one fragment). To these meager remains some new texts may perhaps be added.</p>
<p>Aba is explicitly quoted in a work on the Holy Chrism by<ref type="cr">Anṭun of Tagrit</ref>, which exists in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,726 (f. 72r–85r) and remains unpublished.</p>
<p>In 1975, Beck published a long extract (240 lines of 7 syllables each) from a poem attributed to ‘Mar Aba, the disciple of the holy Mar Ephrem’ from ms. Sin. Syr. 67 (9th cent.). It deals with God’s immeasurable power and mercy.</p>
<p>In 1980, Reinink drew attention to forty fragments preserved in the<CrossReferenceBold>Gannat Bussāme</CrossReferenceBold> and quoted under Ephrem’s name. While other fragments bearing Ephrem’s name in the same work can be located in Ephrem’s Commentary on the<ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref>, these forty fragments do not belong to that work. Similarities with the previously identified Aba fragments suggest Aba’s authorship. These unpublished fragments show the author’s familiarity with the Diatessaron, even though he also knew the four separate Gospels.</p>
<p>More recently, among the<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> mss. a long ascetic text has come to light under the title ‘<i>Memrā</i> on faith’ (<i>haymānutā</i>). In two marginal notes the work is identified as ‘Book of the mind’ (<i>Ktābā d-reʿyānā</i>) and is explicitly attributed to ‘Mar Aba, the disciple of Mar Ephrem’. Possible connections come to mind with a<i>Ktābā d-reʿyāne</i> (plur.), translated by W.  Wright as ‘Book of sentences’, which is attributed to Ephrem and extracts of which exist in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,167, f. 293v. It cannot be ruled out that we are dealing here with an example of the entanglement between the literary heritage of the master and the disciple. If that is the case, future research hopefully will be able to delineate the disciple’s contribution and to bring him out of his master’s shadow.</p>

<LemmaComment>(fl. first quarter of 9th cent.) 
<label type="affiliation">Church of the East</label><anchor/>
</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Logician, theologian, legal scholar, translator, and metropolitan, first of<ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>, and later of<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> and Ḥazza. The name ‘Bahrīz’ reveals his Persian descent. Ḥabīb was probably his given name and ʿAbdishoʿ his ecclesiastical name. Most of our information about ʿAbdishoʿ derives from Muslim sources, most importantly from Ibn al-Nadīm, who mentions that he translated many works of logic and philosophy, and that he wrote commentaries on classical works for the Abbasid Caliph al-Maʾmūn (d. 833), and made summaries of<ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>’s ‘Categories’ and ‘On Interpretation’. Ibn al-Nadīm also makes reference to his works in defense of ‘Nestorian’ Christology, among which is a response to two works by a Syr. Orth., in which ʿAbdishoʿ refuted the Syr. Orth. and Melk. ­belief in the ‘oneness of hypostasis’ (in Christ), and hence showed that ‘his wisdom was close to the wisdom of Islam’. In an anonymous report of a brief Christological discussion between ‘ʿAbdishoʿ, the Nestorian Muṭrān,<ref type="cr">Abū Qurra</ref>, the Melkite Bishop, and Abū Rāʾiṭa, the Jacobite’ before a Muslim vizier (ed. with ET by Toenies Keating), the name of the ‘Nestorian’ has been taken by most modern scholars as a reference to Cath.<ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (823–28), but it is more likely that this name points to ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz, who was also a contemporary of these interlocutors. ʿAbdishoʿ’s apologetic work entitled<i>Maqāla fī al-tawḥīd wa-al-tathlīth</i>, ‘Treatise on the Unity and Trinity (of God)’ possibly still survives in mss. in Syria that have remained inaccessible so far (see Swanson). Of two works that have been published, one is in Syriac and one in Arabic. The former is his legal handbook on marriage and inheritance law (ed. Selb), the latter a treatise on logic based on Aristotle’s ‘Categories’ and<ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Isagoge’ (ed. Dānishpazhūh). This work on logic,<i>Kitāb ḥudūd al-manṭiq</i>, was commissioned by Caliph al-Maʾmūn. ʿAbdishoʿ’s connection with the Abbasid elite is further evidenced by the fact that he translated Nicomachus’s ‘Introduction to Arithmetic’ from Syriac into Arabic, for the Abbasid general Ṭāhir b. al-Ḥusayn (see Freudenthal and Lévy). He also translated works for his friend<ref type="cr">Gabriel bar Bokhtisho</ref>ʿ, presumably in the field of medicine.</p>

<p>Bp. and scholar. ʿAbdishoʿ was bp. of Sinjar and<ref type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>, before becoming metropolitan bp. of<ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> (Ṣoba) and Armenia (ca. 1291). He wrote in Syriac and in Arabic. Although in many ways his writings crowned the achievements of a highly productive era in E.-Syr. scholarship, many of them do not survive, e.g. a commentary on OT and NT, along with other works treating doctrine, canon law, philosophy, and science. His surviving works include:<i>Margānitā</i> ‘The Pearl’, an influential systematic explanation of E.-Syr. theology; the<i>Nomocanon</i>, a compilation of synodal decrees containing the most complete collection of E.-Syr. canon law, still authoritative in the Ch. of E.; a ‘Treatise on the Rule of Ecclesiastical Judgements’, for use as an ecclesiastical court manual; and a collection of theological poetry entitled ‘Paradise of Eden’ (also known as the<i>Maqāmāt</i>). His metrical ‘Catalogue of Books’ is an invaluable repository of information about the authors and works of the Syriac literary heritage, including many that are no longer extant. Published with a Latin translation by J.-S. Assemani in Rome in 1725, the ‘Catalogue’ helped clarify for western scholarship the breadth and basic contours of Syriac literature, providing stimulus and some direction for the nascent study of Syriac literary history in the West.</p>

<p>ʿAbdishoʿ bar Yoḥannan d-Beth Maron, monk of the monastery of Mar Aḥa the Egyptian, in the region of Gazarta (Cizre), participated in the Synod which deposed Patr. Shemʿon VII bar Mama (1552) and elected<ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref> as Patr. Cath. Recognized by the Pope, Yoḥannan ordained ʿAbdishoʿ Metr. of Gazarta. After Yoḥannan Sullaqa’s violent death in 1555, ʿAbdishoʿ succeeded him as Patr. of the newly established E.-Syr. Uniate (Chaldean) Church. He mainly resided in the Monastery of Yaʿqob the Recluse near<ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>.</p>
<p>He wrote three Syriac panegyrics of unequal length on his predecessor. The first describes the alleged debaucheries of Patr. Shemʿon VII bar Mama, the election of Yoḥannan Sullaqa, his journey to Rome and his profession of faith submitted to the Pope, his consecration as archbishop and Patr. and his return to the Middle East. The work ends with an original description of the churches of Rome. The second poem describes the assassination of Yoḥannan Sullaqa at the instigation of Shemʿon  VII. The third is a funeral<i>madrāšā</i>. He composed in Syriac a profession of faith, destined to the Roman authorities (original lost, preserved in different Latin redactions and a retroversion into Syriac), an acrostic<i>turgāmā</i> in honor of Pope Paul IV, several liturgical pieces, a grammatical poem, and a<i>memrā</i> on the soul.</p>

<p>Bp. of<ref type="cr">Jersualem</ref> (1872–4) and Patr. (1906–15). Born in Ṣadad of deacon Jirjis b. ʿAbdullāh Saṭṭūf and Nasra b. Ḥanna al-Tawīl. He joined<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> in 1857, and later taught at<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> for six years where he was consecrated a deacon. In 1866, he became the secretary of Patr. Yaʿqub II in<ref type="cr">Amid</ref> who, on 19 Feb. 1867, tonsured him, then ordained him to the priesthood after two weeks. In 1870, he toured the area of<ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> and recorded the names of villages, monasteries, churches, clergy, and the families living in the area (ed. Bcheiry). He was consecrated bp. of Jerusalem on 3 Sept. 1872 by Patr. Peṭros IV and was named Gregorius. ʿAbdullāh accompanied the Patr. to England and India from 1874 to 1877. After the return of the Patr. from India, ʿAbdullāh stayed for two more years before going back to London where he secured a printing press for Dayr al-Zaʿfarān. After his return, ʿAbdullāh served as the bp. of Syria from 1880 to 1886.</p>
<p>ʿAbdullāh paid a second visit to London, during which he attended sessions of the 1888 Lambeth Conference, and secured a second printing press. In 1890 he became the bp. of Amid. In 1895 or 1896, the Armenians persuaded ʿAbdullāh to sign a petition which, according to Shahīn, ‘went against the wishes of the Ottoman government’. The government issued an order for his exile, but ʿAbdullāh took refuge with the French consul where he joined the<ref type="cr">Syriac Catholic Church</ref>. In the Syriac Catholic Synod of 1898 in<ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, ʿAbdullāh was appointed Syriac Catholic bp. of<ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref> and Ḥama, and on 9  Oct. 1898 he participated in the election of Patr.<ref type="cr">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref>, and accompanied him in 1902 to Rome, France, and Constantinople. After the deposition of the Syr. Orth. Patr.<ref type="cr">ʿAbdulmasīḥ  II</ref> on 10 Nov. 1903, ʿAbdullāh was elected and then consecrated Syr. Orth. Patr. on 5 Aug. 1906. Shortly after, he visited London for the third time<i>en route</i> to India in 1908–12. In London, he met King Edward VII twice. In India, he established the Knaʿanaya diocese. After his return from India in 1912, he stayed at the<ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Mark</ref> until his death in 1915 and was buried there. ʿAbdullāh received a medal from King Edward VII, and two Ottoman medals from the Ottoman sultan. In 1910 he reopened the seminary at Dayr al-Zaʿfarān. He established al-Ḥikma Magazine in 1913. That same year he established for the first time a council that consisted of six clergy and six laymen. The council held its first session from 20 Feb. until 17 March 1914 but was short lived due to World War I.</p>

</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Abgar is named as the author of the martyrdom of Hormizd and his nine companions from<ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>, who died at the end of Yazdgard’s reign (r.  399–420). P. Devos has convincingly shown that three other martyrologies — the martyrdom of Narsai of Beth Raziqaye, of Ṭaṭaq of<ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref>, and of Yaʿqub the Notary  — must also have been written by Abgar. These four martyr texts are grouped together in ms. Berlin, Or. oct. 1257 and share similar content and style. The execution of all these martyrs took place at Sleq Ḥarobta, not far from<ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, and in the proximity of a monastery to which in all likelihood Abgar belonged. The ‘cycle of Abgar’, as Devos has named it, must have been composed between 421 and 424 (prior to the synod of<ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref> and covers the very last years of Yazdgard I’s and the beginning of Vahram V Gor’s (r. 420–38) reigns. Abgar must have been a direct witness to many of these events, and he describes them in a sober style.</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Abgarids of Edessa</head>
<anchor/>
<div type="body">
<p>Dynasty of kings who ruled in<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> from ca. 133 BC until the middle of the 3rd cent. The most common names in this line of kings are Abgar and Maʿnu, both of which are of a North Arabian type. The disintegration of the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd cent. BC allowed the Abgarids to establish their power. With the appearance of the Romans in the Near East in the 1st cent. BC, the Abgarids were able to maintain Edessa and the surrounding area of Osrhoene as a more or less independent buffer state between the Roman and the Parthian empires. Our main source for the list of ca. 30 Edessene kings is the late 8th-cent.<ref type="cr"> Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>. Additional information is occasionally provided by other sources, Syriac and non-Syriac, as well as by coins. Of particular interest is the E.-Syr. Chronicle of<ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (d. 1046).</p>
<p>Our knowledge of the earliest history is very limited. It becomes more substantial from the moment when Rome began to extend its reach into Mesopotamia, i.e., from Abgar VII (109–116) on through the end of the dynasty. In the 2nd and early 3rd cent. the relationship between Rome and Edessa intensified; it reached its climax under Abgar VIII, the Great (177–212). Rome finally imposed its power on Edessa when in 212/13 the short-lived reign of Abgar VIII’s successor was ended and the city declared a Roman colonia. The dynasty was briefly restored in 239, but by 242 Rome had once again taken full control. Whether this was the definitive end or whether the dynasty in one form or another continued to exist for some years, as<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> seems to suggest in his Chronicle, is unclear.</p>
<p>It is under the Abgarid kings that the distinctive<ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> language form that later became known as ‘Syriac’ first started being used in<ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref>. The<ref type="cr">script</ref> of the inscriptions is closely related to the<i>Esṭrangela</i> of the earliest, 5th-cent. Syriac mss. (even though some of the mosaic inscriptions exhibit a slightly more cursive type). Mosaics, numismatic evidence, and a number of inscriptions, mostly funerary, provide glimpses into Edessa’s social and cultural life. In addition to its Aramaic background, these also reveal the impact of Roman as well as of Parthian culture. Several of the preserved mosaics can be dated to the reign of Abgar VIII or to the period when Edessa was under Roman rule.</p>
<p>The two kings most closely associated with Syriac Christianity are Abgar V Ukkama (‘the Black’, 4  BC–AD 7 and 13–50) and Abgar VIII. The former was alleged to have corresponded with Jesus and, at the arrival of the apostle Addai, to have converted to Christianity, along with most of the city. This legend is first mentioned in<ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History (early 4th cent.) and is further developed in the early 5th-cent.<ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref>. Some scholars have suggested that the historical kernel relates to Abgar VIII and was retrojected into the reign of Abgar V. However, the few indications that Abgar VIII might have been a Christian each pose their problems. First, the addition in the Book of the Laws of Countries, by<ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>’s pupil Philippus (ca. 200), that Abgar VIII outlawed the practice of self-castration ‘when he came to faith’ (<i>kad haymen</i>) may very well be a later interpolation, as it is lacking from the quotation of the relevant passage in Eusebius of Caesarea’s ‘<i>Preparation for the Gospel</i>’ (VI,10,44). Second, even though Sextus Julius Africanus describes Abgar VIII as a ‘holy man’ (as quoted from the ‘Kestoi’ in George Synkellos’s ‘<i>Chronography’</i>), this does not necessarily point to the Christian religion. As a matter of fact, the various renderings of this term include not only<i>hieros</i>‘holy’ (<i>Synkellos</i>),<i>sanctus</i>‘holy’ (Jerome’s Latin translation of Eusebius’s Chronicle), and<i>kāhnāyā</i> ‘priestly’ (Yaʿqub of Edessa), but also terms that do not take on a religious connotation, such as<i>šappirā</i> ‘excellent’ (Chronicle to the year 724) and<i>azniw</i> ‘noble’ (Armenian version of Eusebius’s Chronicle). Also noteworthy is the fact that the coins and the mosaic portrait of Abgar VIII (published by Drijvers) do not reveal any Christian symbols or ideology. It is very unlikely, therefore, that Abgar VIII — or any other king of the Abgar dynasty — ever converted to Christianity. Christianity, however, did exist in Edessa under Abgar  VIII. According to Sextus Julius Africanus, the Christian author Bardaiṣan was an intimate of the royal court. In addition, a brief comment (seen by some as a later addition) in the account of the flood of Edessa in the year 201, as preserved in the 6th-cent.<ref type="cr">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, reports that the ‘sanctuary of the church of the Christians’ (<i>hayklā d-ʿedtā da-kresṭyāne</i>) had suffered damage.</p>
<p>If none of the Edessene kings ever was Christian, it is all the more interesting that the Abgarid dynasty, decades after its disappearance, had a Christian afterlife and became an important element in the self-definition of Syriac Christians.</p>

<p>Nicknamed ‘the Lame of Beth Ṣayyade’ after the village in<ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref> where he was born, he was the disciple of the reformer of ecclesiastical music Babai of Gbilta and later became teacher at the School of Bashosh in Persia, founded by Babai, and the School of Marga. At the end of his life, he established himself at the<ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref> near<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, known as the Upper Monastery. According to<ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>, he was the author of a Book of admonition, a Commentary of Marcus Eremita, a Disputation with the Jews, a work on the Royal Path, some<i>memre</i> on penitence and different letters. Of the latter, only his Letter to a certain Yoḥannan, who had decided to embrace the monastic life, is preserved. It is followed by some spiritual admonitions (<i>zuhhāre</i>). His importance for Syriac lexicography is acknowledged by<ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>, who mentions him in the introduction to his Syriac-Arabic lexicon. According to<ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>, a certain Abraham, who may have been Abraham bar Dashandad, was also active as a copyist of works of<ref type="cr">John Chryso­stom</ref> (including one of his writings to the fallen Theodore<i></i>[<i>CPG</i> 4305] and the Letters to Olympias [<i>CPG</i> 4405]) and<ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. Following Krüger, the fragments of the commentary on<ref type="cr">Mark the Monk</ref>, preserved in ms. Brit. Libr. Syr. Add. 17270, which according to the<i>Catalogue</i> of W. Wright (<i>Catalogue … British Museum</i>, vol. 2, 482) may have been written by Abraham bar Dashandad, are rather to be attributed to<ref type="cr">Babai the Great</ref>.

<p>Teacher of biblical interpretation and director of the<ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>. Our main sources for Abraham’s life are the two works attributed to<ref type="cr">Barḥadbshabba</ref> and the Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref>. The second part of Abraham’s name, ‘from the house of our master’ (<i>d-Beth Rabban</i>), is generally understood to refer to<ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>, the first director of the School of Nisibis, who may have been Abraham’s relative. Barḥadbshabba the historian presents Abraham as Narsai’s immediate successor and in charge of the school for 20 years (502/3 – ca. 522). According to Barḥadbeshabba, Abra­ham was then temporarily replaced by<ref type="cr">Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye</ref> but he returned to his office a few years later and held it until his death, probably in 569. Other sources present Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye as Narsai’s immediate successor and put the beginning of Abraham’s tenure ca. 510. For some time during his directorship Abraham may have been assisted by his relative<ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Beth Rabban</ref>. During Abraham’s directorship the School flourished and had its greatest expansion, despite Abraham often being the target of attacks both from within and from outside the E.-Syr. community.</p>
<p>Barḥadbshabba the historian credits Abraham with building activities in the School, including a hospice (<i>xenodochion</i>) for the sick and cells and baths for the students. As an instructor in biblical interpretation he may have played an important role in the transmission of the commentaries of<ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia.</ref>Barḥadbshabba reports that ‘he edited and explained’ (<i>ktab w-paššeq</i>) Theodore’s commentaries, because they were too difficult for the students. In this process he is said to have followed ‘the tradition that he had received from his teacher’ (i.e. Narsai). Unfortunately, none of Abraham’s works have survived. He is, however, often quoted in later E.-Syr. commentaries on several OT books.</p>

</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Monk, founder and abbot of the ‘Great Monastery’ on Mount Izla. Several biographical accounts of Abraham’s life have been preserved, but since their primary goal was to establish Abraham’s authority as monastic reformer, their historical information should be used with caution.</p>
<p>Abraham was from the region of Kashkar (later al-Wāsiṭ, in present-day southern Iraq). After a period of preaching in<ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref>, he is said to have traveled to the Egyptian desert of Scetis, to Mount Sinai, and to<ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>. He then spent some time at the<ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>, where he studied with<ref type="cr">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref> and with<ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Beth Rabban</ref>, before settling, around the middle of the 6th cent., on Mount Izla, in the vicinity of<ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>. He built the ‘Great Monastery’ and assembled many disciples. A  monastic rule, consisting of twelve canons, was issued in 570. In the following decades, Abraham’s disciples founded monasteries all over Mesopotamia and Persia. Many of the great ascetics of the Ch. of E. are associated with Abraham’s monastic movement.</p>
<p><LemmaComment>Monastic life on Mount Iz</LemmaComment>la was of the Egyptian type and consisted of a combination of solitary and coenobitic lifestyles. Whether it was modeled on monasticism in Scetis as Abraham personally experienced it during his travels, or whether Abraham’s alleged Egyptian ‘pilgrimage’ served to legitimate the reform, remains an open question. It also is debated whether E.-Syr. Christianity was exposed to Egyptian asceticism only in Abraham’s day or whether this already had happened much earlier, perhaps under Mar<ref type="cr">Awgen</ref>, the 4th-cent. Egyptian ascetic who was said to have come to Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Although asceticism and monasticism must have existed in the Ch. of E. long before Abraham, they had been marginalized by the synods of the late 5th  cent. Abraham succeeded in bringing them back to the center of the church, where they developed under the control of the ecclesiastical and theological authorities. Abraham is said to have introduced a distinct tonsure and dress for the monks of his new movement, thus distinguishing them from Syr. Orth. monks as well as from dissenters within the Ch. of E. who, continuing perhaps some of the earlier patterns of asceticism, were often branded as ‘Messalians’.</p>

<p>Monastic author. Very little is known about the life of Abraham. ‘Nathpar’ (in some sources, ‘Nephtar’, or ‘Nephrath’) appears to be the same as modern Guwair, southeast of<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> in Iraq, and may designate either Abraham’s birthplace or the site of his monastery. Abraham flourished during the period of monastic revival sweeping the Ch. of E. due to the reforms of<ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref> at Mount Izla. The ‘Catalogue’ of<ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>credits Abraham with having written ‘various compositions’, mainly on the spiritual life, some of which were translated into Persian. A study of them suggests that Abraham tended to adapt older ascetic materials (e.g.<ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>) rather than compose his own. Some of the works ascribed to him actually derive from other authors (e.g.<ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref> and<ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>). In the mid-7th cent., Sabrishoʿ Rustam, while head of the monastery of Beth Qoqa, wrote a biography of Abraham, which has not survived (Assemani,<i>BibOr</i>, vol. 3.1, 454–5).</p>

<div type="body">
<p>Syriac writing containing the legendary correspondence between Jesus and King Abgar of<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, the report of the apostle Addai’s mission to Edessa and of the city’s christianization, and the story of the finding of the Cross by Protonike, the wife of emperor Claudius. Towards the end, the text claims to have been written by Labubna, the king’s scribe, and to have been deposited in the royal archives at Edessa.</p>
<p>An earlier and shorter version of part of this story exists in the first book (I,13) of the Greek Ecclesiastical History of<ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref> (written in the late 3rd and early 4th cent.), who mentions a Syriac document from the archives of Edessa as his source. In Eusebius’s text Addai is known by the name Thaddaios (Thaddeus), and some of the details of the later story, such as the portrait of Jesus, are missing. Eusebius’s account ends after Abgar is healed and Thaddaios is asked to speak to the people of Edessa, a prelude to the city’s conversion. The Ecclesiastical History was translated into Syriac around 400. The exact relationship between Eusebius’s text and the early 5th-cent.<i>Teaching</i> remains somewhat unclear, and several expansions of the<i>Teaching</i> obviously belong to the 4th and 5th cent.</p>
<p>Eusebius’s claim of a written source appears plausible, which implies that the kernel of the story was composed, at the latest, towards the end of the 3rd cent. What is remarkable, however, is the paucity of outside corroboration for this story. In the approximately 100 years between Eusebius’s work and the Teaching, no mention is made of this story in Syriac sources. The complete silence of<ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, who spent the last ten years of his life in Edessa, as well as of the<ref type="cr">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, a mid-6th-cent. composition that includes important information on 4th-cent. Edessa, is particularly striking. The earliest affirmation of the story is by Egeria, who mentions it in her Latin travelogue (383–84). It is only after the<i>Teaching</i>begins to circulate that Syriac sources begin to reference the story.</p>
<p>The origins of the story are difficult to discern. The most plausible theory takes into account the heterogeneous nature of the earliest Christianity in Edessa. In the 2nd and 3rd cent. Edessa was home to many competing groups, as the followers of<ref type="cr">Marcion</ref>,<ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>,<ref type="cr">Mani</ref>, a ‘proto-orthodox’ group, and others all vied for authority. The story most likely originated inside one of these groups fighting for both supremacy and authenticity. Whatever is the case, the group that later became dominant and represented orthodox Christianity perpetuated the story in order to substantiate its claim as the true faith.</p>
<p>The story’s popularity reveals its importance for later Syriac Christianity. Accordingly, Syriac Christianity could trace its roots all the way back to the apostles and to Jesus himself. Also significant is the connection that the story establishes between Edessa,<ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, and Rome, thus linking the nascent Edessene church to Christianity in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>An interesting subplot surrounds the portrait of Christ in the<i>Teaching</i>. While this portrait does not occur in Eusebius, and is only briefly mentioned in the<i>Teaching</i> as a portrait painted by Ḥannan, the tabularius, it later became famous in Byzantine Christianity. From the late 6th cent. onwards, the portrait was said to have been ‘made not by human hands’. In 944, the portrait was taken to Constantinople and became an icon of great importance. There is no trace of it after the sack of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204.</p>
<p>The full Syriac text of the Teaching is preserved in one early ms., which was written probably in Edessa around 500 (nowadays in the library of St. Petersburg), while extracts exist in a few other mss. In the 5th cent., the Syriac text was translated into Armenian; in the ensuing centuries the legend became fully part of Armenian historiography. There are also translations into Arabic. From Arabic it found its way into Ethiopic, where it enjoyed great popularity.</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Adiabene<anchor/>
</head>
<div type="body">
<p>Classical Adiabene, Syriac<i>Ḥadyāb</i>, refers to the region between the Upper and Lower Zab rivers, from the Tigris in the west to Mt. Ṣalāḥ al-dīn (= Mt. Pirmum) in the east. Its main city was the ancient Assyrian Arbaʾil (modern Arbīl), seat of Ishtar of<ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>, goddess of war and collaborator in the creation of humans. Ḥazzā, the name referring to Adiabene in Arabic sources, was an earlier center of the region, located some 12 km. southeast of Arbīl. The impressive citadel of Arbela contains remains from the Neolithic period to modern times, including Sasanian, Christian, and Islamic levels in between. Arbaʾil was a caravan city on a trade route linking southern Mesopotamia and Persia with Palestine and Egypt, as shown in an Aramaic letter signed by Arshama, the Achaemenid satrap of Egypt (late 5th cent. BC). During the 1st cent. AD the local royal family converted to Judaism, under Izates, who enjoyed quite a remarkable reign according to<ref type="cr">Josephus</ref> (‘Antiquities’,<i></i>20.17–94). Christianity spread into this region quite quickly, with Papa possibly serving as its first metropolitan as of 310. The Synod of 410 held in<ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> declared Adiabene a metropolitan seat, occupied in that year by Daniel. Thereafter, Adiabene grew into a great administrative province of the Ch. of E., though it suffered several persecutions, especially under Shapur  II (309–379). The jurisdiction of the metropolitan of Adiabene was not restricted to his own province but extended at one point to include Azerbaijan and<ref type="cr">Nineveh</ref>, divided into nine suffragan dioceses. When<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> grew in political and economic importance at the beginning of the 9th cent., it separated from Adiabene, but the latter continued to be a Metropolitan see until the beginning of the 17th cent. By the end of the 18th cent. most of Adiabene joined the Catholic uniate movement, and Arbela fell under the jurisdiction of the Chaldean archbishop of Kirkuk.</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Aḥiqar</head>
<anchor/>
<div type="body">
<p>Aḥiqar, ‘the Aramean Sage’ who is mentioned in an Akkadian text, is the hero of a narrative set in the Assyrian Court: as the Minister of Sennacherib (705–681 BC) and Esarhaddon (680–69 BC), he instructs his nephew Nadan by means of wise sayings, so that in due course he might succeed him; Nadan, however, is impatient and plots to have the Assyrian king put Aḥiqar to death, but a friend hides the Sage and only reveals that he is still alive when the Assyrian king is put to a challenge by the Egyptian Pharaoh. Aḥiqar is produced and solves the riddling challenge; he then proceeds to give Nadan a second set of instructions, this time admonitory in character.</p>
<p>A collection of sayings by Aḥiqar, and a narrative concerning him, is already known in Imperial<ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> in fragmentary form from a papyrus from Elephantine (south Egypt) dated to the 5th cent. BC (the recent identification of the erased under-text as a customs document concerning shipping cargos, dated 475 BC, provides a<i>terminus post quem</i>); here the king is Esarhaddon. Very probably the sayings and the narrative once circulated independently in slightly different dialects, but in their combined form they have proved very influential over the course of time in many different languages, and they have continued to be read up to the present day. In the Hellenistic period Aḥiqar is mentioned by name in the book of Tobit (1:21–2; 2:10; 11:19; 14:10, 15), and traces of the work have been found in Egyptian Demotic. It must also have been translated into Greek, since ‘Akikharos’ is mentioned by several Greek authors, and much of the narrative has been reused in the Greek Life of<ref type="cr">Aesop</ref> (probably 1st cent.); furthermore, a lost Greek translation must lie behind the subsequent translations into Old Slavonic and Romanian.</p>
<p>Five recensions of the Syriac form of the Story are preserved, and these evidently go back to a lost older Syriac text which will have been the basis for the Armenian version (which in turn was the source for the Georgian and Old Turkish translations), and for the Arabic adaptations (sometimes under the name of Luqman). The Ethiopic translation derives from Arabic, and the Modern Syriac versions, though based on Classical Syriac, also show some influence from Arabic forms of the Story.</p>

<LemmaComment>(late 6th cent.?) 
<label type="affiliation">Church of the East</label></LemmaComment><anchor/>
<div type="body">
<p>Exegete from<ref type="cr">Beth Qaṭraye</ref> mentioned by<ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>. According to Assemani he lived around 990. Cowley suggests identifying this Aḥob with Ayyub, ‘the interpreter of Seleucia’, who lived at the end of the 6th cent. His main argument is that<ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> (9th  cent.) has quoted Aḥob. In all likelihood Christianity had already disappeared from the Beth Qaṭraye region by the beginning of the 10th  cent.; therefore, it would indeed seem wise not to date him much later than other important scholars from Beth Qaṭraye such as<ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>,<ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref>, and<ref type="cr">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref>. Assuming that Cowley is right, Aḥob was born in Qaṭar and must have migrated to<ref type="cr">Seleucia</ref>. The Chronicle of<ref type="cr">Siirt</ref> states that he was considered for election as Cath. in 581, when<ref type="cr">Isho</ref>ʿ<ref type="cr">yahb</ref> was chosen.</p>
<p>ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha’s ‘Catalogue’ credits Aḥob with an ‘Elucidation of the whole New (Testament), of the Pentateuch and all the Prophets, in addition to (or: except for) an elucidation of the Beth Mawtbe (i.e. Josh., Judges, 1–2 Sam., 1–2 Kings, Ruth, and wisdom books)’. These works have not been handed down to us: the New Testament commentary Baumstark suggested to attribute to Aḥob is lost (ms. Siirt 27). We do have quotations in later authors, however.</p>
<p>The Genesis part of the Anonymous Commentary on the Pentateuch (9th/10th cent.) contains two references to Aḥob, according to some of the manuscripts. Especially important are the quotations in the Commentary on Psalms ascribed to<ref type="cr">Denḥa</ref> (9th  cent.?), partly in the margins and partly in the text itself. Some of these present the exegesis of<ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. The parallels between Aḥob and Ishoʿdad of Merv can be explained by assuming that Ishoʿdad used Aḥob, but not the other way round. Aḥob was an important source for Ishoʿdad’s alternative readings of the biblical text, especially the readings attributed to ‘the Hebrew’. The 19th-cent. mss. (ms. Mingana Syr. 58 and ms. Cambridge Or. 1318, among others) containing the Denḥa commentary also include a Book on the cause of the Psalms of Mar Aḥob Qaṭraya. Mingana and Vosté’s attribution to him of yet another treatise, a classification of the Psalms, is probably incorrect, however.</p>
<p>Fragments of Aḥob were also quoted by<ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043) in his biblical commentaries in Arabic, whence they found their way to Ethiopia, where they were first translated into Ethiopic and later received a place in the Amharic Andemta commentary tradition. Further references to Aḥob can be found in<ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>’s Lexicon and in<ref type="cr">Isḥaq Shbadnaya</ref>’s prose commentary on his own Poem on the Divine Government of the World from the Creation to the Consummation (15th cent.).</p>

The ms. of 1904 continues with a short anonymous text on man as a microcosm, which could be by Aḥudemmeh (so Gignoux, who also considers the previous text to be by the 6th-cent. Aḥudemmeh; he also draws some parallels with Middle Persian sources, and to similar material in<ref type="cr">Shemʿon d-Ṭaybutheh</ref> and in<ref type="cr">Gewargis Warda</ref>’s poem on Man as a Microcosm, ed.

<p>Bp. of<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (324/5–345/6). A short work in Armenian is transmitted under his name and the editor described it as being addressed ‘to the Christians in the region of Persia, on Faith’. Although it has been claimed (by de Durand) that the original was Greek (and the work is listed in<i>CPG</i> 3340), it is almost certainly a translation from Syriac. The theological phraseology makes it very unlikely that the work really belongs to the first half of the 4th cent. (thus Bruns), and it would best fit sometime between 410 and 428 (thus Bundy).</p>

<p>Italian humanist, belonging to the earliest generation of Syriac scholars. He became Doctor of Canon and Civil Law in Pavia, his native city. After receiving the Holy Orders and joining the<i>Canons Regular of Saint Augustine, Albonesi went to Rome, where Cardinal Bernardino López Carvajal, on behalf of Pope Leo X, commissioned him to examine the Syriac version of the Maronite missal. Thus Albonesi made the acquaintance of the three delegates of the Maronite patriarch to the Fifth Lateran Council (1512–17): the priest Joseph Kūri (Acurius), the deacon Moses, and the subdeacon Elias bar Abraham (from whose hand came the first Syriac mss. to enter the Vatican Library). At that time Albonesi knew no Syriac, but he had studied Hebrew in Rome with some Jewish scholars, among whom were Joseph Zarfati, Abraham of Balmes, and a certain</i>ʿ<i>Abdias (perhaps</i>ʿO<i>badiah Sforno, Reuchlin’s teacher). Zarfati, who, like the Lebanese envoys, spoke Arabic, served as an interpreter, allowing the translation of the Syriac missal into Latin via Arabic and Italian (the product of this enterprise is found in codex Estensis</i>α.R.7.20 in Modena).<i> Albonesi returned to his hometown with the knowledge of Syriac that he had gained by studying under Elias’s guidance and with a ms. of the Syriac Psalter that he intended to publish. Both the ms. and the types he had produced were, however, destroyed during the sack of Pavia on the part of the French army of François I (1527). The unexpected finding of his lost ms. among the wrapping paper of a sausage-maker in Ferrara reportedly prompted Albonesi to rebuild his typography and to devote himself to the preparation of that which he meant to be an introduction to the edition of the Syriac Psalter. The book, entitled Introductio in Chaldaicam linguam, Syriacam atque Armenicam, &amp; decem alias linguas…</i> (‘Introduction to Chaldean, Syriac, Armenian, and ten other languages…’, Pavia, 1539), was finally printed by<i> Giovanni Maria Simonetta. The previous year Guillaume Postel had already xylographically reproduced, in his Duodecim characteribus differentium alphabetum…</i>(Paris, 1538), two brief Syriac texts. Albonesi’s<i>Introductio</i>, however, despite some graphic inaccuracies, presented for the first time in Europe a substantial amount of information about the Syriac language, as well as Syriac texts of some length. Albonesi was also instrumental in igniting Johann<i>Albrecht Widmanstetter’s interest in Syriac. Widmanstetter, whom</i>Albonesi<i>met in Reggio Emilia in 1529, would eventually publish, along with</i><ref type="cr">Mushe of Mardin</ref><i>, the first edition of the NT Peshitta (Vienna, 1555).</i></p>

<div type="body">
<p>City in northern Syria and an important center of Christianity in the Middle East today as the seat of a total of nine bishoprics (Syr. Orth., Syr. Catholic, Chald., Maron., Melk. Orth., Melk. Catholic, Armenian Orth., Armenian Catholic, Latin). Aleppo, nicknamed ‘Grey Aleppo’ (<i>Ḥalab al-šahbāʾ</i>) in Arabic, owes its military and commercial importance to its imposing citadel and its favorable position on the trade route linking the nearby Mediterranean coast with Mesopotamia and areas beyond. Aleppo’s history goes back at least to the second millenium BC. The earliest known names of Aleppo are cognates of the modern name ‘Ḥalab’, but Seleucus Nicator (d.  281  BC) who founded a Greek colony here named it after ‘Beroea’ in Macedonia, and it is by that name that Aleppo is normally known in older Syriac literature. Aleppo came under Roman rule in 64 BC. After the Arab conquest in 636, Aleppo first rose to prominence under the Ḥamdānid Sayf al-Dawla (945–67). Aleppo later became the seat of lines of Zangids (1129–83) and Ayyūbids (1183–1260). Aleppo was taken by the Mongols in 1260 and a little later by the Mamlukes. Under the Ottomans (1516–1918), Aleppo became the capital of a province covering much of today’s northern Syria and a significant part of Turkey (including<ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, Alexandretta/Iskenderun, and ʿAintab/Gaziantep). For much of that period, it was the third largest city in the Ottoman Empire after Istanbul and Cairo, and the Christians, including Syr. Christians, as well as a larger number of Melkites and later an increasing number of Armenians, then played an important role in the life of the city, one noteworthy member of the Aleppine Syr. Catholic community from the period being the world-famous chess player Philip Stamma (ca. 1705–55). Aleppo is today the largest city in Syria with a population of ca. 1.7 million (2.85 million in the larger conurbation, in 2008).</p>
<p>The first known bp. of Aleppo is Eustathius, who became Patr. of Antioch and attended the Council of Nicaea in that capacity. Bp. Peter of Aleppo was a supporter of<ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> at the Synod of Sidon in 511, while Bp. Antoninus was among the Miaphysite bishops exiled with<ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> under Emperor Justin.</p>
<p>The first known Syr. Orth. bp. after the reorganization of the church in the mid-6th cent. is Matthew (644–669). Among his successors was<ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (ca. 1253–64), who was the bp. there when the city fell to the Mongols in 1260. Little is known about the Syr. Orth. community in the subsequent period until the beginning of the 16th cent., when we first hear of a Syr. Orth. (later Syr. Catholic) church of the Mother of God in the Christian quarter of Judayda (Jdeideh), and we find Aleppo included, along with<ref type="cr">Damascus</ref> and Ḥama, in the title of Metr.<ref type="cr">Grigorios Yawseph the Iberian</ref> of<ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> (metr. 1515–37). From the second half of the 16th cent. onwards, we frequently hear of visits to Aleppo by Syr. Orth. patriarchs, including Ignatius Pilatus I (Patr. 1591–97) who died and was buried in Aleppo. The Syr. Orth. community in Aleppo, reduced to a small number through large-scale conversions to the Syr. Catholic Church since the latter half of the 18th cent., was reinforced in the 20th cent. by refugees fleeing the atrocities in areas now in the Republic of Turkey. These refugees included a group from<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, who migrated to Aleppo en masse in 1924, as well as those from the area around<ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>.</p>
<p>As a center of Latin missionary activity since the beginning of the Ottoman era, with Capuchins, Jesuits and Carmelites present in the city by 1526, Aleppo played an important role in the formation of the<ref type="cr">Syriac Catholic Church</ref>. Andrew Akhījān (Patr. 1662–78) worked and was elected Patr. in Aleppo, while Michael Jarweh (Patr. 1782–1800) was born in Aleppo and was Metr. of Aleppo prior to his elevation to the patriarchate. The central role Aleppo continued to play in the life of the Syr. Cath. Church is reflected in the fact that five out of the thirteen successors of Michael Jarweh have been natives of Aleppo (Michael Ḍāhir, Peter Jarweh, George Chelhot, Antony Ḥayek, Peter ʿAbd al-Aḥad), while two others were Metr. of Aleppo before ascending to the patriarchate (<ref type="cr">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref>,<ref type="cr">Gabriel Tappuni</ref>).</p>
<p>The E.-Syr. see of Aleppo is attested in the 11th cent. and is also mentioned as a suffragan of Damascus in a list of bishoprics appended, in a 13th-cent. ms., to the canonical works of Elias of Damascus (ca. 900), but it was probably extinct by the 13th cent. Nothing is then heard of the E.-Syr. presence in Aleppo until the 17th cent. The Chald. diocese of Aleppo, founded as a patriarchal vicariate in 1901 and raised to the status of an eparchy in 1957, today covers the whole of Syria.</p>
<p>The presence of an early Maronite community in Aleppo in 727 is recorded in the Chronicle of<ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>. Significant presence of Maronites in the modern period dates from the 17th cent., with Maronite bishops regularly resident in the city since 1686. Aleppo played an important role in the life of the Maronite Church as one of her few urban centers, and the Maronite school there produced such men as the three founders of the Maronite Aleppine Order (later Mariamites) and the scholar-bishop Germanus Farḥāt (bp. of Aleppo 1725–32). The Maronite woman mystic Hindiyya al-ʿUjaymī was born in Aleppo in 1720.</p>
<p>In the first decade of the 20th cent., there were reported to be approximately 35,000–40,000 Christians in the city, making up about one third of the total population and including: 3,500 Syr. Catholics (4,000 in the diocese), 50 Syr. Orth. (500 in the diocese), 250 Chald. and 3,600 Maron. (Karalevsky); as well as 1,200 Melk. Orth., 10,000 Melk. Catholics, 15,000 Armenian Orth., 5,500–7,000 Armenian Catholics, 1,100 Latins and 1,500 Protestants (Tournebize). The numbers reported today for the Syriac dioceses of Aleppo are: Syr. Orth. 15,000 (in 2003, Zinda Magazine); Syr. Catholic 8,000 (in 2006,<i>Annuario pontificio</i>); Chald. 15,000 (in 2006,<i>Annuario pontificio</i>, for whole of Syria); Maron. 4,000 (in 2006,<i>Annuario pontificio</i>). The actual numbers (esp. for the Chaldeans) will have been increased significantly by those fleeing insecurity in Iraq since 2003.</p>
<p>Little is known about the sites of the medieval Syriac churches in Aleppo. The churches dating from the Ottoman period are found in the traditional Christian quarter in Judayda just north of the medieval city. These include the Melkite and Armenian churches concentrated in the Ṣalībat al-Judayda Quarter, as well as the Syr. Catholic Church of Mār Āsyā al-Ḥakīm (formerly Mother of God) a little to the east, and the Maronite Cathedral of Mar Eliya to the north. A  number of newer churches, including the Syr. Catholic Cathedral (Umm al-Intiqāl/Assumption, 1970), are found in the ʿAzīziyya District to the north of Judayda. The Chaldean Cathedral and the Syr. Orth. Cathedral of Mar Ephrem lie further north in Sulaymāniyya. Further churches belonging to the Syriac communities are found in the ‘Old Syriac Quarter’ (Ḥayy al-Suryān al-Qadīm) just behind the railway station to the northwest of the city center, a quarter established by migrants from Edessa (Mār Jirjis, Syr. Orth.; Mār Afrām, Syr. Catholic), and in the ‘New Syriac Quarter’ (Ḥayy al-Suryān al-Jadīd) further northwest (Sayyidat al-Suryān ‘Our Lady of the Syriacs’, Syr. Orth.).</p>
<p>Important collections of Christian Arabic and Syriac mss. are found in Aleppo at the Maron. Archiepiscopal Residence (over 1640 mss.), Fondation Georges et Mathilde Salem (most of Sbath Collection, no. 777–1321, and some additional mss.), Syr. Catholic Archiepiscopal Residence (ca. 500 mss.) and Syr. Orth. Archiepiscopal Residence and Church of Mar Jirjis (including the collection transferred from Edessa, ca. 225 mss.), as well as at the Melk. Catholic Archiepiscopal Residence (ca. 1,100 mss.).</p>
<p>A large number of ruined Byzantine churches are found in the so-called ‘Dead Cities’ in the hills to the west of Aleppo, including the ruins of the huge basilica built around<ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>’s pillar at Qalʿāt Simʿān (approx. 30 km. west-northwest of Aleppo).</p>

<div type="body">
<p>The exploits of Alexander the Great (356–23 BC) gave rise to a very large number of works, in many different languages. The three main works concerning him in Syriac are:</p>
<p>1. A translation of Pseudo-Callisthenes, (based on the Greek recension<i>delta</i>), preserved in a number of late E.-Syr. mss. (ed. with ET by Budge). According to Nöldeke, this was not translated directly from Greek, but by way of a lost Middle Persian version; this view has, however, been recently challenged by Ciancaglini, who points to strong evidence that it was made directly from Greek. The Syriac version includes a visit by Alexander to<ref type="cr">China</ref>, which is an episode absent from all other texts. There is also a Modern Syriac version.</p>
<p>2. A narrative poem on Alexander attributed to<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, but dating almost certainly from soon after the emperor Heraclius’s victory over the Persians (629/30). The different recensions are edited by Reinink (ET in Budge, 163–200).</p>
<p>3. A christianized legend of Alexander entitled ‘The exploits of Alexander’. This is found in the mss. of the Syriac version of Pseudo-Callisthenes (and is included in Budge’s edition) and, in a somewhat different, but related, form, in the<ref type="cr">Zuqnin Chronicle</ref>. This too is thought to date from shortly after 629/30. According to van Bladel (2008), this provided the source for the section on Alexander in the Qurʾān.</p>
<p>Other Syriac texts relating to Alexander are:</p>
<p>4. A short life, preserved in a single ms. of the 8th/9th cent. (ET in Budge, 159–61).</p>
<p>5. Sayings attributed to Alexander, preserved in various sources, including<ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s Amusing Stories.</p>
<p>6. A set of short laments over Alexander, said to have been uttered by various philosophers. These are also found in Arabic, in the Annals of Eutychius (ca. 935).</p>
<p>7. An account of Alexander’s encounter with the Brahmin Dandamis (an excerpt from<ref type="cr">Palladius</ref>’s ‘On the Peoples of India and on the Brahmins’).</p>
<p>8. Various notices in Chronicles.</p>
<p>9. Ms. Vat. Syr. 555 (W.-Syr., dated 1501) contains an astronomical ‘Book of Alexander’.</p>

<p>Town 40 km. north of<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> in Iraq. Seat of a Chald. bishopric. It now numbers around 5,000 inhabitants. Many families and individuals migrated from Alqosh to larger Iraqi cities (Mosul,<ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>, etc.) or abroad, especially to the USA and UK. The town’s economy is based on agriculture (wheat, barley, chickpeas, lentils, beans, cucumbers, gourds, melons, grapes, and figs) and animal husbandry (sheep and goats). Traditional trades included weaving and dying cloth. Alqosh is a major spiritual center. Jews used to go on pilgrimage to the tomb believed to be that of the prophet Nahum, who, according to an interpretation of Nah 1.1, may have come from Alqosh. Two important E.-Syr. monasteries lie close to Alqosh: the<ref type="cr">Monastery of Rabban Hormizd</ref>, founded in the 7th   cent., used to be one of the patriarchal residences of the Ch. of E., later moved to Mosul, then Baghdad, and the more recent Monastery of the Virgin, also known as ‘the Lower Monastery’ or ‘of Our Lady of the Seeds’. From the 16th cent. the cultural life of the village flourished thanks to the so-called<ref type="cr">School of Alqosh</ref>. Alqosh was pillaged several times, by Murād Bey (Bar Yak) in 1508, the Pasha of ʿAmadiyya in 1740, the Persians in 1743. People sought refuge on the mountain, in the Monastery of Rabban Hormizd, but there were rapes and casualties. Around the mid-16th cent. some of the population supported<ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref>, the first Chald. Patr. elected with official approval of Rome. In 1767, around 100 of the 500 families were Catholic. Literary sources and annotations made by European travelers record recurrent cases of pestilence and famine, caused by draught or locusts, which devastated the region during the 19th cent. In 1832 and 1842 the village was attacked and pillaged by Kurds.</p>

<p>City in upper Mesopotamia. Situated on high ground on the right bank of the Tigris and surrounded by massive black basalt walls, which later gave it the nickname ‘Black (<i>kara</i>) Amid’, Amid was by the 4th cent. a key point in Rome’s defence of her eastern frontiers and became the most important city in the Roman province of Mesopotamia after the cession of<ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> to the Persians in 363. It was taken by the Persians in 359, 503, and 606/7. After the Arab conquest in 639, it was ruled by a series of dynasties including the Kurdish Marwānids (984–1085), and the Turkmen Īnālids (1097–1183), Ḥisn Kayfā Artuqids (1183–1230) and Aq Qoyunlu (1401–1507), dynasties which at one point or another made Amid their chief seat. After being taken by the Ottomans in 1515, Amid became the administrative center of a province that covered most of northern Mesopotamia from Manzikert in the north to Sinjar in the south. It is today a provincial capital and the largest city in the Turkish part of Mesopotamia with a population of over half a million. The name Diyarbakır (Arabic<i>Diyār Bakr</i>), which originally referred to the region around Amid, came to be used for the city in Ottoman times and was officially adopted in 1937, replacing the older name which goes back to Assyrian ‘Amedi’.</p>
<p>Amid was evangelised at an early date, no doubt from<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. The first known bp. of Amid, Simeon, is said in a late source to have attended the Council of<ref type="cr">Nicaea</ref>. His successors include Acacius, celebrated for his ransoming of Roman soldiers taken captive by the Persians in 423/4, as well as Asterios and Shemʿon, the only bishops from the province of Mesopotamia to attend the councils, respectively, of Ephesus and Chalcedon. The area around Amid was an important center of monasticism with five monasteries within the city by 525 (<ref type="cr">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>, Ecclesiastical History, VIII.5). Well-known monasteries in the immediate vicinity include those of 1. the Edessenes (4th cent., probably on a site just south of the city wall); 2. Yoḥannan Urṭaya (4th cent., north of the city wall), where<ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> spent his youth; and 3. Zuqnin, the home of the<ref type="cr">Zuqnin Chronicle</ref>. Of importance at a later date was the Monastery of Prophet Elijah near the village of Qanqart, ca. 8 km. southwest of Amid (attested 11th–19th cent.).</p>
<p>In the period after the Council of Chalcedon, Amid was a Miaphysite stronghold, and Bp. Mara of Amid was one of those bps. expelled from their sees under Emperor Justin I. After a period of persecution for the Miaphysites under the Chalcedonian Bp. Abraham bar Kaili, a line of Miaphysite bishops was reestablished with the consecration of Eunomius in ca. 546. Among the later occupants of the see was<ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>. Amid has been the seat of the Syr. Orth. patriarchs on several occasions, including a period in the 11th cent. after Dionysios IV (1032–42) took refuge in the then Marwānid city to escape persecution in Byzantine<ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>, during the tenure of Ignatius<ref type="cr">ʿAbdullāh I bar Sṭephanos</ref> (1521–1557), and in 1862–71 when Ignatius Yaʿqub II (1847–1871) took up residence in the Yoldat Aloho Church in the wake of disturbances in<ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>. The Syr. Orth. see of Amid lapsed with the demise of Metr. Dionysios ʿAbd al-Nūr Aslan in 1933.</p>
<p>The presence of E.-Syr. Christians in Amid is suggested by the inclusion of ‘Amid’ in the titles of bishops of Maypherqaṭ from the 12th cent. onwards. The first Chald. patriarch,<ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref>, resided in Amid after his return from Rome in 1553. Later, Amid became the residence of a new line of Chald. patriarchs from Yawsep I (1681–96) to Yawsep V (Augustin Hindi, 1781–1828). The Chald. see of Diyarbakır, vacant after 1923, was revived in name in 1966, with residence, however, in Istanbul and jurisdiction over the whole of Turkey (vacant since 2005 as of going to press).</p>
<p>Syriac Christians originally constituted the majority of the Christian population, but came to be outnumbered by the Armenians under Ottoman rule. The Melkite community, which had been Syriac-speaking in pre-Islamic times, dwindled after the Arab conquest, but was reinforced by migrants from<ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> in the 17th cent. According to a census conducted in 1870, the city had a population of 21,372, with 9,814 Muslims, 6,853 Armenian Orth., 831 Armenian Catholics, 1,434 Syr. Orth., 174 Syr. Catholics, 976 Chald., 305 Melk. Orth., 55 Melk. Catholics, 650 Protestants and 280 Jews. In 1908,<ref type="cr">Naʿʿūm Fāʾiq</ref> published there the first number of his journal<i>Kawkbo d-madnḥo</i>. In 1914, the Syriac population of the city is reported to have stood at 8,000, and that of the thirty or so nearby villages (including Kaʿbiya, Sharukhiya, Qarabash, Quṭurbul, ʿAyn Tannūr/Ali Pınar) at 6,450. Though greatly diminished by the massacres during the First World War, a sizeable Christian community remained until relatively recently, with the Syr. Orth. community still numbering nearly 1,000 individuals in the early 1960’s. In 2005, the city had one resident Syr. Orth. priest and 7 Syr. Orth., 2 Chald., and 2 Armenian families.</p>
<p>Of the older churches in the city, two, both of them former patriarchal residences, remain in regular use: 1. Yoldat Aloho (Syr. Orth., in Lāle Bey Quarter, in the southwest section of the old city, 3rd/6th cent.?), with the main church of Yoldat Aloho and that of Mor Yaʿqub adjoining it to the north and housing the relics of<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>; 2. Mar Petion (Chald., in Özdemir Quarter, east of main crossroads). (An Evangelical church opened opposite Yoldat Aloho in 2003). Still in situ are: St. George’s (in the citadel, 4th cent.?), Latin (Capuchin, in northeast section of old city, 17th cent.), Protestant (southeast) and Armenian Catholic (southeast) churches, as well as the Armenian Orth. churches of Surp Giragos (adjoining Mar Petion to the east, 16th cent.) and Surp Sarkis (southwest, 16th cent.) and chapel of Surp Hagop. Two churches were demolished in the 20th cent.: 1. Cosmas and Damian (east of Yoldat Aloho, 4th cent.?, Melk. in modern period); 2. the Syr. Cath. Church (northeast, 7th cent.?). Among the churches mentioned in historical records, the one built by Emperor Heraclius in 628/9 was probably a Syr. Orth. Church, which is to be distinguished from the Melk. church (called St. Thomas?) occupying the site of the present Great Mosque (see Palmer). Other known churches (some of them possibly identical with those already mentioned) include: St. John the Baptist (place of burial, in 649/50, of Bp. Yuḥanon of the Arabs), St. Stephen (converted to fire temple in 503), Mor Zʿuro (near Urfa Gate, before 503; burial place, in 649/50, of Patr.<ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of the Sedre</ref>and Shemʿun of Edessa), Mor Shilo (built by Bp. Mara ca. 520), St. Theodore (northeast, Armenian in 16th cent.) and Mor Ḥananyo (southeast?). Kırklar Dağı ‘Hill of the Forty’, to the south of the city, is probably the site of the Church of the Forty Martyrs built by Yuḥanon Soʿuro of Qarṭmin (bp. of Amid 483/4–502), who was responsible also for the construction of the nearby Tigris bridge.</p>

</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Patr. of the Maronites, author of a Syriac grammar. Born in Ehden, Lebanon, ʿAmīra was sent to Rome in 1583, to study at the newly founded Maronite College (1584). Upon his return to Lebanon he was ordained priest, immediately followed by his consecration as bp., in 1596. In 1634 he was elected patr. Belonging to the first generation of Maronite ecclesiastical leaders trained in Rome, he was instrumental in bringing the Maronite Church further in line with the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>His significance for Syriac studies lies in the fact that he is the author of a Syr. grammar, which he wrote during his stay in Rome and which was published in 1596:<i>Grammatica syriaca, sive chaldaica</i>. After<ref type="cr">Andreas Masius</ref>’s publications, which were the first to provide systematic descriptions of the Syriac language in Europe (1571), and which served as models for some later scholars, ʿAmīra produced an entirely independent grammar, which in comparison with Masius’s work was based on a larger corpus of texts, paid more attention to the indigenous Syr. tradition, and included more discussion of syntactical problems (Contini). A partial French translation by J. F. de la Croix was made in 1681 (apparently unpublished). With the exception of some translations from Latin into Syriac for the Maronite Missal (published in Rome between 1592 and 1594), ʿAmīra did not publish any other Syriac work. His Arabic publications are all related to his pastoral and church-administrative work as bp. and patr.</p>

<div type="body">
<p>The town of Amyūn is situated 20 km. south of Tripoli<ref type="cr"></ref>(Northern Lebanon), on the road between Chekka and Kousba, built on a high, rocky cliff rising above the plains of olives and fruit orchards watered by the Qadisha river. This citadel has a long history. Early neolithic burial graves are still visible in the rock walls towering over the lower town, and fragments of classical carving are built into the walls of the houses along narrow, medieval streets. During the period of the<ref type="cr">Crusades</ref>, the town belonged to the Seigneury of Besmedin, a branch of the Seigneury of Giblet (Jbeil or Byblos). Several medieval churches still function in the town.</p>
<p>The Church of Mar Phocas, which is nowadays Greek Orthodox, has a simple barrel-vaulted nave, a deeply recessed apse and two side-aisles, separated by heavy stone piers with pointed arches. Like many of the medieval Lebanese churches, it was built over the foundations of a classical temple. Only a few fragments of fresco decoration survive, and these are mostly from different periods and differing styles indicating different hands.</p>
<p>In the apse are the scant remains of an Anastasis painting. Parts of Christ’s flying cloak are visible as he pulls Adam out of the grave. Behind Adam is Eve, and behind her is Abel. On the other side are David and Solomon, and the remains of a scroll once held by John the Baptist. Above the head of Christ is a little flying angel.</p>
<p>Below the apse, in the lower zone, are eight apostles on either side of Sts. Peter and Paul. Most of these saints are too damaged to be identified.</p>
<p>On the northern wall, near the apse, is a large portrait of St. Philip, with the small figure of a donor at his side, also called Philip. On the same wall, toward the west, are the remains of<ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref> between two standing saints and two flying angels. The large piers of the church are decorated on all four sides with remains of paint, showing several saints, a portrait of St. Simeon the Younger Thaumaturgos, a portrait of the standing St. Phocas, Christ Pantocrator, and an equestrian St. Theodore spearing a dragon.</p>
<p>These wall paintings are all inscribed in Greek. Some attempt has been made to write in Syriac over a long inscription in the lower zone of the apse, with the unfortunate result that neither the original Greek, nor the later Syriac is legible. Stylistically, the apse painting and the tall portrait of St. Philip closely resemble contemporary wall paintings in 12th-cent. Cyprus. The wall paintings on the piers show at least two layers of paint, and whereas the bottom layer is most likely 12th cent., the top layers belong to the 13th.</p>

<div type="body">
<p>Large Sasanian city on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, the ruins are near present-day Falluja, ca. 60  km. west of<ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>. Shapur I (241–72) fortified, or rebuilt, a pre-Sasanian town, the official name became Peruz Shapur ‘Victorious Shapur’, commemorating his victory over the Roman Emperor Gordian  III in 243. Some sources, however, connect the city with Shapur  II (310–79) and his victory over the Roman Emperor Julian in 363. The city’s popular name ‘Ambāra’ (Arab.<i>al-Anbār</i>) means ‘magazine; storehouse’, and refers to its strategic function as an arsenal of victuals and weapons for the fortified places along the western frontier. The earliest reliable information comes from the historians Ammianus Marcellinus (XXIV 2,9–22; d. ca. 395) and Zosimus (III 17,3–18,6; ca. 500). Ammianus saw the city (<i>Piri-sabora</i>) with his own eyes during the campaign of Emperor Julian. He describes it as large and populated, with a citadel and a double wall. Zosimus reports that the city (<i>Bērsabōra</i>) was second in rank after the Sasanian capital Ctesiphon. During the first centuries of Islam, al-Anbār remained prosperous, being the residence of the Abassid Caliphs al-Saffāḥ (750–54) and al-Manṣūr (754–75) until the latter moved to the new capital Baghdad (762). The city declined until the end of the first millennium; in 1262 it was sacked by the Mongols.</p>
<p>Al-Anbār was a see of the Ch. of E., first mentioned in the 5th cent. The main sources (surveyed by J.-M. Fiey) are the<ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref> and the ‘Book of the Tower’ (<i>Kitāb al-majdal</i>, ed. H. Gismondi). Several bps. are known, the last known was consecrated in 1111. Three of them bacame Cath.: Ṣliba Zka (713–28), Theodosios (853–58), and Yoḥannan bar Narsai (884–91).<ref type="cr">Eliya of al-Anbār</ref> was elected Patr. in 937, but failed to receive the Caliph’s approval. There were two monasteries in al-Anbār: St. Quryaqos and the famous one of Mar Yonan. The Jewish community in al-Anbār (probably identical with Pumbedita) was founded in the 4th cent. It was one of the largest in Babylonia (the sources are surveyed by A. Oppenheimer). A second Peruz Shapur is on the eastern bank of the Tigris near the Khabur inflow.<i></p>

<p>City in the historical region of Syria (today in Turkey). Titular see of Syr. Orth., Syr. Catholic, Maron., Melk. Orth., Melk. Catholic (united with Alexandria and Jerusalem) and, until 1953, Latin patriarchs. Antioch is situated at the foot of Mt. Silpius in the valley of the Orontes, approximately 25 km. from the Mediterranean coast. Founded by Seleucus I Nicator ca. 300 BC and named after his father Antiochus, Antioch grew rapidly as the capital of the Seleucids. For the Romans who took it in 64 BC it was their largest and most prosperous city in Asia. Antioch was taken by the Sasanians for the first time in 256, when Shapur I deported many of its citizens and settled them in, among other places, the city he named ‘Better is the Antioch of Shapur’, the later Gondeshapur (<ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>). After its destruction by Khusrau I in 540, the city was rebuilt on a smaller scale by Justinian, only to be attacked again by the Persians at the beginning of the 7th cent. and occupied by them for over a decade from 611. Antioch was captured by the Arabs in 637/8. Under the Byzantines again in 969–1084, it was taken by the Crusaders in 1098. The Frankish Principality of Antioch lasted until 1268, when it was conquered by the Mamluks. A minor provincial town under the Ottomans and the French mandate, Antioch became the capital of the short-lived Republic of Hatay in 1938 before being incorporated, together with the rest of the former district (sancak) of Alexandretta, into the Republic of Turkey in 1939.</p>
<p>The Apostle St. Peter and St.<ref type="cr">Ignatius of Antioch</ref> are reckoned as the first and third bishops of Antioch, and it is after them that it later became customary for the Maron. patriarchs to adopt the name ‘Peter’ and the Syr. Orth. and Syr. Catholic patriarchs the name ‘Ignatius’. The city in which St. Paul preached and the followers of Jesus were first called ‘Christian’ soon became the most important center of Christianity in Asia, and its see was recognised as ranking alongside those of Rome and Alexandria at the Council of Nicaea. The area under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Antioch that later became known as ‘patriarchate’ largely coincided with the civil diocese of the ‘East’ (Oriens) — whence the title ‘of Antioch and All the East’ still born by the patriarchs  — corresponding roughly to the parts of today’s Turkey south of the Taurus, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Holy Land, the last of which later formed a separate Patriarchate of<ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>(although this was recognized only by the Chalcedonian churches). The theological school at Antioch which flourished in the 4th and 5th  cent. was to have a major influence on the theology of the Ch. of E. through the writings of<ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> and others. Antioch was one of the major battlegrounds in the Christological controversies of the 5th and 6th cent. that led to the formation of the Syriac Churches as separate entities from the Imperial Church. Among the patriarchs of Antioch resident in Antioch, John I (428–42) was a supporter of<ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>, while Peter the Fuller (468–86, with interruptions) and<ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> (512–18, d. 538) were important proponents of the Miaphysite teaching.</p>
<p>Since the expulsion of Severus by Emperor Justin the Syr. Orth. patriarchs have usually been unable to reside in, or even visit, their titular see, except on such occasions as when Caliph Yazīd II allowed Eliya  I (709–24) to make a solemn entry into the city and consecrate a new church there in 721, and during the Crusader period, when the Frankish rulers and Latin clergy of the city tended to favor the non-Chalcedonian Christians as their allies against Muslims and Melkites. From that period we know of a forced sojourn in Antioch of Athanasios (1090–1129) in ca. 1115, as well as of more friendly visits by<ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> (1166–99), who is said to have been enthroned on the chair of St. Peter during one of his visits in 1168–69, by Ignatius III Dawid (1222–52), who built a residence for himself on the outskirts of the city some time before 1246, and by<ref type="cr">Yuḥanon bar Maʿdani</ref> (1252–63), who was enthroned on the ‘chair of Great Severus’ in 1253. The Syr. Orth. had three churches in the city in 1170 (Yoldat Aloho, Mor Giwargis and Mor Barṣawmo). The visit to Antioch by Patr. Ignatius Zakka Iwas in 2000 was probably the first by a Syr. Orth. patriarch since the 13th cent.</p>
<p>In the 1920s there was a small community of Maronites in Antioch, who together with the Latin rite Christians numbered about fifty, alongside larger communities of Melkites numbering some 4,500 and Armenians numbering 400 in a total population of 20,000–30,000. Today, the city still has functioning Melk. Orth. and Latin churches. St. Peter’s Church, or Grotto, the cave believed to be the site of the first church in Antioch, lies about 2 km. to the northeast of the town center.</p>
<p>The Black Mountain (the Amanus Range) to the northwest of Antioch was a renowned center of monasticism. A number of Syriac liturgical mss. copied there attest to the continued use of Syriac alongside Greek and Georgian by Melkite monks in the region in the 11th cent.</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Anṭun of Tagrit</head>
<LemmaComment>(9th cent.?) 
<label type="affiliation">Syiac Orthodox</label><anchor/>
</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Author of uncertain date, designated ‘rhetor’ and ‘philoponos’, according to a ms. colophon from the family of Gurgin (<i>d-beth Gurgin</i>), and a monk. Nothing is known of him apart from his works and a brief report in the Ecclesiastical History of<ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> to the effect that he lived at the time of the patriarch<ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> (active in 825), a view which Bar ʿEbroyo declares to be generally accepted by his contemporary teachers and elders. Bar ʿEbroyo supports this by identifying an unnamed student of Greek poetry in Anṭun’s ‘Rhetoric’ with Dionysios’s brother<ref type="cr">Theodosios of Edessa</ref>, translator of the poems of<ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>. The 9th-cent. dating of Anṭun has thus not gone uncontested. Mention of his works by later authors first appears in<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref> and Bar ʿEbroyo.</p>
<p>Two mss. in London (Brit. Libr. Add. 17,208 + Dayr al-Suryān 32 and Brit. Libr. Add. 14,726) contain all his known shorter writings and fragments of his major work, a treatise on rhetoric. The shorter writings comprise a substantial work ‘On Divine Providence’, notable not least for its knowledge of medicine, a treatise ‘On the Myron’, in its prologue largely identical with that by<ref type="cr">Mushe bar Kipho</ref> and probably dependent upon Pseudo-Dionysius, eight poems (five in letter form), and four liturgical hymns.</p>
<p>His most significant work is his treatise on rhetoric, in five books. Apart from the London fragments, the older mss. have perished or are now in a location difficult to access, but some copies were made from the late 19th cent. and have survived. These copies preserve the text in full, with the exception of the final part of the fifth book. The treatise is unique in Syriac literature, with the exception of its partial reproduction and paraphrasing in the ‘Book of Dialogues’ of Yaʿqub bar Shakko. It was greatly admired by Bar ʿEbroyo, who cited it frequently in his ‘Book of Splendors’ and prefaced it to the ‘Organon’ of<ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref> in the curriculum of ‘external’ (i.e. secular) works he wished to see studied in the schools.</p>
<p>The main importance of the work lies in the evidence it provides of a rhetorical tradition in Syriac which has clear points of contact with the Greek (see<ref type="cr">Rhetoric</ref>). It is most unlikely that Anṭun knew Greek, but he mentions having had a teacher in the reading of Homer, and much of the treatise can only be understood on the supposition that a considerable amount of Greek rhetorical theory had been incorporated into Syriac teaching. The work is also remarkable for the range of authors cited in it as rhetorical examples. For Anṭun, as for Greek Christian rhetors, Gregory of Nazianzus was the supreme model of eloquence, but Anṭun was proud of his Syriac heritage, and in his eyes Gregory shared this position with<ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, whose poetry also belonged to the sphere of rhetoric. In addition to many Greek and Syriac Christian authors, several pagan writers are cited, including Homer, Plutarch, Heliodorus, and an unknown Evodius and (Aramean) Wapha. Anṭun also exhibits knowledge of the Platonic political-philosophical concept of the philosopher-king, a concept which was also important in the thought of al-Fārābī, the great Muslim philosopher who studied with Syro-Arabic Christian Aristotelian philosophers in<ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> in the 10th cent.</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Apamea</head>
<anchor/>
<div type="body">
<p>One of the earliest Hellenistic city foundations in Syria, Apamea, situated on the Orontes ca. 90 km. south of<ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, from the 2nd cent. onwards was an important center of Middle- and Neo-Platonist philosophy. Both Numenius (late 2nd cent.) and Iamblichus (early 4th cent.) taught here.</p>
<p>In the first half of the 5th cent., the region of Apamea was home to the ascetic circle around<ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>. An important bp. of Apamea during Yoḥannan’s lifetime was Polychronius, the brother of<ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, whose biblical commentaries, written in Greek (not preserved) are sometimes quoted in the later Syriac tradition.</p>
<p>In the late 5th and the 6th cent., Apamea and the province of Syria Secunda, of which it was the capital, became divided between supporters and opponents of the Council of Chalcedon (451). The tension between the two groups can be clearly sensed from the correspondence of<ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref>, who during his tenure as Patr. (512–18) had difficulty imposing his authority on the diocese. Eventually Syria Secunda was instrumental in bringing about the restoration of Chalcedonian Orthodoxy in the Eastern Empire under the emperors Justin I (518–27) and Justinian (527–65). The Monastery of<ref type="cr">St.</ref><ref type="cr">Maron</ref>, in the Apamea region (although the exact location is not known), which was perhaps at the head of a confederation of like-minded monasteries, played an important role in these 6th-cent. developments. The Chalcedonian convictions of the monks of Saint Maron gradually became disconnected from Melk. (Byzantine) orthodoxy and, from the 7th cent. onwards, gave rise to the emergence of an independent branch of Chalcedonian Syriac Christianity, which later became known as<ref type="cr">Maronite</ref>. For the Maronites, the Apamea region is their cultural and monastic homeland, from which several centuries later, they transferred their ecclesiastical center to Lebanon.</p>
<p>Apamea had several churches, along with a synagogue (uncovered below one of the churches). Parts of mosaic floors are preserved. While the primary language of Apamea was Greek, an important Syriac inscription, mentioning Bp. Peter of Apamea (and dated to the year 827 ‘in the reckoning of the Apamaeans’, i.e., 515/16) was discovered at Maʿar Zayta (a small town to the southwest of Maʿarrat al-Nuʿmān). At a short distance from Apamea lies the town of Huarte, in which several churches were uncovered, along with a Mithraeum, underneath one of the churches. Some 50 km. north of Apamea is the likely place of origin of the famous<ref type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref>, with their extraordinary illuminations.</p>
<p>Apamea was abandoned in the early Islamic period and later fell into ruins. In 1930, a team of Belgian archeologists started excavating it. Interrupted during World War II, and resumed only in 1965, the excavations during the past several years have been under the direction of J.-Ch. Balty.</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Aphrahaṭ</head>
<LemmaComment>(fl. first half of 4th cent.)</LemmaComment><anchor/>
<div type="body">
<p>Syriac author of 23 ‘Demonstrations’, known as ‘the Persian Sage’. The name Aphrahaṭ, by which he is known today, is first found in<ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (d. 828). In the early 8th cent.<ref type="cr">Giwargi, bp. of the Arab tribes</ref> only knew of him as ‘the Persian Sage’ (V. Ryssel,<i>Georgs des Araberbischofs Gedichte und Briefe</i>[1891], 44–54), though the oldest ms. of his works (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,182, dated 474) names the author ‘Yaʿqub, the Sage of Persia’. Confirmation of Yaʿqub as his name comes from the early Armenian translation and from the Latin author Gennadius (ca. 500), though both have mistakenly taken him to be bp.<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> (d. 338), which is impossible, since the Demonstrations are provided with exact dates: 1–10 are dated to 336/7, 11–22 to 343/4, and 23 to August 345. They were clearly written in the Persian Empire, and by a person in some sort of authority (the late identification of him as a bp. of<ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> is baseless). The first group deals largely with ascetic topics, and Dem. 6–7 are particularly important witnesses to the role of the<CrossReferenceBold>bnay qyāmā</CrossReferenceBold> and<CrossReferenceBold>iḥidāye</CrossReferenceBold> in the Syriac proto-monastic tradition. Many of the second group concern Judaism and are aimed to combat Judaising tendencies among Christians. The long Dem. 14 stands apart, being described as a letter addressed to the bishops, priests, and people in<ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>. Dem. 21 has as its background Shapur II’s persecution. The final Dem. 23 provides a reply to certain questions posed to the author concerning the ‘blessing hidden in the cluster of grapes’ (Isaiah 65:8). The Demonstrations constitute the first major literary work in Syriac: the opening words of Dems. 1–22 provide an alphabetic acrostic, and several Demonstrations contain lengthy passages of carefully balanced artistic prose. Besides their literary interest, the Demonstrations are of great importance for the light they shed on many different topics, in particular: the character of Christianity in the Persian Empire and its ascetic developments, relations with Judaism, the early stages of Shapur’s persecution, and the history of the Syriac biblical text, together with its exegesis and Christology.</p>
<p>The Demonstrations are preserved in four mss., three of which date from the 5th and 6th cent. The 5th-cent. Armenian translation (1–19, attributed to Yaʿqub of Nisibis), was first published in 1756, over a century before the Syriac became known. There are translations of individual Demonstrations into Arabic (parts of 2–4, 6, 9; attributed to<ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>), Ethiopic (5, 8; attributed to Yaʿqub of Nisibis), and Georgian (6; attributed to<ref type="cr">Hippolytus</ref>).</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Apocalypses<anchor/>
</head>
<div type="body">
<p>Apocalypses, or Revelations, aim to disclose eschatological events and in order to enhance their authority they are often attributed to past authorities; sometimes it is an angel who makes the disclosure. Such works tend to be produced at times of crises in society.</p>
<p>Two Apocalypses are transmitted in the great Milan ms. of the<ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> OT (7a1), the ‘Revelation of Baruch’ and ‘The Book of Ezra the Scribe who is called Shelathiel’ (usually referred to as IV Esdras); both are edited (by S. Dedering and R. Bidawid) in<i>Vetus Testamentum Syriace</i> IV.3 (1973). Lections from both works are sometimes found, indicating their quasi-canonical authority. Both Apocalypses are of Jewish origin and are usually dated ca. AD 100; their original language was probably Hebrew. The Revelation of Baruch survives complete only in Syriac and an Arabic translation (ed. F. Leemhuis, A. F. J. Klijn, G. J. H. van Gelder, 1986) made from Syriac (a few fragments only are known in Greek); by contrast, IV  Esdras (confusingly also called II Esdras in modern translations of the Apocrypha/Deuterocanonical books) is also known in Latin, Armenian, Coptic (a fragment), Ethiopic, and Georgian; the intermediary Greek, however, is lost.</p>
<p>The NT Apocalypse of John is not part of the Peshitta canon, but two later W.-Syr. translations were subsequently made, one in the 6th cent. (ed. J. Gwynn, 1897, repr. 2005), the other ca. 615, by<ref type="cr">Ṭumo of Ḥarqel</ref> (photographic ed., A. Vööbus, CSCO 400, 1978). Older printed editions of the Peshitta NT include the Ḥarqlean version, while more recent ones give the 6th-cent. version. The book only occasionally received a commentary (notably by<ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>).</p>
<p>The Apocalypse of Paul purports to describe what Paul saw when he was raised to the ‘third heaven’ (2 Cor 12:2), and how he was given a tour of both paradise and the place of punishment. The work, which was originally written in Greek (ed. K. Tischendorff,<i>Apocalypses</i><i>Apocryphae</i> [1866, repr. 1966], 34–69), proved to be immensely popular, and was translated into many languages, including Syriac (ed. G. Ricciotti, in<i>Orientalia</i>2 [1933], 1–25, 120–49; ET by J. Perkins,<i>JAOS</i> 8 [1866], 183–212). It has usually been thought that the earliest form of the Apocalypse goes back to the 3rd cent., and that a ‘second edition’ was later issued, claiming that it had been discovered in a house in Tarsus in 388 (or possibly 420). More recently it has been proposed that the supposed ‘second edition’ was in fact the original form of the Apocalypse. The Syriac translation places the Tarsus narrative at the end, and has a preface by the translator at the beginning. The edition of a variant Syriac version is being prepared by A. Desreumaux. The Coptic Apocalypse of Paul, found at Nag Hammadi is a different work (ed. with FT, J.-M. Rosenthiel, 2005).</p>
<p>The turbulent political events of the 7th cent. gave rise to a number of texts of an apocalyptic nature, this time all composed in Syriac. The Persian invasion of the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire, capturing<ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> in 614 and the relic of the Cross, followed eventually by Heraclius’s successful compaigns and recovery of the Cross (630), probably provide the scenario for a poem (transmitted in three different forms) on Alexander the Great ‘and the Gates of the North’, attributed to<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, but evidently composed between 630 and 636 (ed. with GT, G. J. Reinink, CSCO 454–5, 1983; ET in E. A. W. Budge,<i>The History of Alexander the Great</i>[1889, repr. 1976], 163–200). This draws on a christianized form of the<ref type="cr">Alexander</ref> legend from not long before 630 which proved very influential (Budge,<i>History of Alexander</i>, 144–58 [ET], 255–75 [Syr.]).</p>
<p>Another Apocalypse making use of the theme of the ‘Gates of the North’ is the Syriac Apocalypse of Daniel (ed. with ET, M. Henze, 2001; ed. with Esperanto tr., M. Slabczyk, 2000). This work is completely different from the Greek Apocalypses of Daniel; Syriac is clearly its original language and parts of it are parallel with another Syriac apocryphon, the ‘Young Daniel, concerning the End’ (ed. H. Schmold, Ph. D. Diss., Hamburg; 1972). The lack of any indication of contemporary events, prior to ‘the End’, make it difficult to date these works, but the first half of the 7th cent. seems likely.</p>
<p>A<i>memrā</i> ‘On the End’, wrongly attributed to<ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> (<i>Sermo</i> III.5; ed. E. Beck, CSCO 320–1, 1972), which also makes use of the christianized Alexander legend, has been dated to ca. 640, soon after the Arab conquests, though it could alternatively come from a few decades later in the 7th cent. The unrelated Latin sermon ‘on the End’, also attributed to Ephrem, is probably later than the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius.</p>
<p>The Second Civil War (683–92) and the plague of 686–7 gave rise to the inclusion of a number of apocalyptic features in the final book 15 of<ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Penkaye</ref>’s ‘Book of the Main Points’, written ca. 687 in north Mesopotamia. The apocalyptic preface to the<ref type="cr">Testament of our Lord</ref>, translated by Yaʿqub (probably, of<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>) in 686/7 will also date from that time if the preface was indeed the work of the translator.</p>
<p>The immensely influential<ref type="cr">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</ref>, attributed to the bp. of that name who was martyred in 312 very probably dates from 691/2, the time of ʿAbd al-Malik’s tax reforms and the building of the Dome of the Rock (ed. with GT G. J. Reinink, CSCO 540–1, 1993; ET in P. J. Alexander,<i>The Byzantine Apocalyptic Tradition</i>[1985], 36–51; partial ET in A. Palmer,<i>The seventh century in the West-Syriac chronicles</i>[1993], 230–42). This draws on themes found in the<ref type="cr">Cave of Treasures</ref>, the<ref type="cr">Julian Romance</ref>, and the Alexander legend, and foretells, in eschatological terms, the end of Arab rule. Related to Pseudo-Methodius, but from slightly later, is the ‘Edessene Fragment’ (ed. F. Nau, in<i>JA</i> 11.9 [1917], 415–71; ET in Palmer,<i>The seventh century</i>, 243–50); following the example of Pseudo-Methodius, it draws further on the Julian Romance, and also on the legend of Queen Helena and Judas Quryaqos, for its portrayal of the Last World Emperor on Golgotha. The apocalyptic section in the<ref type="cr">Gospel of the Twelve Apostles</ref> attributed to John ‘the Little’, is thought to date from much the same time.</p>
<p>The extended apocalyptic section in the legend of Bḥira (see<ref type="cr">Sargis Bḥira</ref>) probably dates from about the mid-9th cent. in its present form, but its roots may go back to the end of the reign of Maʾmūn (813–33).</p>
<p>‘The Question asked by Ezra in the desert with his disciple Carpus concerning the end of the times of the Ishmaelites’ (ed. with GT, F. Baethgen, in<i>ZAW</i> 6 [1886], 193–211; ed. with FT, J.-B. Chabot, in<i>Revue</i><i>sémitique</i> 2 [1894], 242–50, 333–46) has been ascribed to many different dates, ranging from the 7th to 11th/12th cent. An Ethiopic version (unpublished) is also known.</p>
<p>The composition of pseudepigraphical apocalypses could also be for the purpose of personal ambition, as is indicated by a passage in<ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>’s Chronicle (XI.22) where he tells how Quryaqos bp. of Segestan and Bar Salta of<ref type="cr">Reshʿayna</ref> composed an ‘Apocalypse of Enoch’, foretelling the reign of Marwān (II) and his son, which they presented to Marwān in order to win his support in church affairs.</p>

<p>Bp. of<ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>and Cath. (484–495/6). Aqaq headed the Ch. of E. during a critical period of its history, when it adopted a strictly dyophysite Christology. Aqaq had studied at the<ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref>, where he became acquainted with the works of<ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. Among his fellow students were<ref type="cr">Narsai</ref> and<ref type="cr">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref>. Aqaq’s predecessor, Cath. Babowai, who had a strained relationship with Barṣawma, had also come into conflict with the Persian Emperor Peroz and was arrested and executed by the latter in 484. When Aqaq took office, therefore, the situation of Christianity in the Persian Empire was extremely precarious. Our main source for the history of his period is the<ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. There is no evidence of Aqaq’s involvement in a synod held in<ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref> in April 484. This may have been a limited synod of Barṣawma’s followers, of which no report is transmitted (and which Barṣawma himself later revoked). It was in the wake of this synod that Babowai was arrested and executed, and replaced by Aqaq. At a subsequent synod, held in Beth ʿEdray, in August-September 485 (of which also no report is preserved), peace between Barṣawma and Aqaq was established. A number of letters from this period, included in the Synodicon, confirm that Barṣawma and his followers eventually submitted to Aqaq. The stage was thus set for the Synod of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, of Febr. 486, in which a unified church, under Aqaq’s leadership, adopted dyophysite Christology. Additionally, measures were taken to restrain the (excessive) influence of ascetics outside their monasteries and to make marriage the preferred status for all clergy, including bishops, celibacy being relegated only to monasteries. The specific context of these measures is not yet clear. Should they be understood in response to ideas prevailing in the Zoroastrian society, or as reactions to over-active wandering monks, who also may have propagated Miaphysitism among Persian Christians? Apart from the information in the Synodicon, very little is known about Aqaq. The Chronicle of<ref type="cr">Siirt</ref> attributes to him a treatise ‘On faith’, written against the Miaphysites, and three discourses on fasting, none of which is preserved. The Chronicle also reports that Aqaq translated into Persian a treatise on the Christian faith by<ref type="cr">Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye</ref>, which was presented to the Persian emperor Qawad.</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Arabic, Syriac translations from<anchor/>
</head>
<div type="body">
<p>Translation from Syriac into Arabic is a well-known phenomenon. This is especially true for the translations of philosophical and scientific works that were made in the first Abbasid period by<ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥ</ref>ā<ref type="cr">q</ref> and others, which have been the object of significant scholarly research (see, e.g., Bergsträsser). Much less attention has, however, been paid to the opposite phenomenon: translations from Arabic into Syriac. It has even been suggested (by<ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> in his discussions with the vizier al-Maghribī) that the absence of such translations are proof of the superiority of Syriac science and culture. As a matter of fact, however, the Syrians already had translations from Arabic some time before Eliya. One may distinguish six different, unrelated fields:</p>
<p>1. The earliest category consists of ascetical and hagiographic material related to the life and spirituality of the monks from the Egyptian desert. Though most of these Syriac texts were translated from a Greek original (e.g the apophthegmata by<ref type="cr">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>), at least a few seem to have had an Arabic original, which in its turn goes back to a Coptic Vorlage: a panegyric on John the Small by a monk of<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> and the biography of Shenute by his disciple Besa (10th cent.).</p>
<p>2. The second field covers a few writings pertaining to Syriac entertainment literature, such as the stories of<ref type="cr">Kalila and Dimna</ref> (11th cent., by an E.-Syr. priest, in addition to an earlier Syriac version made from Pahlavi in the 7th cent.), ‘<ref type="cr">Sindbad</ref> the wise’,<i></i>and the tale of the ‘Ten viziers and the son of King Azad-Bekht’.</p>
<p>3. The next category is constituted by medical texts of Greek origin, which were translated in the first Abbasid period. Though in most cases these texts were translated directly from the Greek original into Syriac (which served as the basis of a subsequent Arabic translation), there are a few instances in which Arabic served as the intermediary between Greek and Syriac. Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq mentions that his co-religionist Yūḥannā b. Māsawayh, the private physician of several caliphs, requested that Ḥunayn’s nephew Ḥubaysh translate into Syriac three medical works by<ref type="cr">Galen</ref>, which were already available in an Arabic version. We may assume that the reason behind this request was that the very critical Ibn Māsawayh held that Syriac was more appropriate than Arabic for expressing scientific idioms. A Syriac version of Ḥunayn’s Arabic treatise<i>al-Masāʾil al-ṭibbiyya</i>‘Book of medical questions’ is preserved in some late Chald. mss., through there is no information about the translator (for discussion, see Teule, forthcoming).</p>
<p>4.<ref type="cr">Bar</ref> ʿ<ref type="cr">Ebroyo</ref> had a good knowledge of Muslim-Arabic literature. Many of his works can be characterized as sometimes literal, sometimes paraphrastic translations/adaptations of Arabic philosophical and religious writings, such as the ‘Ethicon’ and the ‘Book of the Dove’ (based on Ghazālī), the<i>Swād supyā</i> (based on Ibn Sinā), etc. In these cases, however, the author did not intend to make translations, and the origin of the source text was not revealed. Nevertheless, Bar ʿEbroyo did also compose several translations that were meant as such: the<i>Kitāb al-išārāt wa-al-tanbīhāt</i> by Ibn Sīna (Syriac<i>Ktobo d-remze wa-mʿironwoto d-Abu</i>ʿ<i>Ali bar Sīnā</i>), in which he acknowledges the authorship of Ibn Sīnā and does justice to the Islamic context of this work, Athīr al-Dīn al-Abharī’s<i>Zubdat al-Asrār</i> (lost), and possibly Ibn Sinā’s ‘Medical Canon’. Bar ʿEbroyo’s translation activities are to be understood in the context of the growing acceptance of Muslim cultural and religious influences characteristic of the so-called<ref type="cr">Syriac Renaissance</ref>.</p>
<p>In Bar ʿEbroyo’s writings, one can also find several quotations (in Syriac) from verses of the Qurʾān. We have no certainty about a complete Syriac translation of this work, but<ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>gives literal translations of several<i>sūra</i>s in his ‘Treatise against the Muslims’.</p>
<p>5. The most important category is composed of theological writings translated from Latin or other European languages into Arabic by Western missionaries (16th cent. and later) with the help of local Christians, which served as the basis for new translations into Syriac. Examples are the<i>Maḥzitā mriqtā</i> ‘the Polished Mirror’ by the Chald. Patr.<ref type="cr">Yawsep II</ref> (d. 1713), a Uniate apologetic treatise, translated by himself, in defense of the Primacy of the Pope, and the ‘Book of the Magnet’, a popular book of moral theology. The reason for these translations was that the Christian population under the authority of Yawsep II (Northern Mesopotamia) did not have sufficient knowledge of Arabic. This is explicitly mentioned by the Chald. priest Khidr from<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> (d. 1751), who translated into Syriac Arabic versions of European works or original Arabic treatises composed by Maron. or Syr. Catholic authors. The priest Yawsep Abraham from Rāwandūz (1832) translated the<i>Mizān al-zamān</i> ‘the Balance of Time’ an originally Italian work, which was popular in Uniate circles, as well as some other theological and spiritual treatises. He also made a Syriac translation (from Arabic) of the NT Catholic Letters. An Arabic work by the zealous defender of the Uniate cause, the Melk. author ʿAbdallāh Zākhir (d. 1748) is also extant in a Syriac translation, probably made in Mesopotamia (on the Trinity and Incarnation). This translation activity from Arabic substantially diminished in the 19th cent., when the Chald. clergy had direct access to Latin and Italian theological writings.</p>
<p>6. Some modern works written by authors like Bp.<ref type="cr">Yuḥanon Dolabani</ref> or Patr.<ref type="cr">Ignatius Afram Barsoum</ref>(especially his history of Syriac literature, translated into Syriac under the title<i>Brule bdire</i>) were translated from Arabic into Syriac.</p>

<div type="body">
<p>The Aramaic language belongs to the Northwest Semitic subfamily within the larger family of Semitic languages. To the same subfamily belong among others Hebrew, Phoenician, and Ugaritic. Aramaic itself consists of a great number of language forms (and indeed languages), spoken and written in many different scripts over a period of 3000 years. Aramaic always co-existed and interacted with other, related or non-related, languages. Among the Aramaic languages<ref type="cr">Syriac</ref> is by far the best documented language. Geographically, Aramaic first was used in various locations of the ‘Fertile Crescent’, in Syria and Mesopotamia. It later spread all over the Middle East and well into Central Asia. From the 6th cent. BC to the 7th cent. AD, Aramaic, in a variety of interrelated language forms, or ‘dialects’, was the most widespread language of the Middle East, co-existing first with Old Persian (6th–4th cent. BC), and then with Greek (3rd  cent. BC – 7th cent. AD), and Middle Persian (3rd– 7th cent. AD). Under the dominance of Arabic and Islam, Aramaic lived on among various religious minorities, Syriac Christianity being the most important among them. In the third millennium AD, Aramaic and Syriac are used by a few million people — Christians, Jews, Samaritans, and Mandaeans — in liturgy, literature, and/or in spoken dialects in the Middle East, Southern India, and the worldwide diasporas.</p>
<p>Various scholarly attempts have been made at classifying the Aramaic languages. One among them, first proposed by J. Fitzmyer, and slightly adapted by S. Kaufman among others, has become widely used. It is based on a five-fold division of Aramaic linguistic history.</p>
<p>1. Old Aramaic (ca. 900 – ca. 600 BC). Aramaic was used by semi-autonomous<ref type="cr">Aramean</ref> tribes in Syria, Palestine, and Mesopotamia. Royal and funerary inscriptions of the<ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> region exhibit a relatively, but not entirely, unified language in the Phoenician sphere of influence, while the bilingual inscription of the Tell Fakhariyya statue (northeast Syria) points to an Akkadian linguistic and cultural context. The script is nearly identical to the one found in the Phoenician inscriptions, from which it was borrowed.</p>
<p>2. Imperial, or Official Aramaic (ca. 600 – ca. 200 BC). Already in the later days of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (following the loss of independence of the Aramean city states), Aramaic began to be used for trade and communication. The expansion of Aramaic went on in the Neo-Babylonian Empire and culminated in the ‘official’ status that Aramaic achieved (along with Persian and Elamite) in the Achaemenid Persian Empire (mid-6th cent. – 330 BC). Along with inscriptions, a great number of texts on papyrus, parchment, and ostraca have been unearthed in Egypt. They evidence the use of Aramaic in official documents issued by, and addressed to, the Persian administration, in correspondence of a more private character, and in literary compositions. The Aramaic documents in the biblical book of Ezra and their narrative framework represent the same type of language. The official use of Aramaic implied that there was a certain linguistic and orthographical standard, even if individual texts often deviated from it. This standard remained authoritative for several centuries after the fall of the Persian Empire. Its literary variant has been called ‘Standard Literary Aramaic’.</p>
<p>3. Middle Aramaic (ca. 200 BC – ca. 250 AD). First, there is the continued use of the earlier standardized language, in such texts as the Aramaic chapters of the biblical book of Daniel, the Aramaic portions of the Dead Sea documents, and the earliest layer of the Jewish Targumim, or translations of the Hebrew Bible (Targum Onkelos for the Pentateuch and Targum Jonathan for the Prophets). Second, there are corpora of Aramaic inscriptions, produced in the Nabataean Empire (which had Petra as its capital), and in the city states of Ḥaṭra, Palmyra, and<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. These lost their independence in the 2nd and 3rd cent. AD. The languages of these places each slightly differ from one another and they are written in slightly different scripts, derived from the script used in the Persian period. Nabataean Aramaic exhibits features that are due to contact with Old North Arab­ian, which was widely spoken throughout the Nabatean Empire.</p>
<p>4. Late Aramaic (3rd cent. to ca. 1200 AD). From this period literary texts are preserved which received classical status in at least four different religious communities. At the same time, a clear distinction emerges between West-Aramaic and East-Aramaic dialects.</p>
<p>West-Aramaic texts were produced by Jews (Palestinian Targumim, Aramaic portions in the Palestinian Talmud and in the Midrashim, Aramaic compositions preserved among the Cairo Genizah documents  — many of the texts mentioned represent the Galilean Aramaic dialect), Samaritans (Targumim, hymns, and prose compositions); and Christians of the Jerusalem area (<ref type="cr">Christ­ian Palestinian Aramaic</ref>).</p>
<p>East-Aramaic texts were produced by Jews (parts of the Babylonian Talmud and Gaonic literature), Mandaeans (classical Mandaic literature), and Christians (Syriac). The status of Syriac has been somewhat disputed. While Syriac traditionally has been considered the westernmost of the East-Aramaic languages, some scholars now tend to classify it as a separate branch of late Aramaic. The language of<ref type="cr">Mani</ref> and of the early Manicheans must have been close to Syriac, but next to nothing has survived.</p>
<p>Jewish Aramaic texts are written in the Hebrew square script, which itself is an adaptation of the earlier Aramaic script. Samaritan Aramaic is written in a separate script, which derives from the earlier Hebrew script. Christian-Palestinian Aramaic is written in a<ref type="cr">script</ref> that is related to Esṭrangela, and Mandaic has its own script, likely derived from the Parthian/Late Iranian scripts. An interesting genre that existed across religious borders is that of the incantations written on ‘magic bowls’: texts that are very similar exist in Jewish (Babylonian) Aramaic, Mandaic, and Syriac (written either in Esṭrangela or in a different script, which has been called ‘Proto-Manichean’).</p>
<p>Each of these languages had its heyday in the pre-Islamic period, when the literary languages to a large extent reflected, and were nourished by, the spoken languages. In the Islamic period, when Arabic became more prominent, the literary languages gradually became disconnected from the waning spoken dialects, which survived in geographical and social isolation.</p>
<p>5. Modern Aramaic, or Neo-Aramaic (to the present day). While the classical languages, shaped and standardized in the previous period, continued to be transmitted and written — and do so up to the present day  — the spoken variants started having their own history, much of which went unrecorded. It is only in the 17th cent. that some dialects began to be written for the first time. This happened in Northern Iraq with Modern Jewish Aramaic and with Modern Syriac (see<ref type="cr">Sureth</ref>), which was written in and around<ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref>. In the 19th cent., under the impulse of American missionaries, a new literary language was created for the Christians of<ref type="cr">Urmia</ref> and its surroundings. First used for a new translation of the Bible, Literary Urmia Aramaic later was adapted and upgraded to serve as the vehicle of the<ref type="cr">Assyrian</ref> identity. As such it is still used today among E.-Syr. Christians in the Middle East and in the worldwide<ref type="cr">diaspora</ref>.</p>
<p>The modern spoken dialects are generally subdivided as follows:</p>
<p>a. West-Neo-Aramaic, spoken in Maʿlula and in a few neighboring villages to the north of Damascus by Christians (Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic) and by some Muslims. This language may be seen as an offshoot of West-Aramaic, described under 4. Some texts are available in contemporary scholarly transliterations.</p>
<p>b. Central-Neo-Aramaic, of which the main dialect is<ref type="cr">Ṭuroyo</ref>, spoken in<ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, mainly by Syr. Orth. Christians. The language is now widespread among the Syr. Orth diaspora. There have been a few attempts to write it down, most successfully among the Swedish communities (in Latin script).</p>
<p>c. North-East-Neo-Aramaic, spoken to the east of the Tigris, in Eastern Turkey, Persian Kurdistan, and Northern Iraq (north of<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>) by both Christians and Jews. Due to massive relocation throughout the 20th cent., originally distinct languages have been mixed and cases of Koine formation have emerged. Here again, many speakers live in the diaspora; Jewish Aramaic lives on in Israel.</p>
<p>d. South-East-Neo-Aramaic, represented by much endangered Mandaic dialects, spoken in southern Iraq and western Iran.</p>
<p>Each of these many modern dialects carries its own cultural and religious tradition. Linguistically they share a number of features, particularly in the radical transformation of the verbal system. In the lexicon, many loanwords were borrowed from the surrounding languages along with phonetic, morphological, and syntactical features.</p>
<p>In the Syriac tradition the term<i>ārāmāyā</i> (<i>oromoyo</i>) is often used, along with<i>suryāyā</i> (<i>suryoyo</i>), to denote the Syriac language. Syriac rewriting of texts originally composed in other Aramaic languages may be found in the Aramaic sections of the Old Testament and in such texts as the story of<ref type="cr">Aḥiqar</ref>. An awareness of an Aramean unity, based on the language (<i>leššānā</i> /<i>lešono</i>) and the written tradition (<i>seprā</i> /<i>sepro</i>), extending from the first Chaldean and Assyrian kings to the Christian Syrians, can be found in the second Appendix added to the Chronicle of<ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, which deals with ‘the kingdoms that have been established in Antiquity by our race, (that of) the Arameans, namely the descendants of Aram, who were called Syrians or inhabitants of Syria’ (ed. J. B. Chabot, text in vol. 4, 748–51 ; FT in vol. 3, 442–7). Among the present-day Syr. Christians the Aramaic heritage is particularly emphasized by the Syr. Orth.</p>

<div type="body">
<p>Arameans feature in the annals of the Assyrian kings for some four centuries (ca. 1100–700 BC), apparently having settled more or less all around the Fertile Crescent; the geographical term<ref type="cr">Beth Aramaye</ref> in Syriac sources reflects their presence in Babylonia as recorded in the Assyrian annals. In the course of the 10th cent. BC a number of small independent Aramean kingdoms, using<ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> in their inscriptions, emerged in what is today Syria, though over the course of the next two centuries they all became subject to the Assyrian Empire, a fate shared with Israel and Judah. The often hostile relations between the Aramean kings and those of Israel and Judah are related in the OT (Kings and Chron.). Syriac readers of the<ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>, however, would have known these (with the exception of Rezin) as ‘Edomites’, rather than ‘Arameans’, since the Syriac translators evidently thought that the Arameans lived only to the East of the Euphrates (thus Laban remains an ‘Aramean’, Gen. 31:20). In the Peshitta NT, by contrast, ‘Aramean’ renders ‘Hellene’ in the sense of ‘gentile, pagan’ (e.g. Acts 21:28; Rom. 1:16). At some point a distinction was introduced between the two senses, ethnic (<i>ārāmāyā</i>) and pagan (<i>armāyā</i>); the first definite attestation for the latter is in a<i>memrā</i> by<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (ed. Bedjan, V, 474) where the three-syllable form is demanded by the meter (<i>armāyā</i> is the vocalization that is later provided for all the NT passages).</p>
<p>In many Syriac writers<i>Ārāmāyā</i> and<i>Suryāyā</i> are synonyms; normally this refers to the language, but on occasion they are used as alternate ethnic terms: thus in the early Syriac translation of<ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref>’s ‘Ecclesiastical History’<ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref> is described both as a<i>suryāyā</i> (ed. Wright, 183) and as an<i>ārāmāyā</i> (243). Likewise<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, in his ‘Encheiridion’ and elsewhere, speaks of ‘we Suryāye, or Ārāmāye’. This equation is further elaborated in Appendix II to<ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>’s Chronicle. In modern times the ethnic identity of ‘Aramean’ has been taken up in some circles of the W.-Syr.<ref type="cr">diaspora</ref> as a corrective to the popularity of<ref type="cr">Assyrian</ref> themes.</p>

<div type="body">
<p>Capital of modern Kurdistan, in eastern Iraq. It was already inhabited in the 4th millennium BC; in the oldest cuneiform texts it is called<i>Urbilum</i> (Assyrian<i>Arbaʾilu</i>). One of the stations along the royal road between Sardes and Persepolis, it was a cultic center, with a temple devoted to the fertility goddess Ishtar, as well as a center of commerce and a main point on the caravan routes. It was held successively by the Babylonians, Persians, and Greeks, and it was very near Arbela that Darius III was defeated by Alexander the Great (331 BC). It was during Alexander’s rule that the country surrounding Arbela became known as<ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref> (Syr.<i>Ḥadyāb</i>), which later became part of the Parthian Empire, and eventually a governor’s seat during the Sasanian period. In the 1st cent. AD, Adiabene became an independent kingdom, subject to the Parthian king, but it remained on the periphery of the battle zone between Rome and Parthia. It was in Adiabene, according to<ref type="cr">Josephus</ref>, that the royal family converted to Judaism in the 1st cent. AD.</p>
<p>Arbela was christianized at a very early date and its inhabitants quickly became the victims of persecution by the local governor. The history of its Christian beginnings is recounted in the Chronicle of Arbela, a late and dubious mélange of biographical sketches of the twenty early bishops of Arbela (ca. 104–511). According to this Chronicle, Pekhida, a disciple of Addai, became the first bp.; during the tenure of Isḥaq, the third bp., the first church in Arbela was built. The Chronicle also bears testimony — and this may be the most historical witness of this text — that many of Arbela’s bishops and faithful suffered martyrdom at the hands of the Persians. The<ref type="cr">Acts of Mari</ref>, a seemingly more reliable source, claims rather that Aggai and Mari, missionaries from<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, were the first evangelists of Adiabene, and its first bps. Arbela was for some time the metropolitan seat of the region of Adiabene, and boasted of several important figures as bishops — of whom three later became patriarchs  — who appear in the signatory lists of the synods of the Ch. of E. A Christian school located in Arbela also produced a number of important monastic figures and bps. In 1295, a second Mongol invasion destroyed the Christian churches, killed many Christians, and drove the surviving Christians into other regions. Subsequent persecutions were sufficiently harsh that, by the end of the 17th cent., there were no remaining Christians in Arbela; small groups had begun to re-immigrate in the early part of the 20th cent.</p>

</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Greek Philosopher. In Late Antiquity the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle were considered to be in harmony, and not in conflict; accordingly the syllabus for studying philosophy began with Aristotle (commencing with his logical works, the ‘Organon’, or ‘Tool’), leaving Plato to the climax. This accounts for the fact that the early books of the ‘Organon’ (‘Categories’, ‘On Interpretation’, and ‘Prior Analytics’ [at first only to I.7]) were the first works of Aristotle to be translated (along with<ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Introduction’), and it is only these that actually survive, although there is evidence that much more was translated; it also accounts for the fact that no genuine works by Plato were ever translated into<ref type="cr">Syriac</ref>.</p>
<p>The Syriac translations fall into three main periods: 1. the earliest, anonymous, translations probably belonging to the early 6th cent.; these survive, and are confined to the early books of the ‘Organon’; 2. the 7th- and early 8th-cent. revisions by<ref type="cr">Athanasios of Balad</ref>,<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, and<ref type="cr">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>, several of which survive; the later books of the ‘Organon’ were also translated by Athanasios, but these are no longer extant; Ya<ref type="cr">ʿ</ref>qub evidently knew the ‘Metaphysics’, but that work appears never to have been translated into Syriac; 3. further revisions and new translations made in the course of the ‘translation movement’ patronised by the Abbasid caliphs; the new translations also included many other works, beyond the ‘Organon’ (see Peters); hardly any of these survive in their original form, since they were usually made just to serve as the basis for further translation into Arabic; some use of them, however, was made by<ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> in his ‘Cream of Wisdom’ and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The earliest Syriac commentators, (for whom, see Hugonnard-Roche,<i>La logique</i>, 123–291),<ref type="cr">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref>,<ref type="cr">Proba</ref>, and<ref type="cr">Pawlos the Persian</ref>, all belong to the early or mid-6th cent. (on internal evidence the 5th-cent. date sometimes given to Proba cannot be correct). In the 7th cent.<ref type="cr">Severos Sebokht</ref> wrote on syllogisms, while Athanasios of Balad wrote an Introduction to Aristotelian logic, and Ya<ref type="cr">ʿ</ref>qub of Edessa provided an ‘Encheiridion’ of philosophical terms. Giwargi’s revision of the first three books of the Organon (including the whole of the ‘Prior Analytics’) is accompanied by introductions to a number of the books, as well as annotation. E.-Syr. authors from<ref type="cr">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref> and<ref type="cr">Babai</ref> onwards also show an awareness of Aristotle’s logical works, and writings dealing with topics in the ‘Organon’ by<ref type="cr">Michael Badoqa</ref>,<ref type="cr">Ishoʿbokht</ref>,<ref type="cr">Silwanos of Qardu</ref> (who knows all the books of the ‘Organon’; CSCO 464, p. 35),<ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>, and others survive, but no specific commentaries are preserved. A glimpse at the translation movement in action is given by<ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> in his Letters 43 and 48, on translating the ‘Topics’. From the late 12th cent. a commentary reaching the ‘Analytics’ by<ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> survives (ms. Cambridge Gg. 2.14). In the early 13th cent. both<ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref> and<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref> (in his ‘Dialogues’) are concerned with related topics; a little later Bar ʿEbroyo, in his<i>Ktobo d-boboto</i> covers in brief the whole of the ‘Organon’, while his ‘Cream of Wisdom’ serves as a general compendium of almost all aspects of Aristotelian philosophy.</p>
<p>Besides two short biographies (ed. Baumstark,<i>Aristoteles</i>, 2*–3*), a number of works falsely under Aristotle’s name were also translated into Syriac, the most notable being the<i>Peri</i><i>Kosmou</i> (‘On the universe’; ed. de Lagarde,<i>Analecta</i><i>Syriaca</i> , 134–58), translated by Sergios of Reshʿayna. Although it was once thought that the Arabic Neoplatonist work known as the ‘Theology of Aristotle’ was translated from a lost Syriac text, this is now considered improbable.</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Armenian Christianity, Syriac contacts with<anchor/>
</head>
<div type="body">
<p>Armenia, the geographical area of Armenian Christianity and culture, borders the homeland of Syr. Christianity. For centuries,<ref type="cr">Arameans</ref> and Armenians lived together in parts of northern Mesopotamia and northern Syria. The main cities of Syr. Christianity,<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>(Armenian<i>Uṙhay</i>) and<ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>(Armenian<i>Mcbin</i>) had a mixed population, which included Syrians and Armenians. Within the Sasanian Empire, the lines of demarcation between the Ch. of E. and the Armenian Church were very porous. The E.-Syr. ecclesiastical province of<ref type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>, which since the synod of<ref type="cr">Isḥaq</ref> (410) had Nisibis as its metropolitan see, included the dioceses of Arzun, Qardu, Beth Zabdai, Beth Rahimai, and Beth Moksaye, which all had large Armenian populations and which occasionally show up as dioceses of the Armenian Church. In these and in other borderlands, there must have been a significant amount of bilingualism, reflecting a ‘veritable interpenetration’ between the two groups (Garsoïan 1992, 63).</p>
<p><Lemma>In the 1st cent. BC, the western part of Armenia was incorporated into the Roman Empire, while the larger part (‘Great Armenia’) remained within the Iranian sphere of influence, at times enjoying independence, at times ruled by Parthian and later Sasanian monarchs. Around 387 the Roman and Sasanian Empires agreed on a formal partition of Armenia (even though the frontier subsequently shifted). Despite the fact that in its formative period Armenian Christianity, not unlike Syr. Christianity, was divided over two empires, this did not lead — as in the case of the Syrians — to doctrinal division. This is often attributed to a stronger sense of ethnic and cultural identity among the Armenians than among the Syrians. In the Islamic period Armenians occasionally had their own kingdom, such as under the Bagratid dynasty, from the end of the 9th to the middle of the 11th cent. From the late 12th cent. to 1375, an independent Armenian kingdom existed in Cilicia (‘Little Armenia’), where many Armenians had settled. Cilician Armenia accepted union with Rome at the Council of Sis in 1307, but this union, which failed to receive support outside Cilicia, came to an end with the demise of the Cilician kingdom. In the Ottoman Empire, Armenians at first flourished. The patriarchate of Constantinople (Istanbul) was created to represent Armenian interests (and often other Christians’ interests as well) at the capital. Armenians also lived in parts of Persia and Russia, and there were diaspora communities as far as Lemberg (Galicia, present-day Lwow in Poland). Significant emigration to Europe and North America started in the middle of the 19th  cent. The early 20th cent. saw the Armenian genocide, which largely coincided with the</head>
<ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref><Lemma>, and which was followed by further dispersion. The short-lived independent Armenian Republic (1918–1920) became part of the Soviet Union in 1920, to regain its independence only in September 1991.</p>
</head>
<p>Christianity came to Armenia no later than the 3rd cent. and the Armenian Church was first organized by Gregory the Illuminator in the early 4th cent. An important factor in the development of Armenian Christianity was the invention of the Armenian script by Maštoc‘ (Mesrop), traditionally dated in or around 407, and preceded by Maštoc‘’s travels through Syria and Edessa. This was followed by a period of intense translation activity, from both Greek and Syriac. Prior to the invention of their own script, Armenians used Greek and Syriac as their literary and liturgical languages.</p>
<p>Among the translations of the earliest period (first half of the 5th cent.) are several Syriac texts, such as the Demonstrations of<ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, transmitted in Armenian under the name of<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> (ed. Lafontaine), several works by<ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>(Armenian: Ephrem Asori ‘the Assyrian’ or ‘Syrian’), and a short treatise attributed to bp.<ref type="cr">Aitalaha</ref> of Edessa, which is not preserved in Syriac. Ephrem’s Armenian works include the undoubtedly genuine ‘Hymns on Nicomedia’, which were written shortly after 358, and of which only a few Syriac fragments exist (ed. Renoux), and the Commentary on the<ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref> (ed. Leloir). While for these two works (as well as for Aphrahaṭ) we are dealing with quite faithful translations of Syriac originals, the relationship to the Syriac original is more problematic for other works attributed to Ephrem, such as a collection of hymns (ed. Mariès and Mercier), which seem to contain Syriac materials, but may represent later rewritings, and an anti-Marcionite exposition of the Gospel (ed. Egan), which is probably not by Ephrem (see Bundy, against the view of the editor), even though a 4th-cent. Syriac original is very likely. In addition to the translations of originally Syriac works, some Greek patristic works were translated into Armenian not from Greek, but from an earlier Syriac translation. The two most well-known examples are<ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History and<ref type="cr">Basil of Caesarea</ref>’s Homilies on the Hexaemeron. In the earliest layers of Armenian biblical and liturgical texts as well, the mark of Armenia’s early contacts with the Syriac world is clearly visible. Among indigenous Armenian authors who are well informed about Syriac Christianity and write about it or borrow themes or interpretations from it are Eznik of Kołb (author of a work known as either ‘Against the sects’ or ‘On God’), Koriwn (author of ‘The Life of Maštoc‘’), the author of the ‘Teaching of Gregory’ (incorporated into the ‘History of Agathangelos’), and the author of the ‘Epic histories’ (formerly known as Faustus of Byzantium).</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council’s condemnation of Antiochene theo­logy, Armenian Christianity moved away from the Syriac sphere of influence and increasingly turned to the Greek imperial church. The Council of Chalcedon (451) at first did not have an impact on the Armenians, who at the same time were involved in the Battle of Avarayr (the outcome of which led to full Sasanian rule over Armenia). It is only in the course of the 6th cent. that church leaders and councils determined Armenia’s own theological position, partly in response to missionary activity carried out by representatives of the emerging Syr. Mia­physite Church and of the Dyophysite E.-Syr. Church. Even though the Armenians repeatedly took a position against dyophysitism, associated with<ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref> as well as with the Ch. of E., a straightforward rejection of the Council of Chalcedon only took place at the Council of Dvin in 607. From the 6th-cent. documents of the Armenian church (preserved in the ‘Book of Letters’) it appears that, in contrast with the Syr. Orth. and Coptic Miaphysite churches, the works of<ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> did not obtain normative status in Armenia, but rather that a form of aphthartodocetism gradually became the official doctrine (regarding the body of Christ as inherently incorruptible). The question of whether this was associated with<ref type="cr">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref> (whose works seem not to have been translated into Armenian), Severus’s opponent, or whether this had different roots and was nourished perhaps by the writings of<ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>, some of which were translated into Armenian (see Ter-Minassiantz, 147–51, and more recently Cowe), has not yet been fully settled. Due to this different orientation within the Miaphysite tradition, there was always some distance between the Armenian Orth. and the Syr. Orth. Church, and occasionally some tension (Ter-­Minassiantz). A list of historical complaints of the Syrians against the Armenians is found in treatises by<ref type="cr">Yuḥanon X bar Shushan</ref> and<ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>.</p>
<p>In spite of the theological complexities in their relationship, contacts and exchanges between Syr. and Armenian Christians continued throughout the centuries. In the early Islamic period, both the Ch. of E. and the Syr. Orth. Church had a presence in parts of the Armenian lands. Since the 8th cent., there was in Khilat (or Akhlat), on the western shore of Lake Van, an E.-Syr. metropolitan bp. as well as a Syr. Orth. bp. (Fiey 2003, 1427), while an E.-Syr. bp. also is attested for Bardaʿa (Armenian Partaw), on the Terter River (Van Lantschoot 1932). The E.-Syr. metropolitan see of Khilat was later given up as an independent see and added to Nisibis, whose metropolitan bp. in the 13th cent. had ‘Nisibis and Armenia’ in his title (Fiey,<i>Nisibe</i>, 106). Translation activity from Syriac into Armenian went on. For example, some of<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>’s exegetical work found its way into an Armenian commentary attributed to Ephrem (ed. Mathews), and the 9th-cent. Commentary on the Gospel of John by<ref type="cr">Nonos of Nisibis</ref> is preserved only in Armenian.</p>
<p>Intense contacts on all levels took place in the period of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Many Syrians must have settled in the relative safety of Cilicia, where the Syr. Orth. had bp. sees in Adana, Anazarba (ʿAyn Zarba), Sis (patriarchal residence between 1292 and the early 15th cent.), and Tarsus. There were Syr. Orth. monasteries in Cilicia as well, in particular those of Gawikat (or Kawikhat) and Paksimeṭ (or Baksimeṭ).<ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, in his Chronicle, provides a wealth of information on Armenian history; in addition, one of the appendices to the Chronicle (no. 5) explicitly deals with the Armenians. Of Michael’s Chronicle two different translations were produced, one in 1246, by the Armenian author Vardan Arewelc‘i in collaboration with the Edessene monk Yeshuʿ (of Ḥeṣno d-Kifo, see Barsoum), the other in 1248 by Vardan alone (possibly after Yeshuʿ’s death). The translation was made from Michael’s autograph, which along with other mss. had been transferred from the<ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref> to Hṙomklay (Qalʿa Rumayta), where the Syr. Orth Patr. Ignatius Dawid resided for some time and where a Syr. Orth. church had been built. Both translations present a periphrastic and much shortened version of Michael’s Chronicle (Schmidt 1996). Other translations from Syriac made in Cilician Armenia include the ‘Syro-Roman Lawbook’ and the ‘Sententiae Syriacae’ (see<ref type="cr">Juridical literature</ref>); homilies by<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (Weitenberg, 349 and 350); the Psalm Commentary by<ref type="cr">Daniel of Ṣalaḥ</ref>; and several works of medical content. A unique work on horse-medicine (written ca. 1300) was translated from Arabic, but the author explicitly identifies himself as a veterinary of Syrian descent and creed. Translations typically resulted from the collaboration of an Armenian and a Syriac native speaker (Weitenberg, with further references). While all the examples quoted here concern Syriac writings translated into Armenian, an interesting case of a Syrian author’s interest in Armenian may be seen in<ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s biblical commentaries, which in particular in the commentary on Psalms contain about 160 quotations of, or references to, the Armenian Bible (Göttsberger). The fall of the Cilician kingdom (1375) brought the close contacts between the Armenian and Syr. Orth. intellectual elite to an end, even though for the subsequent centuries further evidence exists of the ongoing interaction between Syriac and Armenian Christians (see, e.g., Kaufhold).</p>
<p>Among the cities in which Armenians and Syrians lived together for many centuries, Edessa assumes a special position. The Armenian presence there can be traced back to a very early period and some sources (including Yaʿqub of Edessa, in his Chronicle) present king Abgar and the original population of Edessa as Armenian. The story of Abgar’s conversion to Christianity became widely popular in Armenian, whereby an increasing Armenization took place, from its first attestation in Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History and the 5th-cent. work attributed to Labubna, or Łerubna (the Edessene king’s scribe who is also mentioned in the Syr.<ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref>) to the rewritten versions in Moses Xorenac‘i’s ‘History of the Armenians’ (probably 9th cent.) and the 10th-cent. historians Thomas Arcruni and Uxtanes. When the short-lived Crusade principality of Edessa fell to the Seljuks in 1144, the Armenians were bewildered as much as the Syr. Christians were (see Dionysios bar Ṣalibi), as is shown by the lament written by Nerses Shnorhali (ET van Lint), the later Cath. of all Armenians (1166–99), who is known for his friendly relationship with Michael Rabo.</p>
<p>The contacts between Armenian and Syr. Christians are also reflected in art, as is illustrated in the 9th-cent. illuminated Gospel ms. of Queen Mlke (Venice, San Lazzaro 1144), which has been connected with the Syriac<ref type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref> (Stone et al.).</p>
<p>For the more recent period (16th–18th cent.) a number of Syriac-Armenian lexica are attested, reflecting language contact and bilingualism. Both within these lexica and outside of them, interesting examples of boundary crossing between the two langauges are found in Armenian texts written in Syriac script and in (at least) one Syriac text written in Armenian script (Van Lantschoot 1964, Brock, Schmidt 2007, Takahashi and Weitenberg [forthcoming]).</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Art and architecture<anchor/>
</head>
<div type="body">
<p>A comprehensive study of Syr. Christian art and architecture is still missing, and only a few subfields are relatively well covered in overview monographs, such as the architecture of Syria west of the Euphrates (Butler; Lassus; Tchalenko), floor mosaics in churches of Syria and Lebanon (Donceel-Voûte), manuscript illumination (Leroy 1964), and wall paintings in Syria and Lebanon (Cruikshank Dodd; Immerzeel 2009). Given Syr. Christianity’s intertwinement, throughout its history, with other linguistic, cultural, and religious traditions, the definition of what constitutes ‘Syr. Christian’ art or architecture is somewhat elusive and should not be attempted here. In the early period much of Syr. Christianity was situated in the Roman Empire, in which there was a great deal of overlap between Syr. Christian and Greek Christian art and culture. In the Islamic period certain forms of art were shared between Syr. Christians and Muslims. In addition, the proximity of Byzantine Christianity or even Western Christianity (esp. in the period of the<ref type="cr">Crusades</ref>) had its impact on themes and forms of expressions. There is some evidence in the early Syr. tradition of the use of portable icons (the image of<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, which was believed to be a portrait of Jesus, being the most famous of these), but it is only among the Christians of the Chalcedonian traditions (Melkite and Maronite) that the art of icon painting flourished and that local styles emerged, such as in the 13th cent. in Tripoli and in the 17th cent. in<ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>. In the other Syr. traditions (Syr. Orth. and Ch. of E.) the cult of images in whatever form never became as prominent as it was in the Byzantine tradition, even though there is no evidence of any opposition to the use of figurative art, and suggestions that Syr. Christianity was somehow connected to the iconoclastic movement within the Byzantine tradition or to any other an-iconic tradition should be rejected (Brock 2004; Teule). In general, the study of Syr. Christian art and architecture is seriously hampered by the fact that the surviving remains are fragmentary and mostly deprived of their original context. Accompanying<ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref>, occasionally containing dates and names, may provide crucial information. In the present overview only a few areas will be highlighted.</p>
<label>1. Pre-Christian Edessa</label>
<div type="body">
<p>The art of the semi-independent kingdom of Edessa is accessible to us in a number of funerary mosaics, dated or datable to the first three cent. AD (prior to the mid–3rd cent.). Some of these show portraits of the deceased, often with their family; others have topics or figures from Greco-Roman antiquity, such as the Phoenix or Orpheus playing the lyre. Reflecting the life of the urban aristocracy, the mosaics show the proximity of the Parthian world, in particular in the costumes (Leroy 1957). Most of the mosaics (some of which are dated in their inscriptions) are contemporaneous with the nascent Christian communities in Edessa, and with our earliest Christian authors, such as<ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>, but none of them can be identified as specifically Christian (Drijvers and Healey; Healey; Segal).</p>
<label>2. Christian Architecture in Syria, Ṭur ʿAbdin, and Mesopotamia</label>
<div type="body">
<p>The earliest dated church in the Syr. Christian area is the church of<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref>which in a baptistery inscription that survives to the present day is dated to 359, i.e. the time when<ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>lived in the city. Even though we are in the easternmost corner of the Roman Empire and in the heartland of Syr. Christianity, the inscription is not in Syriac, but in Greek.</p>
<p>Most of the evidence for churches between the 4th and 7th cent. is from the region between<ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>and Aleppo. Known as the ‘Dead cities’, because they were abandoned in the early Islamic period due to shifting patterns of economy and trade (and are still largely deserted today), numerous sites show the secular and religious buildings of villages and medium-size communities. Several churches are impressive, and the architectural skeleton of some of them is well-preserved, having been exposed to the forces of nature only, not to re-use or destruction by humans. Some churches are very small (such as the single-aisled church of Qirqbize). Other churches derive their importance from their role as pilgrim destinations, such as the church of Qalbloze, and above all the magnificent church of<ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>, which was built in the late 5th cent. and which consists of four three-aisled basilicas converging on the saint’s pillar. Even today the scattered ruins and the very refined capital sculptures evoke the church’s former majesty. Another popular pilgrim destination, which flourished in the 6th cent., is the shrine of Mar Sargis (St. Sergius) in Resafa, more eastwards in the Syrian steppe (ca. 160  km. southeast of Aleppo).</p>
<p>The region of<ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> and the wider area around it also preserve some of the earliest churches of Syr. Christianity, some of which were expanded throughout the centuries and are still in use today. The well-preserved main church of<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> dates back to the 6th cent., while some of the rebuilding and refurbishment of the church of the<ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref> can be dated to the reign of the Byzantine emperor Anastasius (r. 491–518). Several other churches in this area go back to the early Islamic period, such as the church of Ḥaḥ and the church of the Holy Cross, in the monastery of the same name (<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Ṣalīb</ref>).</p>
<p>A special architectural feature in some of the earliest churches is the bema. This is a raised platform, usually horseshoe-shaped and with low walls, which is located in the middle of the nave and on which the liturgy of the Word was performed. The above-mentioned churches of Qirqbize, Qalbloze, and Resafa provide interesting examples, while detached pieces of the bema construction have found their way to modern museums, such as the stone bema lectern of Bennawi, which is presently shown in the garden of the National Museum of<ref type="cr">Damascus</ref> (Brock and Taylor,<i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol. 2, 43). In recent years the bema has received considerable attention, both from liturgists and archeologists (Cassis, Loosley, Renhart, and Taft).</p>
<p>Several other detached pieces of church decoration, chancel panels, or door lintels, exhibiting ornamental motifs or iconographical themes, are found scattered all over the world. Two chancel panels in stone, uncovered at Rasm al-Qanafez (to the east of Salamiyya, Syria) and presently in the National Museum of Damascus, show Daniel among the lions and the three Magi approaching the Virgin with Child (<i>Syrie</i>, 358–59; Peña, 84).</p>
<p>Floor mosaics as well often have left their original location. Most of the mosaics belonging to churches in Syria and Lebanon have conveniently been brought together by P. Donceel-Voûte, with the ‘Adam mosaic’ in the Michaelion of Huarte (ca. 15 km. north-northeast of<ref type="cr">Apamea</ref>) as one of the highlights (Donceel-Voûte, 105), to be compared with the royal Adam shown on a mosaic panel in the Museum of Ḥama, the latter with a Greek and Syriac caption (ibid., 113; also in Brock and Taylor,<i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol.<i></i>2, 41). More recently beautiful mosaics have been uncovered at Tall Biʿa, near Raqqaʿ/Kallinikos, in the church of a monastery that may have been the Monastery of Mar Zakkay, to which<ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Tella</ref> once belonged (Kalla, with further references).</p>
<p>While by far the largest part of our evidence for the early period belongs to the W.-Syr. tradition (in particular Syr. Orth. and Melkite), there has been in recent years considerable and promising archeological activity in the geographical area of the Ch. of E. (Hauser; Kröger, with further references). The Christian monuments of Iraq (belonging to either the Ch. of E. or the Syr. Orth. tradition), a number of which go back to the first millennium, have been surveyed by Fiey in his three-volume publication<i>Assyrie chrétienne</i>, while the same scholar devoted a separate volume to<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> (1959). Sites of particular significance are the city of<ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref> (Harrak 2001),<ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> and<ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Behnam</ref> (nowadays Syr. Cath.), with its exceptional 13th-cent. carvings on the main entrance door. There is also some evidence of building activity associated with the Ch. of E. in the Holy Land, in particular a hermitage near Jericho (Fiey 1983, and Brock and Taylor,<i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol. 2, 46) and possibly a monastic complex at Tel Masos, in the northern Negev (Fritz and Maiberger).</p>
<label>3. Manuscript Illumination</label>
<div type="body">
<p>An excellent survey of illuminated mss. kept in Western and Middle-Eastern libraries, with detailed analysis, is available in Leroy 1964. The most significant set of early illuminations is found in the opening quire of the 6th-cent. ms. that contains the<ref type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref> (named after the scribe of the Gospel text), with its richly decorated canon tables and its full-page illuminations. Of the same period, or possibly slightly later, is the so-called ‘Syriac Bible from Paris’ (Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 341), which contains mostly OT themes and figures (Sörries). The art of ms. illumination came to full fruition in the 11th to 13th cent.: along with biblical mss., such as the ‘Buchanan Bible’ (ms. Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Oo.I.1,2; on which, see Hunt), there are a number of lectionaries, most of them belonging to the Syr. Orth. tradition. The number of E.-Syr. illuminated mss. is very limited (for some 15th-cent. examples, see Leroy, 417–18 and 393–403; Brock and Taylor,<i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol.<i></i>2, 237–38). In the 16th cent. the tradition of ms. illumination was given new life among the Chaldeans (see e.g. ms. Borgia Syr. 169, Leroy, 404–8). For more recent studies, esp. on the Syr. Orth. mss. of the 11th–13th cent., see e.g. Doumato. It should also be noted that ms. illumination is not limited to the mss. of the mainstream ecclesiastical traditions, but is also found, e.g., in magic mss. (Balicka-Witakowska 2008).</p>
<label>4. Wall Paintings</label>
<div type="body">
<p>Most of the late antique churches must have contained painting, either of a purely ornamental nature or intended to provide instruction or to impart devotion. Remains of painting can be found on some of the ruins, but no full Christian wall paintings from the first millennium have survived. The<ref type="cr">wall paintings in Syria and Lebanon</ref> deserve separate attention, with those of<ref type="cr">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>,<ref type="cr">Qara</ref>, and the Lebanese Qadisha Valley as unmistakable highlights. Most of these belong to the period between the 11th and 13th century. To the same period in all likelihood belongs a newly discovered wall painting in the church of Mar Gewargis in<ref type="cr">Qaraqosh</ref>, near Mosul, representing the Baptism of Jesus (Snelders 2007). The art of wall painting continued well into the modern area. Interesting 18th-cent. examples are found in the Syr. Orth. church of Sergius and Bacchus in Ṣadad, ca. 100 km. north east of Damascus (Brock and Taylor,<i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol. 2, 147–50).</p>
<p>In addition to the heartlands of Syr. Christianity, wall paintings reflecting Syriac Christianity may be found in<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in Egypt, which from the early 9th cent. onwards had a mixed Coptic and Syriac monastic population. While the earliest paintings in the main Church of the monastery predate the arrival of Syr. monks, some of the later paintings must reflect the interests and taste of the Syr. monks. This may be the case for the probably 10th-cent. painting of the Three Patriarchs (Innemée 1998), and even more so for the very fragmentarily preserved paintings of Emperor Constantine and King Abgar (holding the<i>mandylion</i>), both of which are accompanied by Syriac inscriptions and may also belong to the 10th  cent. (Innemée and Van Rompay). Fully preserved paintings in three half-domes of the church, with Syriac inscriptions, belong to the early 13th cent. (Leroy 1982).</p>
<label>5. Liturgical Vessels and Accessories</label>
<div type="body">
<p>A large number of 5th- or 6th-cent. liturgical objects from Syria have been uncovered in the course of the 20th cent., in the area south-west of Aleppo (Mundell Mango). In some cases inscriptions provide information on the date and on the church to which the objects belonged: Kaper Koraon (the exact location of which is uncertain) and Beth Misona (three chalices and a paten, now in the Cleveland Museum of Art). While the link with Syriac Christianity seems to be obvious, the inscriptions are in Greek, not in Syriac. A  rare Syriac inscribed silver dish from the 6th cent., in the collection of the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, has been made popular among Syr. scholars by R. Murray’s<i>Symbols of Church and Kingdom</i> (1975 and 2004). It represents the Ascension, the women at the tomb, and the Crucifixion, along with soldiers, Peter and the cock, and Daniel in the lions’ den.</p>
<p>To a slightly later period, perhaps 8th or 9th cent., belongs a very well preserved bronze incense burner uncovered in Takrit (now in the National Museum of Baghdad); it has nine scenes from the life of Jesus (Harrak 2006), but no inscriptions.</p>
<p>From the early 13th-cent. a bronze liturgical fan is preserved (<i>marwḥā</i> or<i>marwaḥtā</i>, ‘flabellum’), now housed in the Belgian Museum of Mariemont. The Syr. inscription reports that it was made in 1202/3 for Dayr al-Suryān in Egypt; it may have been produced in a workshop in the Mosul area (Snelders and Immerzeel). To the same period belongs the church treasure of Resafa, which includes a skillfully decorated silver chalice and a paten, both bearing inscriptions in Syriac (even though the objects may have been of Western origin or inspiration). The paten was a gift to the church of St. Sergius at Resafa by Ḥasnon of Edessa. These objects had probably been buried in order to be saved from the Mongol invasions of 1259/60 (Ulbert; Brock and Taylor,<i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol. 2, 212).</p>
<label>6. Liturgical Vestments</label>
<div type="body">
<p>While some information on liturgical vestments may be extracted from literary sources and from depictions in ms. illuminations and wall paintings, a rare piece, presently housed in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, has recently been studied: a bishop’s stole (<i>batrashil), bearing inscriptions in Syriac and Arabic. It was made for Bp.</i>Athanasius Abraham Yaghmur of Nabk in 1534–35 (Ball).</p>
<label>7. Syr. Christian Art in the 21st Century</label>
<div type="body">
<p>While the precious remains of ancient Syr. Christian art and architecture nowadays are receiving more attention from Syr. scholars and Syr. Christians alike, Syr. Christians at the same time are creating their own art forms, often inspired by the treasures of the past, to which they add new layers of interpretation and meaning according to their present-day situation. Churches are being renovated or new churches are being built in the Middle East, in India, and in the worldwide<ref type="cr">Diaspora</ref>. In many of these churches the ancient art of wall painting is brought to new life, while present-day liturgical publications often reflect the illuminated manuscripts of the past (for the Maronite tradition, see e.g. Badwi).</p>

</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Maronite polymath, Custodian of the Vatican Library, and titular bp. of Tyre. Born at Hasrun, he was educated from an early age at the Maronite College in Rome. From 1715–7 he travelled in the Middle East, collecting mss., including many from<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in the Nitrian Desert. In 1739 he was appointed First Custodian of the Vatican Library, a post he held until his death. It was on the basis of the Syriac mss., in large part from Dayr al-Suryān, that he compiled his monumental<i>Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino-Vaticana</i>, in four volumes (1719–28; repr. 1975, with ‘Postface’ by J.-M. Sauget; and 2002). This was effectively the first European history of Syriac literature, and it remains an important resource even today, thanks to the many extensive excerpts of Syriac texts. The volumes are arranged as follows: I, Orthodox (i.e. Chalcedonian) authors; II, Syrian Orthodox writers; III.1, literature of the Church of the East, and III.2, history of the Church of the East. (III.1, 3–362 contains an annotated edition of the verse catalogue of Syriac authors by<ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>). The three-volume Catalogue of the Hebrew and Syriac mss. in the Vatican Library was also compiled by him in conjunction with Stephanus Evodius (1756–9; the Syriac mss. are described in vols. 2–3). He was also the editor of the three volumes of Greek texts attributed to<ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> (1732, 1743, 1746; the three Syriac volumes were edited by<ref type="cr">P. Mubārak</ref>/Benedictus). A list of his extensive published literary output was drawn up by A. Mai, in<i>Scriptorum Veterum Nova Collectio III.2</i> (1828), 165–68; this includes the many works left unpublished, or unfinished at his death (he had planned several further volumes of the<i>Bibliotheca Orientalis</i>); some of these were published posthumously (e.g. his monograph on the Patriarchs of<ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, 1881), while others perished in a fire several months after his death. Ms. Vat. Syr. 389 is an autograph Syriac grammar (1707). He also played a central role in the Synod of Mount Lebanon (1736).</p>

<p>Scholar of the Christian East, professor at the University of Munich. Assfalg was born in Hohenaschau, Bavaria, on 6 Nov. 1919 and studied philosophy, theo­logy, and Near-Eastern languages (Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac) in Freising and Eichstätt. He served in the German army during World War II and became a prisoner of war in France. In 1946, he continued his studies at the University of Munich, where he specialized in the field of Eastern Christian studies, in particular under the guidance of W. Hengstenberg (philology of the Christian East) and A. Spitaler (Semitic languages). He earned his doctoral degree in 1950 with a dissertation on ‘The Order of the Priesthood’, an Arabic liturgical manual of the Coptic Church, and his ‘Habilitation’ in 1961 with an edition of the Old Georgian text of the Minor Prophets. Well-versed in all the languages of the Christian East, he taught at the University of Munich from 1963 and continued to do so, even after his official retirement in 1985. He died on 12 Jan. 2001 in Munich.</p>
<p>Among his Syriac publications, the catalogue of Syriac mss. in Germany (1963) should be singled out. Together with P. Krüger he co-edited the<i>Kleines Wörterbuch des Christlichen Orients</i> (1975), which was subsequently translated (with minor updates) into French (1991) and Polish (1998). His name is also closely associated with the journal<i>Oriens Christianus</i>, of which he was co-editor from 1965 until his death. For his 70th birthday, a<i>Festschrift</i> was presented to him (1979), which includes several contributions in the field of Syriac.</p>

<div type="body">
<p>In pre-modern sources, Assyrians (<i>Atorāye</i>) were inhabitants of the area or ecclesiastical province of Ator, around<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>. In modern times, however, the name has taken on two expanded senses: to denote 1. the whole ethnic group historically represented by the Ch. of E.; and sometimes 2. the supposed ethnic group represented by all the Syriac churches.</p>
<p>1. In medieval sources there are isolated references that connect Syr. Christians with the ancient Assyrians, but this identification was not developed until the 19th  cent. A. H. Layard identified the Christians he met as descendants of the ancient Assyrians whose buildings he was excavating (<i>Nineveh and its Remains</i>, vol. 2<i></i>[1848], 237). Since the area around Mosul had been called ‘Assyria’ from ancient times, this identification was not unnatural. It was a further development, however, when Anglicans (probably first G. P. Badger), seeking to avoid the word ‘Nestorian’, began to use the name ‘Assyrian Christians’ for the whole Church of the East. This usage was made official by the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission to the Assyrian Christians (1886) — although the missionaries did not use the word once they were in the field. The general adoption of ‘Assyrian’ and the Assyrian ethnology by the people themselves came after 1900 under the influence of nationalist writers like Freydon Atoraya. It was further encouraged when the founding of the present state of Syria made it more urgent to find an ethnic name other than ‘Syrian’. A  popular etymology had it that<i>Surāyā</i> (a variant of<i>Suryāyā</i>, ‘Syrian’) was a corruption of<i>Asurāyā</i> (even though correctly ‘Assyrian’ is<i>Atorāyā</i>). Whatever its background, the name ‘Assyrian’ has proved convenient and is now generally used even by those who do not accept the connection with ancient Assyria. The Church of the East, although it has not especially promoted this connection, is officially styled ‘Church of the East of the Assyrians’ or ‘Assyrian Church of the East’. Among Chaldean Catholics, ‘Assyrian’ has had to compete with ‘Chaldean’ as the preferred ethnic name. Some have adopted ‘Assyro-Chaldean’ as a compromise.</p>
<p>2. The name ‘Assyrian’ was already in use in some W.-Syr. circles before World War I. It was popularized in the USA by writers like<ref type="cr">Naʿʿūm Fāʾiq</ref>, and<ref type="cr">D. B. Perley</ref> who insisted that the different Syriac churches, eastern and western, were accidental divisions within a single nation. (From this period dates the adoption of ‘Assyrian’ into the names of some American Syr. Orth. parishes, who retain it today although without the accompanying nationalist agenda.) The Syr. Orth. hierarchy has generally opposed the name ‘Assyrian’, and writers within the Church emphasize its Aramean heritage over against any alleged Assyrian one.</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Athanasios I Gamolo</head>
<LemmaComment>(d. 631) 
<label type="affiliation">Syiac Orthodox</label><anchor/>
</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Long-serving Patr. of the Syr. Orth. Church in the late 6th and early 7th cent. His consecration is commonly dated to 594 or 595, but there is confusion in the ­sources as to the exact date: medieval and modern authors have also suggested 587, 597, and 603 as possibilities. All sources agree that Athanasios died in 631 and one gives 28 July as the precise day (<i>Chronica Minora</i>, vol. 2, ed. E. W. Brooks, p. 144).</p>
<p>Athanasios was ordained Patr. against his will. Afterwards, his bishops agreed to allow him to return to his monastery for a year to complete the task which had been assigned him there: tending camels. When the bishops came to collect Athanasios a year later, they found him working in a mud pit, helping to patch up a camel stable. This association with camels earned him the epithet<i>Gamolo</i> ‘Camel Driver.’</p>
<p>Athanasios’s patriarchate spanned a tumultuous period in the history of the Near East: the Byzantine-Persian wars of the early 7th cent. Most of Athanasios’s actions recorded in historical sources relate to his confronting the implications for the church of changing political orders; in the course of his service he dealt either directly or indirectly with both Byzantine and Persian rulers.</p>
<p>Athanasios is credited with reorganizing the structure of the Syr. Orth. Church in the Persian Empire. He appointed bishops there and gave<ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> primacy over all other monasteries in the Persian Empire.</p>
<p>In perhaps 629–30, Athanasios, along with twelve bishops, met with the Emperor Heraclius for twelve days in Mabbug and held theological discussions. When they ultimately refused to accept the Council of Chalcedon, Heraclius became enraged and unleashed a persecution on Miaphysites throughout the Empire.</p>
<p>In either 610 or 616, Athanasios and Anastasius, the Miaphysite Patr. of Alexandria, ended the Tritheist Schism which had divided the two churches since the late 6th-cent. dispute between Damian and<ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref>.</p>
<p>The ‘Conflict of Severus’ (PO 4 and PO 49.4), which exists in Coptic fragments as well as in Arabic and Ethiopic, is the only stand-alone work of Athanasios which survives. His other extant works are all to be found embedded in the Chronicle of<ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>. They include: a letter of Athanasios to Quryaqos of<ref type="cr">Amid</ref> (vol. 2, 381–94; vol. 4, 392–9); the synodicon established by Athanasios and Anastasios, Patr. of Alex­andria, ending the Tritheist schism (vol.  2, 381–93; vol. 4, 392–9); an encyclical of Athanasios to the bps. of the East (vol.  2, 394–9; vol. 4, 400–2); a<i>libellus</i> of Athanasios to Heraclius (vol. 2, 405–8; vol. 4, 404–8); and a letter to the Monks of Mor Matay (vol. 2, 414–7; vol.  4, 411–3).</p>
<p>After his death in 631, Athanasios was succeeded as Patr. by his synkellos,<ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of the Sedre</ref>.</p>

Athanasios studied under<ref type="cr">Severos Sebokht</ref> in the<ref type="cr">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref> and later was a monk at the Monastery of Beth Malka.

A single work by Athanasios from this time survives, a letter written against Christians who attend pagan feasts and eat the meat of pagan sacrifices. A later scribe added an incipit claiming that the letter refers to the sacrifices of Hagarenes. Athanasios died in September of 687 and was succeeded by Yulyanos Rumoyo.</p>
<p>Throughout his life Athanasios was an avid translator of Greek philosophical works and patristic authors. Several of his translations still survive. These include a translation of<ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s Isagoge that Athanasios completed in 645 (ms. Vat. Syr. 158), the translation of an anonymous Greek introduction to logic (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,660, ed.

<p>Scribe, minor author, and translator. He was born in<ref type="cr">Amid</ref> to ʿAbd al-Nūr and Narzkhan. Two of his brothers, Thoma and Yawseph, became priests. Athanasios became a monk at<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> ca. 1697 and was ordained priest before 1705. After he studied under Maph.<ref type="cr">Shemʿun II</ref>, Athanasios was consecrated in 1707 as assisting bp. for the patriarchate (in other accounts bp. of<ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>) and was given the honorific name Athanasios.

</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Bp. of Alexandria and Greek author. He became bp. of Alexandria in 328, but spent much of his life in exile due to his vigorous opposition to Arianism. Many of his numerous writings (in Greek) were translated into Syriac, and some of these survive in several recensions. Most of Athanasius’s works in Syriac are only known from early Syr. Orth. or Melkite mss. (in some cases there have been some dogmatic alterations).<ref type="cr">Timo­theos  I</ref>, however, in his Letters knew of several works, and the Letter to Epictetus is quoted in both E.- and W.-Syr. dogmatic florilegia. The only work transmitted in a large number of mss. is the Life of Antony, which was later incorporated into<ref type="cr">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>’s ‘Paradise of the Fathers’. The following are the most important translations which have so far been edited:</p>
<p>1. ‘On the Incarnation’ (<i>CPG</i> 2091), ed. with ET, R. W. Thomson,<i>Athanasiana Syriaca</i>, vol. 1 (CSCO 257–8; 1965). This represents the short recension of the Greek text.</p>
<p>2. ‘Life of Antony’ (<i>CPG</i> 2101), ed. with FT, R.  Draguet (CSCO 417–8; 1980); earlier editions by P.  Bedjan in<i>Acta Martyrum et Sanctorum</i>, vol. 5, and E. A. W. Budge in<i>Paradise of the Fathers</i> (1904). Dra­guet’s view that the very free translation represents a lost earlier form of the Greek text is now dis­counted.</p>
<p>3. ‘Exposition of the Psalms’ (<i>CPG</i> 2140), ed. with ET, Thomson,<i>Athanasiana Syriaca</i>, vol. 4 (CSCO 386–7; 1977). There is both a full and an abbreviated form.</p>
<p>4. ‘On Virginity’ (<i>CPG</i> 2145), ed. with FT, J. Lebon in<i>LM</i>40 (1927), 205–48; ET in Brakke 1995, 303–9. This is only known in Syriac and Armenian.</p>
<p>5. Homily on Matt. 12:32 (<i>CPG</i> 2096), ed. with ET, Thomson,<i>Athanasiana Syriaca</i>, vol. 2.</p>
<p>6. Letters:</p>
<p>a. Festal Letters (<i>CPG</i> 2102), ed. W. Cureton (1848); FT of the Syriac index in A.  Martin and M. Albert, in<i>SC</i> 317 (1985). IT and study in A. Camplani,<i>Atanasio di Alessandria, Lettere Festali; Anonimo, Indice delle Lettere Festale</i>(2003). The Syriac translation is particularly important since most of the Greek originals is lost.</p>
<p>b. The following letters have been edited, with ET, by Thomson: in<i>Athanasiana Syriaca</i>, vol. 1: to Epictetus (<i>CPG</i> 2095); in<i>Athanasiana Syriaca</i>, vol. 2: to Adelphius (<i>CPG</i> 2098), (Serapion [<i>CPG</i> 2096]), the Africans (<i>CPG</i> 2133), the Antiochenes (<i>CPG</i> 2134), Maximus (<i>CPG</i> 2100); in<i>Athanasiana Syriaca</i>, vol. 3: to Jovian (<i>CPG</i> 2253). The Letter to Epictetus was also published by P. Bedjan,<i>Nestorius, Le livre d’Héraclide</i> (1910), 577–96.</p>
<p>c. To the Virgins (<i>CPG</i> 2146), ed. with FT, J. Lebon, in<i>LM</i>41 (1928), 169–216. This is only found in Syriac. Unpublished Syriac translations include Against the Arians (<i>CPG</i> 2093), in ms. Damascus Patr. 12/24 (beginning and end lost; see S. P. Brock, in<i>LM</i>86 [1973], 437–42).</p>
<p>A number of writings claiming to be by Athanasius were put out under his name by Apollinarians; some of these were translated into Syriac and have been published: On the Incarnation of God the Word (<i>CPG</i> 3365), ed. with ET, Thomson,<i>Athanasiana Syriaca</i>, vol. 3; That Christ is one (<i>CPG</i> 3737), ed. with ET, Thomson,<i>Athanasiana Syriaca</i>, vol. 3. (These were also edited earlier by J. Flemming and H. Lietzmann, 1904).</p>
<p>Other texts wrongly ascribed in Syriac to Athanasius are:</p>
<p>1. ‘On the Cross and the Passion’ (<i>CPG</i> 2247), ed. with ET, Thomson,<i>Athanasiana Syriaca</i>, vol. 3.</p>
<p>2. ‘Against Apollinarius I’ (<i>CPG</i> 2231), ed. with ET, Thomson,<i>Athanasiana Syriaca</i>, vol. 3. Three recensions are known.</p>
<p>3. ‘On the Incarnation against the Arians’ (<i>CPG</i> 2806), ed. with ET, Thomson,<i>Athanasiana Syriaca</i>, vol.  3. This is now attributed to Marcellus of Ancyra.</p>
<p>4. Another treatise on Virginity, ed. with ET, D. Brakke (CSCO 592–3; 2002).</p>
<p>5. A baptismal address, ed. with ET, S. P. Brock in<i>OC</i> 61 (1977), 92–102.</p>

<p>Bp., lexicographer, and translator into Syriac. He was born in<ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref> of Qasha Hirmiz bar Michael who was the brother of Patr. Yawsep Audo. Audo’s brother Israel Audo became the bp. of<ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>. After completing his elementary studies in Alqosh, his uncle the patr. took him to Rome where Audo joined the college of Congregatio de Propaganda Fide from 1869 to 1880. He was ordained a priest in 1880 and returned to<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> where he served under his uncle’s successor Patr. Eliya ʿAbū al-Yūnan. He later served as patriarchal vicar to<ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> in 1882 for four years, after which he returned to Mosul to take charge of the<ref type="cr">Seminary of St. John</ref>. He was consecrated bp. of<ref type="cr">Urmia</ref> and Salamas in 1892, and participated in the Synod that elected Patr. ʿAbdishoʿ Khayyāṭ in 1894. During the persecutions that occurred during World War I, he protected and provided shelter to many refugees, only to become a victim himself when he was assassinated, along with other priests and parishioners, on 27 July 1918.</p>
<p>Audo produced a Syriac-Syriac lexicon entitled<i>Simta d-leššāna suryāyā</i> /<i>Dictionnaire de la langue chaldéenne</i>(2  vols.; Mosul, 1897–1901); a grammar of Swadaya (i.e. colloquial) Neo-Aramaic entitled<i>Gramaṭiqi d-leššānā swādāyā</i>  /<i>Grammaire de la langue chaldéenne moderne. Dialecte d-Ourmiah</i> (Urmia, 1905; 2nd  ed. 1911); and a liturgy for the feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, published by<ref type="cr">Bedjan</ref> in<i>Breviarium Chaldaicum</i>, vol. 3 (Paris, 1886–7). He translated the following works from Latin into Syriac: P. Scavini’s<i>Theologia moralis ad mentem S. Alphonsi M. de Ligorio (2 vols.; Urmia, 1899, 1900)</i>;<i>Catechismus Romanus ex decreto Concilii Tridentini</i> (The Catechism of the Council of Trent) (Mosul, 1889); Nieremberg’s<i>La Balance du Temps</i> (Mosul, date unknown); and Louis Togni’s<i>Instructio pro sacris Ecclesiae ministris</i> (French title<i>Instruction pour les ministres de L’Église</i>; Mosul, 1895). He also translated from Arabic into Syriac the fables of<ref type="cr">Kalila and Dimna</ref> (French title<i>Kalila et Dimna fables indiennes</i>; Mosul, 1895). He also revised a translation into Syriac, made by the Chald. monk<ref type="cr">Damyanos of Alqosh</ref> (d. 1858), of an Arabic version of Paolo Segneri’s<i>Manuale Sacerdotum</i> (Mosul, 1882; 2nd ed. 1893).</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Awgen, Mar</head>
<LemmaComment>(fl. 4th – early 5th cent.)<anchor/>
</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Mar Awgen is the traditional founder of monasticism in Mesopotamia. The two primary sources for his life are an anonymous ‘Life of Mar Awgen’ and a brief account preserved in the ‘Book of Chastity’, composed by<ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>of Baṣra (9th cent.). He receives an earlier mention in<ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref>, in the 7th cent. Mar Awgen was an Egyptian, born in the time of Constantine. He worked for twenty-five years as a pearl diver, but then left this occupation to join the nascent monastic movement, and he became a disciple of Pachomius, the famous Egyptian monastic leader. After spending some time in the monastery of Pachomius, Mar Awgen travelled to<ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> and founded a monastery on nearby Mt. Izla. His seventy disciples who followed him from Egypt were the reputed founders of other monasteries in various parts of Mesopotamia and other Syriac-speaking lands. Mar Awgen himself is said to have performed numerous miracles in the presence of Shapur, the King of Persia. It has also been reported that his remains and those of certain of his disciples were brought to the Monastery of Mar Ḥananya (<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>). Mar Awgen is held in the highest esteem in all the eastern churches with Syriac roots.</p>
<p>Scholars have now shown that this traditional account does not have a firm historical foundation and has served primarily to obfuscate the native origins of Syro-Mesopotamian monasticism in favor of reputed Egypt­ian origins. These accounts of Mar Awgen have been shown to be of late origin, anachronistic, and extremely divergent on important details, e.g. the number of his disciples ranges from eighteen to seventy, and a number of monks named in these accounts actually lived as late as the 7th and even 10th cent. Attempts to connect Mar Awgen to the Aōnes mentioned in Sozomen’s Ecclesiastical History (VI.33) have failed, and it is even possible, as some scholars have surmised, that there was, in fact, no such historical person as Mar Awgen.</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Babai the Great</head>
<LemmaComment>(ca. 551–628) 
<label type="affiliation">Church of the East</label><anchor/>
</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Theologian and monastic author. The main sources for Babai’s life are<ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>’s ‘Book of Chastity’ (chap.  39),<ref type="cr">Toma of Marga</ref>’s ‘Book of Superiors’ (I, ch. 27 and 29), and the Chronicle of<ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>(chap. 84). Born in Beth ʿAynatha (in Beth Zabdai), he studied at the<ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> under<ref type="cr">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref>. He subsequently became a monk of the ‘Great Monastery’, founded in 571 by<ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref> (d. 588). Later, he moved to Beth Zabdai to found his own monastery there, but in 604 he returned to the Great Monastery, where he had been appointed Abbot, in succession to Dadishoʿ. During the interregnum (609–28) following the death of the Cath.<ref type="cr">Grigor</ref>, the Ch. of E. was administered jointly by the Archdeacon and Babai, the latter having the title ‘Visitor of the monasteries’. He died shortly after the death of Khusrau II (628), who had not allowed the appointment of a successor to Grigor.</p>
<p>Babai’s writings cover four main topics:</p>
<p>1. Christology. His ‘Book of the Union, on the divinity and humanity (of Christ) and on the prosopon of the union’, remains a fundamental statement of the Christology of the Church to this day. It is composed in seven books, of which the seventh may originally have belonged to another work. The ‘Book of the Union’ was edited (with LT) by A. Vaschalde (CSCO 79–80; 1915); there is an unpublished ET by M. Birnie. In the same volume of the CSCO there is also a short treatise ‘Against those who say “Just as the body and soul are one<i>qnomā</i>, so too God the Word and the Man are one<i>qnomā</i>” ’. An excerpt arguing that ‘two natures’ (in the incarnate Christ) implies ‘two<i>qnome</i>’ features in a late collection of Christological texts (ed. with ET by L. Abramowski and A. Goodman,<i>Nestorian Christological Texts</i> [1972], vol. 1, 207–9 [Syr.], vol. 2, 123–5 [ET]).</p>
<p>2. Monastic topics. Of great significance, for its learning as well as for its length, is his Commentary on<ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>’s ‘Gnostic Chapters’ (ed. with GT by Frankenberg, 1912). Babai also wrote a Commentary on<ref type="cr">Mark the Monk</ref>’s ‘Spiritual Law’ (unpublished; study by G. Krüger, in<i>OC</i> 44 [1960], 46–74). A collection of short ‘Useful Counsels on the Ascetic Life’ are also unpublished, but there is an ET by G. Chediath,<i>Babai the Great. Some Useful Counsels on the Ascetic Life</i> (Moran Etho 15; 2001). Babai wrote a set of Rules for monks, preserved only in Arabic translation (ed. with ET,<ref type="cr">A. Vööbus</ref>,<i>Syriac and</i><i>Arabic Documents regarding Legislation relative to Syrian Asceticism</i> [1960], 176–84).</p>
<p>3. Hagiography. In his Life of Gewargis (ed.<ref type="cr">P. Bedjan</ref>,<i>Histoire de Mar Jabalaha, de trois autres patriarches, d’un prêtre et deux laiques, nestoriens</i> [1895; repr. 2007], 424–8) Babai gives a list of his hagiographical works, but of these only the Life of Mihramgushnasp/Gewargis (martyred in 615) survives in full (ed. Bedjan,<i>Histoire de Mar Jabalaha,</i>416–571; GT by G. Hoffmann, 1880). Unfortunately the only ms. of a woman martyr, Christina, breaks off soon after the beginning (ed. Bedjan,<i>Acta Martyrum et Sanctorum</i>, vol. 4, 201–7).</p>
<p>4. Liturgy. Two<i>tešbḥātā</i> (‘Our Father who is in heaven, holy is his nature...’ and ‘Blessed is the Compassionate One who in his grace...’) are specifically attributed to him (though some mss. have a different attribution); the first of these also features in the Maronite<i>Šḥimto</i> (Thurs.<i>Lilyo</i>). A Hymn for the Commemoration of the Greek Doctors is also attributed to him (ms. Cambridge Add. 1980, f. 210r; not found in T. Darmo’s edition of the<i>ḥudrā</i>).</p>
<p>5. Parts of a work on the monastic life are preserved in a ms. (M20N) of the ‘New Finds’ at the<ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref>, Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>A large number of other works by Babai have not survived (<ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> states that he wrote ‘83 volumes’ in all).</p>

<div type="body">
<p>City on the Tigris, approximately 35 km. north of<ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>. The seat of the Ch. of E. Cath. under the Abbasids and the seat today of the Chald. Patr. and Ancient Ch. of E. Patr. ‘Baghdad’, whose etymology is disputed, was originally the name of one of the villages that stood on the site of the city founded by the second Abbasid caliph al-Manṣūr under the name of Madīnat al-Salām ‘City of Peace’ in 762. Later Syriac authors often call the city ‘Babel’, i.e. Babylon. From 762 until 1258, when it was taken by Hulagu (except in 836–92, when the caliphs resided in Sāmarrāʾ), Baghdad was the seat of the Abbasid caliphate, and in the first half of that period was among the most prosperous and culturally advanced cities in the world. Capital of a province corresponding largely to the central part of today’s Iraq under the Ottomans (1534–1623, 1638–1918), Baghdad became the capital of the newly formed state of Iraq in 1921.</p>
<p>The first Ch. of E. Cath. to spend time in Baghdad was Yaʿqob II (753–73), namely in a prison there, an experience shared by the Syr. Orth. Patr.<ref type="cr">Giwargis</ref> I (759–90) and the Melk. Patr. Theodoros (751–97). Cath.<ref type="cr">Ḥenanisho</ref>ʿ<ref type="cr">II</ref> (773–80), though elected in the Monastery of Mar Petion in Baghdad, continued to reside in Seleucia-Ctesiphon. With<ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> (780–823) the Catholicoi begin to reside permanently in Baghdad. Major groups of Christians who settled in the city came from earlier E. Syr. centers at<ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref>, Kashkar (al-Wāsiṭ), and<ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>. W.-Syr. Christians also had a significant presence in Baghdad by the end of the 8th cent. Beginning with Timotheos I himself, in the period down to the middle of the 11th cent., Syr. Christian scholars played a vital role in the intellectual life of Baghdad, especially as physicians and as translators of Greek philosophical and scientific works into Arabic — scholars such as<ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873), Abū Bishr Mattā b. Yūnus (d. 940),<ref type="cr">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (893–974), and<ref type="cr">Abū al-Faraj ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043), to name but a few (see<ref type="cr">medicine</ref> and<ref type="cr">Greek, Syriac translations from</ref>). Though not subject to official persecutions as occurred earlier under the Sasanians, the Christians in Baghdad were subject to certain discriminations and were vulnerable to attacks by the populace, especially at times of instability under weak governments, which was often the case from the middle of the 10th cent. onwards.</p>
<p>The residences of the Catholicoi generally followed the movement of the political and commercial center of the city. In the first period, they resided on the right bank of the Tigris, in the Monastery of Klil Ishoʿ (also called Dayr al-Jāthalīq ‘Monastery of the Catholicos’) to the south of the ‘Round City’, where most of the Catholicoi from Timotheos I to Sargis I (860–72) were buried, and in the Monastery of Mar Petion (Dayr al-ʿAtīqa) in the former village of Sūrāyā (al-ʿAtīqa) to the east of the Round City, which predated the foundation of Madīnat al-Salām and was restored by Sabrishoʿ II (831–35). Yoḥannan II (884–91) was the first Catholicos to establish his residence on the left bank, in the Shammāsiyya Quarter in the northern part of the walled city of that period. Most of the Catholicoi from Yoḥannan III (893–899) to Eliya II (1111–32) resided there and were buried in the ‘Palace of the Greeks’ (Dār al-Rūm). Barṣawma  I (1134–36) moved his residence south to the Church of Mar Sabrishoʿ in Sūq al-Thalātha, and Yahbalaha II (1190–1222) to the Church of St. Mary in the Karkh Quarter on the west bank. After the fall of Baghdad to the initially pro-Christian Mongols, Makkika  II (1257–65) was given a group of buildings centered around the mansion of a former vizier on the Tigris as his residence, but his successor Denḥa I (1265–81) was forced to withdraw to<ref type="cr">Arbela</ref> by Muslim reactions against Mongol rule in the city.<ref type="cr">Yahbalaha III</ref> (1281–1317),<ref type="cr">Timotheos II</ref> (1318–32) and, probably, Denḥa II (mid-14th cent.) were still consecrated in Baghdad, but normally resided away from Baghdad in northern Iraq and (today’s Iranian) Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Ḥabib, the first known Syr. Orth. bp. of Baghdad, is attested in 818. Among the churches belonging to the Syr. Orth. community in Baghdad was that of Mār Tūmā, the burial place of Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī, in the Christian quarter (Qaṭīʿat al-Naṣārā) to the south of the Round City. Ch. of E. Cath. Yoḥannan V (1000–11) succeeded in obtaining a decree from the caliph forbidding the long-term residence of Syr. Orth. maphrians in Baghdad during a visit to the city by Maph. Ignatius bar Qiqi (991–1016) in 1003/4. Nevertheless,<ref type="cr">Yuḥanon bar Maʿdani</ref> (Maphr. 1232–53, Patr. 1253–63) was later able to spend several years of his maphrianate in Baghdad, devoting part of that time to the study of Arabic literature. The last pre-modern Syr. Orth. bp. of Baghdad was Timotheos Yeshuʿ, ordained there by<ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> in 1265.</p>
<p>Little is heard of the Christians in Baghdad after the sack of the city by Timur in 1401, and it is only in the 17th cent. that we have evidence again of the presence of Christians in any significant numbers. From the middle of the 19th cent., the Chald. patriarchs (bearing the title ‘of Babylon’), though normally resident in<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, often visited Baghdad. Two of them, Yoḥannan  VIII Hormizd (1830–38) and ʿAbdishoʿ V Khayyāṭ (1895–99), died and were buried in Baghdad. The Chald. patriarchate was transferred from Mosul to Baghdad de facto under Yawsep VII Ghanīma (1947–58) and officially under Pawlos   II Cheikho (1958–89). The Ch. of E. Patr. Shemʿon XX Pawlos (1918–20), who died as a refugee in Baʿqūba, was interred in Baghdad. The Ch. of E. has had a bishop in Baghdad since 1951. Baghdad has been the seat of the patriarchs of the Ancient Church of the East since 1968, when<ref type="cr">Toma Darmo</ref> (d.  1969) was elected patriarch there by those opposed to the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in the Ch. of E. The Syr. Catholic Church has had a bp. resident in Baghdad since 1862. The new Syr. Orth. see of Baghdad and Baṣra was erected in 1960, and has had the scholar Būlus Behnām (metr. 1962–69) and the future patriarch Severus (later Ignatius) Zakkā ʿIwāṣ (metr. 1969–80, Patr. 1980–) as its occupants.</p>
<p>There are around fifty churches of various denominations in the city today (including 24 Chald., 7 Syr. Orth., 4 Ch. of E., 3 Syr. Catholic, and 2 Ancient Ch. of E. in regular use, according to S. Rassam,<i>Christianity in Iraq</i>, 2005). The oldest is that of Virgin Mary on al-Maydān Square near the northern end of the Ottoman city area, built in 1639 and now in Armenian Orthodox hands. A number of churches were founded in the 19th  cent. in the area that came to be called ʿAqd al-Naṣārā nearer the center of the old city, including the Chald. Church of Mary Mother of Sorrows (Umm al-Aḥzān; place of burial of Patr. Yoḥannan VIII, ʿAbdishoʿ V, and Pawlos II) and the former Syr. Cath. cathedral, as well as the Latin church now used by the Coptic Orthodox. Many of the newer representative churches are found in the area to the southeast of the city center, including the new Syr. Cath. Cathedral of Our Lady of Deliverance/Sayyidat al-Najāt (1968, commonly called Umm al-Ṭāq) and the Chald. Church of St. Joseph (Kharbanda, 1956; place of burial of Patr. Yawsep VII) in the eastern part of al-Karrāda. The Syr. Orth. cathedral (Sts. Peter and Paul, 1964) is located further east near the University of Technology, and the Ancient Church of the East cathedral (Virgin Mary, 1988) further southeast in Ḥayy al-Riyāḍ. Another important Christian area of the city is al-Dawra to the south of the large bend of the Tigris, including the ‘Assyrian Quarter’ (Ḥayy al-Āthūriyyīn) in its southern part and Ḥayy al-Mīkānīk further south with the Ch.  of E. Church of Mar Zaya (built to replace the former Cathedral of Mar Zaya in Karrādat Maryam which was demolished by the government in 1985) and the Pontifical Babel College for Philosophy and Theology (founded in 1991, temporarily transferred to ʿAynkawa near Arbela in 2007). Many of the churches in Baghdad have been the targets of terrorist attacks in the period of instability since 2003.</p>
<p>The Syriac Corporation of the Iraqi Academy of Science, originally founded as the Syriac Academy in 1975, has played an important role in the promotion of the academic study of Syriac. A Department of Syriac Language was established at the University of Baghdad in 2004. The troubles since 2003 have had adverse effects on the state of Syriac and Christian Arabic mss. in Baghdad, including those in major collections, such as those of the Chald. Monastery of St. Antony (collection formerly at the Monastery of Our Lady of the Seeds at<ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref>), the Chald. Patriarchate (incorporating collections from elsewhere in Iraq) and the Ch. of E. Archbishopric, as well as those in other ecclesiastical, public and private collections.</p>

<div type="body">
<p>Bahdeidat is 12 km. northeast of Jbeil (Giblet or Byblos), 47 km. from<ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>, 550 m. above sea level. The small church of Mar Tadros, which is nowadays Maronite, is built as a single barrel-vaulted nave with a wide, protruding porch open at the west end. It measures ca. 13x8 m. without the porch.</p>
<p>The east end is covered with a coherent program of wall paintings spilling over to the northern and southern walls of the nave. In the semi-dome is the Enthroned Christ in Majesty, with the Cherubim and Seraphim on either side, waving standards that give the words of the Trisagion. Behind the throne are the four beasts of the Apocalypse, the man (Matthew), the lion (Mark), the bull (Luke) and the eagle (John). Behind these are the standing figures of Mary and John the Baptist, their hands held out in supplication. The twelve apostles stand below this Vision, with the prophet Daniel at the northern end of the row and St. Stephen on the south.</p>
<p>The triumphal arch shows the Christ Emmanuel, between the Sacrifice of Isaac on the north and Moses Receiving the Tablets of the Law on the south. Below them are Mary and Gabriel of the Annunciation.</p>
<p>On the nave walls, on either side of the apse, is the equestrian knight St. Theodore spearing a dragon and the riding St. George, bearing the small water-carrier behind him. Both the equestrian knights are shown with donor portraits beneath the horses.</p>
<p>All the wall paintings are inscribed in a mixture of Serṭo and Esṭrangela.</p>
<p>These wall paintings represent the only comprehensive series of paintings executed by one workshop to have survived in Lebanon. In style they closely resemble the paintings of a church in the nearby village of<ref type="cr">Maʿad</ref>. According to a ms. in Dayr al-Shife, not far from Bahdeidat, a Syr. Orth. priest called Naʿman was ordained in Bahdeidat in 1256. This 13th-cent. date accords with the style of the paintings in both Bahdeidat and Maʿad and they belong to the Syr. Orth. tradition of painting, like the paintings of<ref type="cr">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>. At some point after the 13th cent. the church would have passed from the Syr. Orth. to the Maronites.</p>

<div type="body">
<p>Balad, Assyrian Balaṭ, Syriac and Arabic Balad or Balaṭ, and modern Aski Mosul (Turkish for ‘Old Mosul’) are names referring to a town located some 40 km. northwest of<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, on the west bank of the Tigris. Balad occurs in the inscriptions of the Assyrian king Sennacherib (BC 705–681), and in Syriac sources as part of the province of<ref type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>. In the late 5th cent. it became an E.-Syr. bishopric seat, beginning with bps Ḥawaḥ and Shubḥa l-Ishoʿ, who were present at the synod of Mar Babai that took place in<ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> in 497. The long line of E.-Syr. bps. ended around 1364 with Aaron. Balad was also a Syr. Orth. bishopric seat, but only one bp., Mushe (mid 9th cent.), bore the title ‘bp. of Balad’. The other bishops may have resided in Dayr al-Muʿallaq ‘Hanging Monastery’, located some 15 km. from the city, on Mt. Buṭmān. They bore the title ‘bp. of Beth ʿArbaye’, having under their jurisdiction Sinjār and<ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, in addition to Balad. The last bp. was called ‘of Sinjār’ and served in this rank between 1317 and 1345, a fact that led Patr.<ref type="cr">Afram Barsoum</ref> to date the final destruction of Balad to the 14th cent.

<LemmaComment>ʿĪsā b. ʿAlī, Yashūʿ b. ʿAlī (second half of the 9th cent.) 
<label type="affiliation">Church of the East</label></LemmaComment><anchor/>
<div type="body">
<p>Physician, scribe, and author of a Syriac-Arabic Lexicon. In spite of some confusion in the scholarly literature (see Butts), Ishoʿ bar ʿAli can in all likelihood be identified with ʿĪsā b. ʿAlī, student of the well-known translator<ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873). From Arabic sources, it is known that he was the personal physician of Caliph al-Muʿtamid (r. 870–892), and that he authored two works (in Arabic) in the field of medicine, the ‘Book of the benefits made use of from the organs of animals’ and the ‘Book of poisons’. In addition, he is mentioned as a scribe in the colophon of two mss. of the Arabic Diatessaron (Vatican, Borg. Arab. 250; Oxford, Bodleian Arab. e 163).</p>
<p>Bar ʿAli is, however, best known for his Syriac-Arabic Lexicon (ed. Hoffmann [<i>ʾālap</i>through<i>mim</i>]; Gottheil [<i>nun</i> through<i>taw</i>]). In the preface to his Lexicon, Bar ʿAli states that he undertook its writing at the behest of a certain deacon Abraham. During his readings, Abraham had been employing the Lexicon of Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq as well as a Lexicon compiled by<ref type="cr">Ishoʿ of Merv</ref>. Abraham seems to have been happy with the former, but less so with the latter. In addition, according to Abraham, the lexicon of Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq and that of Ishoʿ of Merv differed at times in their definitions. Thus, Bar ʿAli undertook composing a new lexicon on the basis of these two previous works and supplemented by his own readings. At the end of the Preface, Bar ʿAli exhorts his future readers to expand and supplement his Lexicon with additional words. The name of one such expander is known from a postscript found in some mss., and it is none other than the aforementioned deacon Abraham.</p>
<p>The Lexicon of Bar ʿAli is an important source for Syriac lexicography. Already in the 1830s, the Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer F. H. W. Gesenius pointed out the significance of Bar ʿAli’s Lexicon for Semitic studies. In addition, the Lexicon of Bar ʿAli — along with that of<ref type="cr">Ḥasan Bar Bahlul</ref> (mid-10th cent.) — was incorporated into R. Payne Smith’s<i>Thesaurus Syriacus</i>and, to a lesser extent, C. Brockelmann’s<i>Lexicon Syriacum</i>.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that Bar ʿAli is to be distinguished from two other individuals with similar names: 1. ʿĪsā b. ʿAlī, who was the son of the ‘good vizier’ ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā b. Dāʾūd b. al-Jarrāḥ (d. 946), who was a student of<ref type="cr">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (d. 974), and who died in 1001 (see J. L. Kraemer,<i>Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam. The cultural revival during the Buyid age</i> [1986], 134–36); 2. ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā al-kaḥḥāl, who authored the ‘Prescription of Oculists’<i></i>(<i>tadhkirat al-kaḥḥālīn</i>), who was a student of<ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043), and who died sometime after 1010 (see E. Mittwoch, in<i>EI</i><sup>2</sup>, vol. 1, 388).</p>

<p>Scholar and lexicographer. Born in Awāna, ca. 60 km. north of<ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>, in the region of Ṭirhan, Bar Bahlul spent most of his life in Baghdad and belonged to the Christian intellectual elite, who interacted with Muslim scholars and were thoroughly bilingual. Bar Bahlul used both Syriac and Arabic in his publications. He was involved in the election of Cath. ʿAbdishoʿ I in 963.</p>
<p>Bar Bahlul’s Lexicon (Syr.<i>Leksiqon</i>) deals with scholarly and technical terminology and includes both Syriac words and Greek words in Syriac transliteration. The explanations are primarily in Syriac, but mostly contain equivalents and/or short comments in Arabic. Common Syriac words are normally not included. The words are taken from the Bible as well as from theological, philosophical, and scientific writings; a number of proper names are included as well. The words are in alphabetical order, even though Bar Bahlul occasionally groups together Syriac words that are based on the same root. The Lexicon brings the Syriac tradition of lexico­graphy to full fruition. In composing it, Bar Bahlul heavily relied on two works by<ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873) — a work on homographs and a no longer extant lexicon proper (<i>puššāq šmāhe</i>) — as well as on a no longer extant lexicon by<ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ bar Seroshway</ref> (ca. 900).</p>
<p>By way of these main sources and through personal reading Bar Bahlul included in his work words culled from many different authors and texts of Greek, Syriac, and Arabic origin. Some Syr. Orth. authors are occasionally quoted as well, such as<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>,<ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, and<ref type="cr">Mushe bar Kipho</ref>, along with a few non-Christian works, such as the Proverbs of the<ref type="cr">Arameans</ref> (<i>matle d-Ārāmāye</i>) — a title that reminds one of the<ref type="cr">Aḥiqar</ref> proverbs — and<ref type="cr">Kalila and Dimna</ref>. Bar Bahlul also provides rare information on dialectal variation within the Syriac language of his day, referring, among others, to the languages of<ref type="cr">Beth Aramaye</ref>,<ref type="cr">Beth Qaṭraye</ref>,<ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>,<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> (Atur), Gazarta,<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, and<ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>. Several words, expressions, names, and titles of works are known to us only through Bar Bahlul’s Lexicon, which has rightly been called a ‘linguistic and cultural encyclopedia’ (Ḥabbi). Preserved in both E.- and W.-Syr. mss., much of the information of the ‘Lexicon’ was incorporated in the modern dictionaries of R. Payne Smith and, to a lesser extent, of C. Brockelmann.</p>
<p>Another work by Bar Bahlul became known only a few decades ago. His ‘Book of signs’ (<i>Kitāb al-dalāʾil</i>), written in Arabic between 942 and 968, has the same encyclopedic breadth as the Lexicon. Probably intended as a manual for travelers, it deals with issues of calendar and, among other things, lists the festivals and commemorative days of Christians, Muslims (arranged according to the lunar months), Jews, Armenians, Copts, the people of Ḥarran, and the Sabians. Of particular importance is Bar Bahlul’s insider information on the feasts of the Ch. of E. Toward the end, the scope of this work broadens; a final section on dream interpretation has been identified as a summary rewriting of the dream manual written by the Muslim author Ibn Qutayba (d. 889).</p>

<p>Maph. (since 1264) and polymath. Foremost representative of the<ref type="cr">Syriac Renaissance</ref> of the 12th–13th cent. Bar ʿEbroyo was born as a son of the physician Ahrun in<ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>. The view that links his name to a Jewish ancestry is best rejected in favor of one associating it with the village of ʿEbro on the Euphrates downstream of Melitene. After periods of study in<ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, Tripoli (both then still in the hands of the Crusaders) and, possibly,<ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>, Bar ʿEbroyo was made bp. in 1246 of Gubos and a little later of Laqabin (both sees in the vicinity of Melitene) by Patr. Ignatius III Dawid<ref type="cr"></ref>(Maphr. 1215–22, Patr. 1222–52). In the schism that followed the death of Ignatius III, Bar ʿEbroyo sided at first with Dionysios ʿAngur<ref type="cr"></ref>(Patr. 1252–61) and was appointed by him in ca. 1253 to the see of<ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>, where he was to witness the fall of the city to the Mongols in 1260. The synod held in Cilicia following the death of Patr.<ref type="cr">Yuḥanon bar Maʿdani</ref> in 1264 saw the double election of Ignatius IV Yeshuʿ (Patr. 1264–82) to the patriarchate and of Bar ʿEbroyo to the maphrianate. Bar ʿEbroyo’s normal place of residence as maph. was<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> and the nearby<ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>, but a significant part of his maphrianate was spent in Maragha and Tabriz, the new centers of power and learning under the Mongol Īl-Khāns, where Bar ʿEbroyo befriended the leading Muslim scholars of the day. During his maphrianate Bar ʿEbroyo ordained a total of twelve bishops, including his biographer<ref type="cr">Diosqoros of Gozarto</ref>, and saw his erstwhile disciple Philoxenos Nemrod<ref type="cr"></ref>(Patr. 1283–92) elected to the patriarchate in 1283. He also entertained a friendly relationship with his Ch. of E. counterparts Denḥa I (Cath. 1265–81) and<ref type="cr">Yahbalaha III</ref>. Bar ʿEbroyo died in Maragha on 29/30 July 1286. His remains were later transferred to Dayro d-Mor Matay, where they rest to this day together with those of his younger brother and successor in the maphrianate,<ref type="cr">Grigorios Barṣawmo Ṣafī</ref>.</p>
<p>Bar ʿEbroyo composed over forty works covering a wide range of subjects, mostly in Syriac, but occasionally also in Arabic. Taken as a whole, Bar ʿEbroyo’s literary output may be seen as an attempt at a revival of learning in Syriac through the use of the latest scholarly literature which was available in his day mostly in Arabic. Bar ʿEbroyo frequently modelled his works on works of Arabic and Persian authors (e.g. Ibn Sīnā, Ghazālī, Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī) and incorporated into the framework provided by these models materials taken from both Arabo-Persian and Syriac sources, thus making a new synthesis out of the older Syriac and more recent Arabo-Persian literature. Bar ʿEbroyo has often been characterised as a skillful but unoriginal compiler of earlier works. This is a characterization that overlooks the originality to be found in his choice of sources and in his openness to the knowledge found in the works of Islamic scholars and those of other Christian denominations. His works were to remain for a long time the standard texts in many fields not only among the Christians of the W.-Syr. tradition but also among those of the E.-Syr. and Maron. traditions. Many of his works were later translated into Arabic, most notably by<ref type="cr">Daniel of Mardin</ref> (1326/7 – after 1382) and Grigorios Yūḥannā b. al-Ghurayr al-Zurbābī<ref type="cr"></ref>(Bp. of Damascus 1668–84).</p>

<p>Disciple of<ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref>; monastic leader. Bar ʿEdta is credited with the foundation of an important monastery, probably in 561 (or 571). The location of this monastery, which traditionally was assumed to be to the north of the village of Tarjilla, ca. 6 km. east/northeast of<ref type="cr">Karamlish</ref> (near<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>), was questioned by Fiey, who argued instead for a location in the district of Marga, near the river Khāzir. This monastery is said to have had as many as 400 monks. Bar ʿEdta’s life is known ­primarily through a metrical composition by Abraham Zabaya (from the region near the river Zab), who wrote at the request of the metropolitan Bp. ʿAbdishoʿ (who might have been<ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</ref>, even though it cannot be ruled out that we are dealing with an 11th-cent. namesake). Abraham mentions as his main source a prose narrative by Bar ʿEdta’s disciple Yoḥannan the Persian. Bar ʿEdta also features prominently in<ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>’s ‘Book of chastity’ and is discussed both in<ref type="cr">Toma of Marga</ref>’s ‘Book of governors’ and in the Chronicle of<ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>. Among Bar ʿEdta’s many disciples was Rabban Hormizd. Bar ʿEdta thus played an important role in the transmission of E.-Syr. monastic ideals.</p>

<div type="entry"><head>Bardaiṣan</head>
<LemmaComment>(154–222)<anchor/>
</LemmaComment><div type="body">
<p>Earliest known Syriac author. He was active at the court of Abgar VIII (177–212) in<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, where the chronicler Julius Africanus met him in 195 (<i>Kestoi</i> I.20), and recorded his skill at archery. Bardaiṣan’s name derives from that of the river Daiṣan (Greek<i>Skirtos</i> ‘Leaper’) which in his day flowed through Edessa. His own writings, which included works against<ref type="cr">Marcion</ref> and the Chaldeans (that is, astrologers), are unfortunately lost, since his views on cosmology were later considered unorthodox. What survives is a philosophical dialogue on fate and freewill in which Bardaiṣan is the protagonist; this work, probably by his pupil Philip, is generally known as the ‘Book of the Laws of the Countries’, due to a section on ethnography (whose accuracy in the passage on Ḥaṭra is now confirmed by a Ḥaṭran inscription, no. 281). The work was translated into Greek, and quotations from it are given in<ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref>’s ‘<i>Preparation for the Gospel</i>’ (VI.10.1–48) and the ‘Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions’ (IX.19–29). His teaching, some of which was conveyed in verse as well as in prose, has to be reconstructed from later hostile sources (above all,<ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>); it was evidently syncretistic in character, with elements drawn from Greek philosophy and Iranian and Gnostic cosmology; it may have served<ref type="cr">Mani</ref> as a partial model. The teaching on freewill in the ‘Book of the Laws of the Countries’ has been shown to be largely dependent on Alexander of Aphrodisias.</p>
