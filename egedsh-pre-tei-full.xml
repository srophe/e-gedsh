<LemmaTitle>Aba I</LemmaTitle> (d. 552) [Ch. of E.]
<p>Teacher of biblical interpretation, author, Cath. (540–52). Born from Zoroastrian parents, Aba converted to Christianity and studied at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>. He traveled to the Roman Empire and visited <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (where he was taught Greek, probably by his later disciple <ref type="cr">Toma of Edessa</ref>), Palestine, Egypt, and Constantinople. Upon his return, he became a teacher of biblical interpretation (<i>mpaššqānā</i>) at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> and subsequently at the School of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, which he is said to have founded. Following the death of Cath. Pawlos, he was elected as his successor in 540. In 544 an itinerant synod was held, during which Aba, accompanied by a changing number of bishops, visited several dioceses, many of which still suffered from the division in the church that had existed prior to the short tenure of Cath. Pawlos. The <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref> has preserved the following documents, which are related to this ecclesiastical visitation and, more broadly, to Aba’s reforms: 1. on reform of church governance; 2. on the orthodox faith; 3. on the <i>politeia</i> of correct behavior (focusing on Christian marriage and rejecting various kinds of illicit unions); 4. on the deposal of the initiators of division and schism; 5. on the various degrees in the ecclesiastical hierarchy; 6. a letter entitled <i>Practica</i> (fragments); 
7. canons (1–40; incomplete). Aba came into conflict with the Persian authorities and spent several of his years as Cath. in prison and in exile.</p>
<p>The sources attribute to Aba several commentaries on OT and NT books, of which only fragments exist in later works, such as the commentaries of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>. During his travels, around 530, he served as the instructor in biblical matters to the Egyptian author Cosmas Indicopleustes, who ca.  550 wrote his ‘Christian Topography’. Cosmas (in Book II.2) acknowledges Aba, whom he calls Patrikios (derived from the Greek word for ‘father’), as his source and is aware of Aba’s later election as Cath. in Persia. Interested in the Greek originals of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>’s and <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>’s works, Aba may have gathered around him a team of translators. One of these may have been the Syriac translator of Nestorius’s ‘Book of Heraclides’, who dedicated his work to Aba. A comment in the Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref> led Baumstark to suggest that Aba may have authored a Syriac translation of the Greek OT, but this cannot be substantiated.</p>
<p>In addition to a number of Syriac and Arabic sources providing details of Aba’s life, there is an important Syriac Life (published by Bedjan), which presents itself as the work of one of Aba’s disciples. Two of Aba’s other disciples, <ref type="cr">Qiyore of Edessa</ref> and Toma of Edessa (who died in Constantinople around 543), are known through their own writings.</p>

<Author>L.  Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Aba II of Kashkar</head><ab type="infobox"/>(641–751) [Ch. of E.]
<p>Scholar, Bp. of Kashkar, and Cath. (741–751). Born in (the vicinity of) Kashkar in 641 as son of Brik Ṣebyaneh (‘Blessed be His Will’). He received his education in the School of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> and was for a certain time Bp. of Kashkar before his election as Cath. in 741. In the sixth year of his Catholicate a conflict between Aba and the clergy of Seleucia-Ctesiphon arose; the latter accused the Cath. of having illegally taken the possessions of the city’s School. According to a letter written by Aba to the director, the teachers, and the other ‘brothers’ of the School, these charges were brought against him while he stayed outside the patriarchal seat for some time (probably for reasons of health). According to some medieval sources the Cath. retired in a monastery of al-Wāsiṭ for a year, but returned to Seleucia-Ctesiphon after the conflict was settled. Aba is known as the author of different works which, except for ‘the Letter to the leaders of the School’, are lost: the Book of the Governors (<i>Ktābā 
d-</i><i>esṭraṭige</i>), a Commentary on the Theologian (<ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>), a Commentary on some works concerning dialectics (probably some books of the ‘Organon’ of <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>), a Homily on the Martyr Zakhe, and Exegetical Homilies (<i>Memre puššāqāye</i>). From the latter many fragments and extracts have been preserved i<ab type="infobox"/>n the <ref type="cr">Gannat Bussāme</ref><ab type="infobox"/>, containing the exegesis of passages from Gen., Num., Isa., and the four Gospels. These fragments and extracts are of great importance for the cultural and intellectual history of the Ch. of E. for at least three reasons: 1.  they represent the genre of exegetical prose homilies in a style which shows a strong influence from and a very sophisticated use of Greek rhetoric; 
2. they show a very dynamic and varied exegetical tradition, in which not only influences from the works of <ref type="cr">Theo­dore of Mopsuestia</ref> but also from the works of <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref> and from the ancient tradition of the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref> become noticeable; 3. they present interesting early examples of apologetic and polemic dispute in response to Islamic criticism of Christian tenets such as the Trinity and the Divinity of Christ. Although Aba is reported to have maintained as Cath. good relations with the Muslim governor of Iraq, Yūsuf b. ʿUmar al-Thaqafī, his homilies testify that he took a fierce polemical stand against the anti-Christian proclamations that the Arab authorities propagated in his days.</p>

<p>Disciple of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, author, and biblical commentator. The ‘Testament of Ephrem’ mentions Aba as the first of Ephrem’s seven disciples. He must, therefore, be the same person as ‘Mar Aba, the disciple of Ephrem’ to whom several fragments are attributed in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,194, a 9th-cent. W.-Syr. collection of extracts from exegetical and theological works. These fragments, published by Nau, are taken from a Commentary on the Gospel (3 fragments), a Psalm Commentary (one fragment), and a <i>memrā</i> on Job the (OT) athlete (one fragment). To these meager remains some new texts may perhaps be added.</p>
<p>Aba is explicitly quoted in a work on the Holy Chrism by <ref type="cr">Anṭun of Tagrit</ref>, which exists in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,726 (f. 72r–85r) and remains unpublished.</p>
<p>In 1975, Beck published a long extract (240 lines of 7 syllables each) from a poem attributed to ‘Mar Aba, the disciple of the holy Mar Ephrem’ from ms. Sin. Syr. 67 (9th cent.). It deals with God’s immeasurable power and mercy.</p>
<p>In 1980, Reinink drew attention to forty fragments preserved in the <ref type="cr">Gannat Bussāme</ref> and quoted under Ephrem’s name. While other fragments bearing Ephrem’s name in the same work can be located in Ephrem’s Commentary on the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref>, these forty fragments do not belong to that work. Similarities with the previously identified Aba fragments suggest Aba’s authorship. These unpublished fragments show the author’s familiarity with the Diatessaron, even though he also knew the four separate Gospels.</p>
<p>More recently, among the <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> mss. a long ascetic text has come to light under the title ‘<i>Memrā</i> on faith’ (<i>haymānutā</i>). In two marginal notes the work is identified as ‘Book of the mind’ (<i>Ktābā d-reʿyānā</i>) and is explicitly attributed to ‘Mar Aba, the disciple of Mar Ephrem’. Possible connections come to mind with a <i>Ktābā d-reʿyāne</i> (plur.), translated by W.  Wright as ‘Book of sentences’, which is attributed to Ephrem and extracts of which exist in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,167, f. 293v. It cannot be ruled out that we are dealing here with an example of the entanglement between the literary heritage of the master and the disciple. If that is the case, future research hopefully will be able to delineate the disciple’s contribution and to bring him out of his master’s shadow.</p>

<LemmaTitle>ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</head><ab type="infobox"/>(fl. first quarter of 9th cent.) [Ch. of E] 
<p>Logician, theologian, legal scholar, translator, and metropolitan, first of <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>, and later of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> and Ḥazza. The name ‘Bahrīz’ reveals his Persian descent. Ḥabīb was probably his given name and ʿAbdishoʿ his ecclesiastical name. Most of our information about ʿAbdishoʿ derives from Muslim sources, most importantly from Ibn al-Nadīm, who mentions that he translated many works of logic and philosophy, and that he wrote commentaries on classical works for the Abbasid Caliph al-Maʾmūn (d. 833), and made summaries of <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>’s ‘Categories’ and ‘On Interpretation’. Ibn al-Nadīm also makes reference to his works in defense of ‘Nestorian’ Christology, among which is a response to two works by a Syr. Orth., in which ʿAbdishoʿ refuted the Syr. Orth. and Melk. ­belief in the ‘oneness of hypostasis’ (in Christ), and hence showed that ‘his wisdom was close to the wisdom of Islam’. In an anonymous report of a brief Christological discussion between ‘ʿAbdishoʿ, the Nestorian Muṭrān, <ref type="cr">Abū Qurra</ref>, the Melkite Bishop, and Abū Rāʾiṭa, the Jacobite’ before a Muslim vizier (ed. with ET by Toenies Keating), the name of the ‘Nestorian’ has been taken by most modern scholars as a reference to Cath. <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (823–28), but it is more likely that this name points to ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz, who was also a contemporary of these interlocutors. ʿAbdishoʿ’s apologetic work entitled <i>Maqāla fī al-tawḥīd wa-al-tathlīth</i>, ‘Treatise on the Unity and Trinity (of God)’ possibly still survives in mss. in Syria that have remained inaccessible so far (see Swanson). Of two works that have been published, one is in Syriac and one in Arabic. The former is his legal handbook on marriage and inheritance law (ed. Selb), the latter a treatise on logic based on Aristotle’s ‘Categories’ and <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Isagoge’ (ed. Dānishpazhūh). This work on logic, <i>Kitāb</i><i>ḥudūd al-manṭiq</i>, was commissioned by Caliph al-Maʾmūn. ʿAbdishoʿ’s connection with the Abbasid elite is further evidenced by the fact that he translated Nicomachus’s ‘Introduction to Arithmetic’ from Syriac into Arabic, for the Abbasid general Ṭāhir b. al-Ḥusayn (see Freudenthal and Lévy). He also translated works for his friend <ref type="cr">Gabriel bar Bokhtisho</ref>ʿ, presumably in the field of medicine.</p>

[Ch. of E.] 
<p>Bp. and scholar. ʿAbdishoʿ was bp. of Sinjar and <ref type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>, before becoming metropolitan bp. of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> (Ṣoba) and Armenia (ca. 1291). He wrote in Syriac and in Arabic. Although in many ways his writings crowned the achievements of a highly productive era in E.-Syr. scholarship, many of them do not survive, e.g. a commentary on OT and NT, along with other works treating doctrine, canon law, philosophy, and science. His surviving works include: <i>Margānitā</i> ‘The Pearl’, an influential systematic explanation of E.-Syr. theology; the <i>Nomocanon</i>, a compilation of synodal decrees containing the most complete collection of E.-Syr. canon law, still authoritative in the Ch. of E.; a ‘Treatise on the Rule of Ecclesiastical Judgements’, for use as an ecclesiastical court manual; and a collection of theological poetry entitled ‘Paradise of Eden’ (also known as the <i>Maqāmāt</i>). His metrical ‘Catalogue of Books’ is an invaluable repository of information about the authors and works of the Syriac literary heritage, including many that are no longer extant. Published with a Latin translation by J.-S. Assemani in Rome in 1725, the ‘Catalogue’ helped clarify for western scholarship the breadth and basic contours of Syriac literature, providing stimulus and some direction for the nascent study of Syriac literary history in the West.</p>

<ParaStyle:GP Normal 1st>ʿAbdishoʿ bar Yoḥannan d-Beth Maron, monk of the monastery of Mar Aḥa the Egyptian, in the region of Gazarta (Cizre), participated in the Synod which deposed Patr. Shemʿon VII bar Mama (1552) and elected <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref> as Patr. Cath. Recognized by the Pope, Yoḥannan ordained ʿAbdishoʿ Metr. of Gazarta. After Yoḥannan Sullaqa’s violent death in 1555, ʿAbdishoʿ succeeded him as Patr. of the newly established E.-Syr. Uniate (Chaldean) Church. He mainly resided in the Monastery of Yaʿqob the Recluse near <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>. 
<p>He wrote three Syriac panegyrics of unequal length on his predecessor. The first describes the alleged debaucheries of Patr. Shemʿon VII bar Mama, the election of Yoḥannan Sullaqa, his journey to Rome and his profession of faith submitted to the Pope, his consecration as archbishop and Patr. and his return to the Middle East. The work ends with an original description of the churches of Rome. The second poem describes the assassination of Yoḥannan Sullaqa at the instigation of Shemʿon  VII. The third is a funeral <i>madrāšā</i>. He composed in Syriac a profession of faith, destined to the Roman authorities (original lost, preserved in different Latin redactions and a retroversion into Syriac), an acrostic <i>turgāmā</i> in honor of Pope Paul IV, several liturgical pieces, a grammatical poem, and a <i>memrā</i> on the soul.</p>

<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Jersualem</ref> (1872–4) and Patr. (1906–15). Born in Ṣadad of deacon Jirjis b. ʿAbdullāh Saṭṭūf and Nasra b. Ḥanna al-Tawīl. He joined <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> in 1857, and later taught at <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> for six years where he was consecrated a deacon. In 1866, he became the secretary of Patr. Yaʿqub II in <ref type="cr">Amid</ref> who, on 19 Feb. 1867, tonsured him, then ordained him to the priesthood after two weeks. In 1870, he toured the area of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> and recorded the names of villages, monasteries, churches, clergy, and the families living in the area (ed. Bcheiry). He was consecrated bp. of Jerusalem on 3 Sept. 1872 by Patr. Peṭros IV and was named Gregorius. ʿAbdullāh accompanied the Patr. to England and India from 1874 to 1877. After the return of the Patr. from India, ʿAbdullāh stayed for two more years before going back to London where he secured a printing press for Dayr al-Zaʿfarān. After his return, ʿAbdullāh served as the bp. of Syria from 1880 to 1886.</p>
<ParaStyle:GP Normal>ʿAbdullāh paid a second visit to London, during which he attended sessions of the 1888 Lambeth Conference, and secured a second printing press. In 1890 he became the bp. of Amid. In 1895 or 1896, the Armenians persuaded ʿAbdullāh to sign a petition which, according to Shahīn, ‘went against the wishes of the Ottoman government’. The government issued an order for his exile, but ʿAbdullāh took refuge with the French consul where he joined the <ref type="cr">Syriac Catholic Church</ref>. In the Syriac Catholic Synod of 1898 in <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, ʿAbdullāh was appointed Syriac Catholic bp. of <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref> and Ḥama, and on 9  Oct. 1898 he participated in the election of Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref>, and accompanied him in 1902 to Rome, France, and Constantinople. After the deposition of the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref type="cr">ʿAbdulmasīḥ  II</ref> on 10 Nov. 1903, ʿAbdullāh was elected and then consecrated Syr. Orth. Patr. on 5 Aug. 1906. Shortly after, he visited London for the third time <i>en route</i> to India in 1908–12. In London, he met King Edward VII twice. In India, he established the Knaʿanaya diocese. After his return from India in 1912, he stayed at the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Mark</ref> until his death in 1915 and was buried there. ʿAbdullāh received a medal from King Edward VII, and two Ottoman medals from the Ottoman sultan. In 1910 he reopened the seminary at Dayr al-Zaʿfarān. He established al-Ḥikma Magazine in 1913. That same year he established for the first time a council that consisted of six clergy and six laymen. The council held its first session from 20 Feb. until 17 March 1914 but was short lived due to World War I.

<p>Abgar is named as the author of the martyrdom of Hormizd and his nine companions from <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>, who died at the end of Yazdgard’s reign (r.  399–420). P. Devos has convincingly shown that three other martyrologies — the martyrdom of Narsai of Beth Raziqaye, of Ṭaṭaq of <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref>, and of Yaʿqub the Notary  — must also have been written by Abgar. These four martyr texts are grouped together in ms. Berlin, Or. oct. 1257 and share similar content and style. The execution of all these martyrs took place at Sleq Ḥarobta, not far from <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, and in the proximity of a monastery to which in all likelihood Abgar belonged. The ‘cycle of Abgar’, as Devos has named it, must have been composed between 421 and 424 (prior to the synod of <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref> and covers the very last years of Yazdgard I’s and the beginning of Vahram V Gor’s (r. 420–38) reigns. Abgar must have been a direct witness to many of these events, and he describes them in a sober style.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Abgarids of Edessa</LemmaTitle> 
<p>Dynasty of kings who ruled in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> from ca. 133 BC until the middle of the 3rd cent. The most common names in this line of kings are Abgar and Maʿnu, both of which are of a North Arabian type. The disintegration of the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd cent. BC allowed the Abgarids to establish their power. With the appearance of the Romans in the Near East in the 1st cent. BC, the Abgarids were able to maintain Edessa and the surrounding area of Osrhoene as a more or less independent buffer state between the Roman and the Parthian empires. Our main source for the list of ca. 30 Edessene kings is the late 8th-cent.<ref type="cr"> Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>. Additional information is occasionally provided by other sources, Syriac and non-Syriac, as well as by coins. Of particular interest is the E.-Syr. Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (d. 1046).</p>
<p>Our knowledge of the earliest history is very limited. It becomes more substantial from the moment when Rome began to extend its reach into Mesopotamia, i.e., from Abgar VII (109–116) on through the end of the dynasty. In the 2nd and early 3rd cent. the relationship between Rome and Edessa intensified; it reached its climax under Abgar VIII, the Great (177–212). Rome finally imposed its power on Edessa when in 212/13 the short-lived reign of Abgar VIII’s successor was ended and the city declared a Roman colonia. The dynasty was briefly restored in 239, but by 242 Rome had once again taken full control. Whether this was the definitive end or whether the dynasty in one form or another continued to exist for some years, as <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> seems to suggest in his Chronicle, is unclear.</p>
<p>It is under the Abgarid kings that the distinctive <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> language form that later became known as ‘Syriac’ first started being used in <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref>. The <ref type="cr">script</ref> of the inscriptions is closely related to the <i>Esṭrangela</i> of the earliest, 5th-cent. Syriac mss. (even though some of the mosaic inscriptions exhibit a slightly more cursive type). Mosaics, numismatic evidence, and a number of inscriptions, mostly funerary, provide glimpses into Edessa’s social and cultural life. In addition to its Aramaic background, these also reveal the impact of Roman as well as of Parthian culture. Several of the preserved mosaics can be dated to the reign of Abgar VIII or to the period when Edessa was under Roman rule.</p>
<p>The two kings most closely associated with Syriac Christianity are Abgar V Ukkama (‘the Black’, 4  BC–AD 7 and 13–50) and Abgar VIII. The former was alleged to have corresponded with Jesus and, at the arrival of the apostle Addai, to have converted to Christianity, along with most of the city. This legend is first mentioned in <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History (early 4th cent.) and is further developed in the early 5th-cent. <ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref>. Some scholars have suggested that the historical kernel relates to Abgar VIII and was retrojected into the reign of Abgar V. However, the few indications that Abgar VIII might have been a Christian each pose their problems. First, the addition in the Book of the Laws of Countries, by <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>’s pupil Philippus (ca. 200), that Abgar VIII outlawed the practice of self-castration ‘when he came to faith’ (<i>kad haymen</i>) may very well be a later interpolation, as it is lacking from the quotation of the relevant passage in Eusebius of Caesarea’s ‘<i>Preparation for the Gospel</i>’ (VI,10,44). Second, even though Sextus Julius Africanus describes Abgar VIII as a ‘holy man’ (as quoted from the ‘Kestoi’ in George Synkellos’s ‘<i>Chronography’</i>), this does not necessarily point to the Christian religion. As a matter of fact, the various renderings of this term include not only <i>hieros</i>‘holy’ (<i>Synkellos</i>), <i>sanctus</i>‘holy’ (Jerome’s Latin translation of Eusebius’s Chronicle), and <i>kāhnāyā</i> ‘priestly’ (Yaʿqub of Edessa), but also terms that do not take on a religious connotation, such as <i>šappirā</i> ‘excellent’ (Chronicle to the year 724) and <i>azniw</i> ‘noble’ (Armenian version of Eusebius’s Chronicle). Also noteworthy is the fact that the coins and the mosaic portrait of Abgar VIII (published by Drijvers) do not reveal any Christian symbols or ideology. It is very unlikely, therefore, that Abgar VIII — or any other king of the Abgar dynasty — ever converted to Christianity. Christianity, however, did exist in Edessa under Abgar  VIII. According to Sextus Julius Africanus, the Christian author Bardaiṣan was an intimate of the royal court. In addition, a brief comment (seen by some as a later addition) in the account of the flood of Edessa in the year 201, as preserved in the 6th-cent. <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, reports that the ‘sanctuary of the church of the Christians’ (<i>hayklā d-ʿedtā da-kresṭyāne</i>) had suffered damage.</p>
<p>If none of the Edessene kings ever was Christian, it is all the more interesting that the Abgarid dynasty, decades after its disappearance, had a Christian afterlife and became an important element in the self-definition of Syriac Christians.</p>

<p>Nicknamed ‘the Lame of Beth Ṣayyade’ after the village in <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref> where he was born, he was the disciple of the reformer of ecclesiastical music Babai of Gbilta and later became teacher at the School of Bashosh in Persia, founded by Babai, and the School of Marga. At the end of his life, he established himself at the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref> near <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, known as the Upper Monastery. According to <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>, he was the author of a Book of admonition, a Commentary of Marcus Eremita, a Disputation with the Jews, a work on the Royal Path, some <i>memre</i> on penitence and different letters. Of the latter, only his Letter to a certain Yoḥannan, who had decided to embrace the monastic life, is preserved. It is followed by some spiritual admonitions (<i>zuhhāre</i>). His importance for Syriac lexicography is acknowledged by <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>, who mentions him in the introduction to his Syriac-Arabic lexicon. According to <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>, a certain Abraham, who may have been Abraham bar Dashandad, was also active as a copyist of works of <ref type="cr">John Chryso­stom</ref> (including one of his writings to the fallen Theodore [<i>CPG</i> 4305] and the Letters to Olympias [<i>CPG</i> 4405]) and <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>.

<p>Teacher of biblical interpretation and director of the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>. Our main sources for Abraham’s life are the two works attributed to <ref type="cr">Barḥadbshabba</ref> and the Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref>. The second part of Abraham’s name, ‘from the house of our master’ (<i>d-Beth Rabban</i>), is generally understood to refer to <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>, the first director of the School of Nisibis, who may have been Abraham’s relative. Barḥadbshabba the historian presents Abraham as Narsai’s immediate successor and in charge of the school for 20 years (502/3 – ca. 522). According to Barḥadbeshabba, Abra­ham was then temporarily replaced by <ref type="cr">Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye</ref> but he returned to his office a few years later and held it until his death, probably in 569. Other sources present Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye as Narsai’s immediate successor and put the beginning of Abraham’s tenure ca. 510. For some time during his directorship Abraham may have been assisted by his relative <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Beth Rabban</ref>. During Abraham’s directorship the School flourished and had its greatest expansion, despite Abraham often being the target of attacks both from within and from outside the E.-Syr. community.</p>
<p>Barḥadbshabba the historian credits Abraham with building activities in the School, including a hospice (<i>xenodochion</i>) for the sick and cells and baths for the students. As an instructor in biblical interpretation he may have played an important role in the transmission of the commentaries of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia.</ref>Barḥadbshabba reports that ‘he edited and explained’ (<i>ktab w-pa</i><i>ššeq</i>) Theodore’s commentaries, because they were too difficult for the students. In this process he is said to have followed ‘the tradition that he had received from his teacher’ (i.e. Narsai). Unfortunately, none of Abraham’s works have survived. He is, however, often quoted in later E.-Syr. commentaries on several OT books.</p>

<p>Monk, founder and abbot of the ‘Great Monastery’ on Mount Izla. Several biographical accounts of Abraham’s life have been preserved, but since their primary goal was to establish Abraham’s authority as monastic reformer, their historical information should be used with caution.</p>
<p>Abraham was from the region of Kashkar (later al-Wāsiṭ, in present-day southern Iraq). After a period of preaching in <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref>, he is said to have traveled to the Egyptian desert of Scetis, to Mount Sinai, and to <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>. He then spent some time at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>, where he studied with <ref type="cr">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref> and with <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Beth Rabban</ref>, before settling, around the middle of the 6th cent., on Mount Izla, in the vicinity of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>. He built the ‘Great Monastery’ and assembled many disciples. A  monastic rule, consisting of twelve canons, was issued in 570. In the following decades, Abraham’s disciples founded monasteries all over Mesopotamia and Persia. Many of the great ascetics of the Ch. of E. are associated with Abraham’s monastic movement.</p>
<p><ab type="infobox"/>Monastic life on Mount Izla was of the Egyptian type and consisted of a combination of solitary and coenobitic lifestyles. Whether it was modeled on monasticism in Scetis as Abraham personally experienced it during his travels, or whether Abraham’s alleged Egyptian ‘pilgrimage’ served to legitimate the reform, remains an open question. It also is debated whether E.-Syr. Christianity was exposed to Egyptian asceticism only in Abraham’s day or whether this already had happened much earlier, perhaps under Mar <ref type="cr">Awgen</ref>, the 
4th-cent. Egyptian ascetic who was said to have come to Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>Although asceticism and monasticism must have existed in the Ch. of E. long before Abraham, they had been marginalized by the synods of the late 5th  cent. Abraham succeeded in bringing them back to the center of the church, where they developed under the control of the ecclesiastical and theological authorities. Abraham is said to have introduced a distinct tonsure and dress for the monks of his new movement, thus distinguishing them from Syr. Orth. monks as well as from dissenters within the Ch. of E. who, continuing perhaps some of the earlier patterns of asceticism, were often branded as ‘Messalians’.</p>

[Ch. of E.]
<p>Monastic author. Very little is known about the life of Abraham. ‘Nathpar’ (in some sources, ‘Nephtar’, or ‘Nephrath’) appears to be the same as modern Guwair, southeast of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> in Iraq, and may designate either Abraham’s birthplace or the site of his monastery. Abraham flourished during the period of monastic revival sweeping the Ch. of E. due to the reforms of <ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref> at Mount Izla. The ‘Catalogue’ of <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>credits Abraham with having written ‘various compositions’, mainly on the spiritual life, some of which were translated into Persian. A study of them suggests that Abraham tended to adapt older ascetic materials (e.g. <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>) rather than compose his own. Some of the works ascribed to him actually derive from other authors (e.g. <ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref> and <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>). In the mid-7th cent., Sabrishoʿ Rustam, while head of the monastery of Beth Qoqa, wrote a biography of Abraham, which has not survived (Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 3.1, 454–5).</p>

<p>Syriac writing containing the legendary correspondence between Jesus and King Abgar of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, the report of the apostle Addai’s mission to Edessa and of the city’s christianization, and the story of the finding of the Cross by Protonike, the wife of emperor Claudius. Towards the end, the text claims to have been written by Labubna, the king’s scribe, and to have been deposited in the royal archives at Edessa.</p>
<p>An earlier and shorter version of part of this story exists in the first book (I,13) of the Greek Ecclesiastical History of <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref> (written in the late 3rd and early 4th cent.), who mentions a Syriac document from the archives of Edessa as his source. In Eusebius’s text Addai is known by the name Thaddaios (Thaddeus), and some of the details of the later story, such as the portrait of Jesus, are missing. Eusebius’s account ends after Abgar is healed and Thaddaios is asked to speak to the people of Edessa, a prelude to the city’s conversion. The Ecclesiastical History was translated into Syriac around 400. The exact relationship between Eusebius’s text and the early 5th-cent. <i>Teaching</i> remains somewhat unclear, and several expansions of the <i>Teaching</i> obviously belong to the 4th and 5th cent.</p>
<p>Eusebius’s claim of a written source appears plausible, which implies that the kernel of the story was composed, at the latest, towards the end of the 3rd cent. What is remarkable, however, is the paucity of outside corroboration for this story. In the approximately 100 years between Eusebius’s work and the Teaching, no mention is made of this story in Syriac sources. The complete silence of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, who spent the last ten years of his life in Edessa, as well as of the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, a mid-6th-cent. composition that includes important information on 4th-cent. Edessa, is particularly striking. The earliest affirmation of the story is by Egeria, who mentions it in her Latin travelogue (383–84). It is only after the <i>Teaching</i> begins to circulate that Syriac sources begin to reference the story.</p>
<p>The origins of the story are difficult to discern. The most plausible theory takes into account the heterogeneous nature of the earliest Christianity in Edessa. In the 2nd and 3rd cent. Edessa was home to many competing groups, as the followers of <ref type="cr">Marcion</ref>, <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>, <ref type="cr">Mani</ref>, a ‘proto-orthodox’ group, and others all vied for authority. The story most likely originated inside one of these groups fighting for both supremacy and authenticity. Whatever is the case, the group that later became dominant and represented orthodox Christianity perpetuated the story in order to substantiate its claim as the true faith.</p>
<p>The story’s popularity reveals its importance for later Syriac Christianity. Accordingly, Syriac Christianity could trace its roots all the way back to the apostles and to Jesus himself. Also significant is the connection that the story establishes between Edessa, <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, and Rome, thus linking the nascent Edessene church to Christianity in the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>An interesting subplot surrounds the portrait of Christ in the <i>Teaching</i>. While this portrait does not occur in Eusebius, and is only briefly mentioned in the <i>Teaching</i> as a portrait painted by Ḥannan, the tabularius, it later became famous in Byzantine Christianity. From the late 6th cent. onwards, the portrait was said to have been ‘made not by human hands’. In 944, the portrait was taken to Constantinople and became an icon of great importance. There is no trace of it after the sack of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204.</p>
<p>The full Syriac text of the Teaching is preserved in one early ms., which was written probably in Edessa around 500 (nowadays in the library of St. Petersburg), while extracts exist in a few other mss. In the 5th cent., the Syriac text was translated into Armenian; in the ensuing centuries the legend became fully part of Armenian historiography. There are also translations into Arabic. From Arabic it found its way into Ethiopic, where it enjoyed great popularity.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Classical Adiabene, Syriac <i>Ḥ</i><i>adyāb</i>, refers to the region between the Upper and Lower Zab rivers, from the Tigris in the west to Mt. Ṣalāḥ al-dīn (= Mt. Pirmum) in the east. Its main city was the ancient Assyrian Arbaʾil (modern Arbīl), seat of Ishtar of <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>, goddess of war and collaborator in the creation of humans. Ḥazzā, the name referring to Adiabene in Arabic sources, was an earlier center of the region, located some 12 km. southeast of Arbīl. The impressive citadel of Arbela contains remains from the Neolithic period to modern times, including Sasanian, Christian, and Islamic levels in between. Arbaʾil was a caravan city on a trade route linking southern Mesopotamia and Persia with Palestine and Egypt, as shown in an Aramaic letter signed by Arshama, the Achaemenid satrap of Egypt (late 5th cent. BC). During the 1st cent. AD the local royal family converted to Judaism, under Izates, who enjoyed quite a remarkable reign according to <ref type="cr">Josephus</ref> (‘Antiquities’, 20.17–94). Christianity spread into this region quite quickly, with Papa possibly serving as its first metropolitan as of 310. The Synod of 410 held in <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> declared Adiabene a metropolitan seat, occupied in that year by Daniel. Thereafter, Adiabene grew into a great administrative province of the Ch. of E., though it suffered several persecutions, especially under Shapur  II (309–379). The jurisdiction of the metropolitan of Adiabene was not restricted to his own province but extended at one point to include Azerbaijan and <ref type="cr">Nineveh</ref>, divided into nine suffragan dioceses. When <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> grew in political and economic importance at the beginning of the 
9th cent., it separated from Adiabene, but the latter continued to be a Metropolitan see until the beginning of the 17th cent. By the end of the 18th cent. most of Adiabene joined the Catholic uniate movement, and Arbela fell under the jurisdiction of the Chaldean archbishop of Kirkuk.</p>

<p>Greek author of animal fables which came to enjoy a very wide popularity in numerous forms and languages. Three related Syriac collections survive, a standard collection with 64 fables, in a number of mss., but a larger one in a single ms. with 83 fables, and a third collection with only 10; Aesop’s name was corrupted into ‘Iosipos’ and identified as <ref type="cr">Josephus</ref>in the ‘Catalogue’ of <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>. The Syriac translation has been variously dated between the 9th and 11th cent. It subsequently came to circulate in Jewish circles in Hebrew characters (attributed to ‘Sophos’), and in the 11th cent. a Greek translation was made by Michael Andreopoulos in <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>; in this the author’s name came to be given as Syntipas (the Syriac <ref type="cr">Sindbad</ref> having been translated at the same time).</p>
<p>In the Life of Aesop, written in Greek (1st cent. AD), sections 101–23 draw heavily on the story of <ref type="cr">Aḥiqar</ref>, evidently available in Greek (now lost).</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Aḥiqar</LemmaTitle> 
<p>Aḥiqar, ‘the Aramean Sage’ who is mentioned in an Akkadian text, is the hero of a narrative set in the Assyrian Court: as the Minister of Sennacherib (705–681 BC) and Esarhaddon (680–69 BC), he instructs his nephew Nadan by means of wise sayings, so that in due course he might succeed him; Nadan, however, is impatient and plots to have the Assyrian king put Aḥiqar to death, but a friend hides the Sage and only reveals that he is still alive when the Assyrian king is put to a challenge by the Egyptian Pharaoh. Aḥiqar is produced and solves the riddling challenge; he then proceeds to give Nadan a second set of instructions, this time admonitory in character.</p>
<p>A collection of sayings by Aḥiqar, and a narrative concerning him, is already known in Imperial <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> in fragmentary form from a papyrus from Elephantine (south Egypt) dated to the 5th cent. BC (the recent identification of the erased under-text as a customs document concerning shipping cargos, dated 475 BC, provides a <i>terminus post quem</i>); here the king is Esarhaddon. Very probably the sayings and the narrative once circulated independently in slightly different dialects, but in their combined form they have proved very influential over the course of time in many different languages, and they have continued to be read up to the present day. In the Hellenistic period Aḥiqar is mentioned by name in the book of Tobit (1:21–2; 2:10; 11:19; 14:10, 15), and traces of the work have been found in Egyptian Demotic. It must also have been translated into Greek, since ‘Akikharos’ is mentioned by several Greek authors, and much of the narrative has been reused in the Greek Life of <ref type="cr">Aesop</ref> (probably 1st cent.); furthermore, a lost Greek translation must lie behind the subsequent translations into Old Slavonic and Romanian.</p>
<p>Five recensions of the Syriac form of the Story are preserved, and these evidently go back to a lost older Syriac text which will have been the basis for the Armenian version (which in turn was the source for the Georgian and Old Turkish translations), and for the Arabic adaptations (sometimes under the name of Luqman). The Ethiopic translation derives from Arabic, and the Modern Syriac versions, though based on Classical Syriac, also show some influence from Arabic forms of the Story.</p>

<p>Exegete from <ref type="cr">Beth Qaṭraye</ref> mentioned by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>. According to Assemani he lived around 990. Cowley suggests identifying this Aḥob with Ayyub, ‘the interpreter of Seleucia’, who lived at the end of the 6th cent. His main argument is that <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> (9th  cent.) has quoted Aḥob. In all likelihood Christianity had already disappeared from the Beth Qaṭraye region by the beginning of the 10th  cent.; therefore, it would indeed seem wise not to date him much later than other important scholars from Beth Qaṭraye such as <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>, <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref>. Assuming that Cowley is right, Aḥob was born in Qaṭar and must have migrated to <ref type="cr">Seleucia</ref>. The Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref> states that he was considered for election as Cath. in 581, when <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ<ref type="cr">yahb</ref> was chosen.</p>
<ParaStyle:GP Normal>ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha’s ‘Catalogue’ credits Aḥob with an ‘Elucidation of the whole New (Testament), of the Pentateuch and all the Prophets, in addition to (or: except for) an elucidation of the Beth Mawtbe (i.e. Josh., Judges, 1–2 Sam., 1–2 Kings, Ruth, and wisdom books)’. These works have not been handed down to us: the New Testament commentary Baumstark suggested to attribute to Aḥob is lost (ms. Siirt 27). We do have quotations in later authors, however. 
<p>The Genesis part of the Anonymous Commentary on the Pentateuch (9th/10th cent.) contains two references to Aḥob, according to some of the manuscripts. Especially important are the quotations in the Commentary on Psalms ascribed to <ref type="cr">Denḥa</ref> (9th  cent.?), partly in the margins and partly in the text itself. Some of these present the exegesis of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. The parallels between Aḥob and Ishoʿdad of Merv can be explained by assuming that Ishoʿdad used Aḥob, but not the other way round. Aḥob was an important source for Ishoʿdad’s alternative readings of the biblical text, especially the readings attributed to ‘the Hebrew’. The 
19th-cent. mss. (ms. Mingana Syr. 58 and ms. Cambridge Or. 1318, among others) containing the Denḥa commentary also include a Book on the cause of the Psalms of Mar Aḥob Qaṭraya. Mingana and Vosté’s attribution to him of yet another treatise, a classification of the Psalms, is probably incorrect, however.</p>
<p>Fragments of Aḥob were also quoted by <ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043) in his biblical commentaries in Arabic, whence they found their way to Ethiopia, where they were first translated into Ethiopic and later received a place in the Amharic Andemta commentary tradition. Further references to Aḥob can be found in <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>’s Lexicon and in <ref type="cr">Isḥaq Shbadnaya</ref>’s prose commentary on his own Poem on the Divine Government of the World from the Creation to the Consummation

Ambrosius (1469 – ca. 1540)
<p>Italian humanist, belonging to the earliest generation of Syriac scholars. He became Doctor of Canon and Civil Law in Pavia, his native city. After receiving the Holy Orders and joining the <i>Canons Regular of Saint Augustine, Albonesi went to Rome, where Cardinal Bernardino López Carvajal, on behalf of Pope Leo X, commissioned him to examine the Syriac version of the Maronite missal. Thus Albonesi made the acquaintance of the three delegates of the Maronite patriarch to the Fifth Lateran Council (1512–17): the priest Joseph Kūri (Acurius), the deacon Moses, and the subdeacon Elias bar Abraham (from whose hand came the first Syriac mss. to enter the Vatican Library). At that time Albonesi knew no Syriac, but he had studied Hebrew in Rome with some Jewish scholars, among whom were Joseph Zarfati, Abraham of Balmes, and a certain</i>ʿ<i>Abdias (perhaps</i>ʿO<i>badiah Sforno, Reuchlin’s teacher). Zarfati, who, like the Lebanese envoys, spoke Arabic, served as an interpreter, allowing the translation of the Syriac missal into Latin via Arabic and Italian (the product of this enterprise is found in codex Estensis</i>α.R.7.20 in Modena).<i> Albonesi returned to his hometown with the knowledge of Syriac that he had gained by studying under Elias’s guidance and with a ms. of the Syriac Psalter that he intended to publish. Both the ms. and the types he had produced were, however, destroyed during the sack of Pavia on the part of the French army of François I (1527). The unexpected finding of his lost ms. among the wrapping paper of a sausage-maker in Ferrara reportedly prompted Albonesi to rebuild his typography and to devote himself to the preparation of that which he meant to be an introduction to the edition of the Syriac Psalter. The book, entitled Introductio in Chaldaicam linguam,</i><i>Syriacam atque Armenicam, & decem alias linguas…</i> (‘Introduction to Chaldean, Syriac, Armenian, and ten other languages…’, Pavia, 1539), was finally printed by<i> Giovanni Maria Simonetta. The previous year Guillaume Postel had already xylographically reproduced, in his Duodecim characteribus differentium alphabetum…</i>(Paris, 1538), two brief Syriac texts. Albonesi’s <i>Introductio</i>, however, despite some graphic inaccuracies, presented for the first time in Europe a substantial amount of information about the Syriac language, as well as Syriac texts of some length. Albonesi was also instrumental in igniting Johann <i>Albrecht Widmanstetter’s interest in Syriac. Widmanstetter, whom</i>Albonesi <i>met in Reggio Emilia in 1529, would eventually publish, along with</i><ref type="cr">Mushe of Mardin</ref><i>, the first edition of the NT Peshitta (Vienna, 1555).</i></p>

<p>City in northern Syria and an important center of Christianity in the Middle East today as the seat of a total of nine bishoprics (Syr. Orth., Syr. Catholic, Chald., Maron., Melk. Orth., Melk. Catholic, Armenian Orth., Armenian Catholic, Latin). Aleppo, nicknamed ‘Grey Aleppo’ (<i>Ḥalab al-šahbā</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ) in Arabic, owes its military and commercial importance to its imposing citadel and its favorable position on the trade route linking the nearby Mediterranean coast with Mesopotamia and areas beyond. Aleppo’s history goes back at least to the second millenium BC. The earliest known names of Aleppo are cognates of the modern name ‘Ḥalab’, but Seleucus Nicator (d.  281  BC) who founded a Greek colony here named it after ‘Beroea’ in Macedonia, and it is by that name that Aleppo is normally known in older Syriac literature. Aleppo came under Roman rule in 64 BC. After the Arab conquest in 636, Aleppo first rose to prominence under the Ḥamdānid Sayf al-Dawla (945–67). Aleppo later became the seat of lines of Zangids (1129–83) and Ayyūbids (1183–1260). Aleppo was taken by the Mongols in 1260 and a little 
later by the Mamlukes. Under the Ottomans (1516–1918), Aleppo became the capital of a province covering much of today’s northern Syria and a significant part of Turkey (including <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, Alexandretta/Iskenderun, and ʿAintab/Gaziantep). For much of that period, it was the third largest city in the Ottoman Empire after Istanbul and Cairo, and the Christians, including Syr. Christians, as well as a larger number of Melkites and later an increasing number of Armenians, then played an important role in the life of the city, one noteworthy member of the Aleppine Syr. Catholic community from the period 
being the world-famous chess player Philip Stamma (ca. 1705–55). Aleppo is today the largest city in Syria with a population of ca. 1.7 million (2.85 million in the larger conurbation, in 2008).</p>
<p>The first known bp. of Aleppo is Eustathius, who became Patr. of Antioch and attended the Council of Nicaea in that capacity. Bp. Peter of Aleppo was a supporter of <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> at the Synod of Sidon in 511, while Bp. Antoninus was among the Miaphysite bishops exiled with <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> under Emperor Justin.</p>
<p>The first known Syr. Orth. bp. after the reorganization of the church in the mid-6th cent. is Matthew (644–669). Among his successors was <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (ca. 1253–64), who was the bp. there when the city fell to the Mongols in 1260. Little is known about the Syr. Orth. community in the subsequent period until the beginning of the 16th cent., when we first hear of a Syr. Orth. (later Syr. Catholic) church of the Mother of God in the Christian quarter of Judayda (Jdeideh), and we find Aleppo included, along with <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref> and Ḥama, in the title of Metr. <ref type="cr">Grigorios Yawseph the Iberian</ref> of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> (metr. 1515–37). From the second half of the 16th cent. onwards, we frequently hear of visits to Aleppo by Syr. Orth. patriarchs, including Ignatius Pilatus I (Patr. 1591–97) who died and was buried in Aleppo. The Syr. Orth. community in Aleppo, reduced to a small number through large-scale conversions to the Syr. Catholic Church since the latter half of the 18th cent., was reinforced in the 20th cent. by refugees fleeing the atrocities in areas now in the Republic of Turkey. These refugees included a group from <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, who migrated to Aleppo en masse in 1924, as well as those from the area around <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>.</p>
<p>As a center of Latin missionary activity since the beginning of the Ottoman era, with Capuchins, Jesuits and Carmelites present in the city by 1526, Aleppo played an important role in the formation of the <ref type="cr">Syriac Catholic Church</ref>. Andrew Akhījān (Patr. 1662–78) worked and was elected Patr. in Aleppo, while Michael Jarweh (Patr. 1782–1800) was born in Aleppo and was Metr. of Aleppo prior to his elevation to the patriarchate. The central role Aleppo continued to play in the life of the Syr. Cath. Church is reflected in the fact that five out of the thirteen successors of Michael Jarweh have been natives of Aleppo (Michael Ḍāhir, Peter Jarweh, George Chelhot, Antony Ḥayek, Peter ʿAbd al-Aḥad), while two others were Metr. of Aleppo before ascending to the patriarchate (<ref type="cr">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref>, <ref type="cr">Gabriel Tappuni</ref>).</p>
<p>The E.-Syr. see of Aleppo is attested in the 11th cent. and is also mentioned as a suffragan of Damascus in a list of bishoprics appended, in a 13th-cent. ms., to the canonical works of Elias of Damascus (ca. 900), but it was probably extinct by the 13th cent. Nothing is then heard of the E.-Syr. presence in Aleppo until the 17th cent. The Chald. diocese of Aleppo, founded as a patriarchal vicariate in 1901 and raised to the status of an eparchy in 1957, today covers the whole of Syria.</p>
<p>The presence of an early Maronite community in Aleppo in 727 is recorded in the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>. Significant presence of Maronites in the modern period dates from the 17th cent., with Maronite bishops regularly resident in the city since 1686. Aleppo played an important role in the life of the Maronite Church as one of her few urban centers, and the Maronite school there produced such men as the three founders of the Maronite Aleppine Order (later Mariamites) and the scholar-bishop Germanus Farḥāt (bp. of Aleppo 1725–32). The Maronite woman mystic Hindiyya al-ʿUjaymī was born in Aleppo in 1720.</p>
<p>In the first decade of the 20th cent., there were reported to be approximately 35,000–40,000 Christians in the city, making up about one third of the total population and including: 3,500 Syr. Catholics (4,000 in the diocese), 50 Syr. Orth. (500 in the diocese), 250 Chald. and 3,600 Maron. (Karalevsky); as well as 1,200 Melk. Orth., 10,000 Melk. Catholics, 15,000 Armenian Orth., 5,500–7,000 Armenian Catholics, 1,100 Latins and 1,500 Protestants (Tournebize). The numbers reported today for the Syriac dioceses of Aleppo are: Syr. Orth. 15,000 (in 2003, Zinda Magazine); Syr. Catholic 8,000 (in 2006, <i>Annuario pontificio</i>); Chald. 15,000 (in 2006, <i>Annuario pontificio</i>, for whole of Syria); Maron. 4,000 (in 2006, <i>Annuario pontificio</i>). The actual numbers (esp. for the Chaldeans) will have been increased significantly by those fleeing insecurity in Iraq since 2003.</p>
<p>Little is known about the sites of the medieval Syriac churches in Aleppo. The churches dating from the Ottoman period are found in the traditional Christian quarter in Judayda just north of the medieval city. These include the Melkite and Armenian churches concentrated in the Ṣalībat al-Judayda Quarter, as well as the Syr. Catholic Church of Mār Āsyā al-Ḥakīm (formerly Mother of God) a little to the east, and the Maronite Cathedral of Mar Eliya to the north. A  number of newer churches, including the Syr. Catholic Cathedral (Umm al-Intiqāl/Assumption, 1970), are found in the ʿAzīziyya District to the north of Judayda. The Chaldean Cathedral and the Syr. Orth. Cathedral of Mar Ephrem lie further north in Sulaymāniyya. Further churches belonging to the Syriac communities are found in the ‘Old Syriac Quarter’ (Ḥayy al-Suryān al-Qadīm) just behind the railway station to the northwest of the city center, a quarter established by migrants from Edessa (Mār Jirjis, Syr. Orth.; Mār Afrām, Syr. Catholic), and in the ‘New Syriac Quarter’ (Ḥayy al-Suryān al-Jadīd) further northwest (Sayyidat al-Suryān ‘Our Lady of the Syriacs’, Syr. Orth.).</p>
<p>Important collections of Christian Arabic and Syriac mss. are found in Aleppo at the Maron. Archiepiscopal Residence (over 1640 mss.), Fondation Georges et Mathilde Salem (most of Sbath Collection, no. 777–1321, and some additional mss.), Syr. Catholic Archiepiscopal Residence (ca. 500 mss.) and Syr. Orth. Archiepiscopal Residence and Church of Mar Jirjis (including the collection transferred from Edessa, ca. 225 mss.), as well as at the Melk. Catholic Archiepiscopal Residence (ca. 1,100 mss.).</p>
<p>A large number of ruined Byzantine churches are found in the so-called ‘Dead Cities’ in the hills to the west of Aleppo, including the ruins of the huge basilica built around <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>’s pillar at Qalʿāt Simʿān (approx. 30 km. west-northwest of Aleppo).</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The exploits of Alexander the Great (356–23 BC) gave rise to a very large number of works, in many different languages. The three main works concerning him in Syriac are:</p>
<p>1. A translation of Pseudo-Callisthenes, (based on the Greek recension <i>delta</i>), preserved in a number of late E.-Syr. mss. (ed. with ET by Budge). According to Nöldeke, this was not translated directly from Greek, but by way of a lost Middle Persian version; this view has, however, been recently challenged by Ciancaglini, who points to strong evidence that it was made directly from Greek. The Syriac version includes a visit by Alexander to <ref type="cr">China</ref>, which is an episode absent from all other texts. There is also a Modern Syriac version.</p>
<p>2. A narrative poem on Alexander attributed to <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, but dating almost certainly from soon after the emperor Heraclius’s victory over the Persians (629/30). The different recensions are edited by Reinink (ET in Budge, 163–200).</p>
<p>3. A christianized legend of Alexander entitled ‘The exploits of Alexander’. This is found in the mss. of the Syriac version of Pseudo-Callisthenes (and is included in Budge’s edition) and, in a somewhat different, but related, form, in the <ref type="cr">Zuqnin Chronicle</ref>. This too is thought to date from shortly after 629/30. According to van 
Bladel (2008), this provided the source for the section on Alexander in the Qurʾān.</p>
<p>Other Syriac texts relating to Alexander are:</p>
<p>4. A short life, preserved in a single ms. of the 8th/9th cent. (ET in Budge, 159–61).</p>
<p>5. Sayings attributed to Alexander, preserved in various sources, including <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s Amusing Stories.</p>
<p>6. A set of short laments over Alexander, said to have been uttered by various philosophers. These are also found in Arabic, in the Annals of Eutychius (ca. 935).</p>
<p>7. An account of Alexander’s encounter with the Brahmin Dandamis (an excerpt from <ref type="cr">Palladius</ref>’s ‘On the Peoples of India and on the Brahmins’).</p>
<p>8. Various notices in Chronicles.</p>
<p>9. Ms. Vat. Syr. 555 (W.-Syr., dated 1501) contains an astronomical ‘Book of Alexander’.</p>

<LemmaTitle>Alqosh</LemmaTitle> 
<p>Town 40 km. north of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> in Iraq. Seat of a Chald. bishopric. It now numbers around 5,000 inhabitants. Many families and individuals migrated from Alqosh to larger Iraqi cities (Mosul, <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>, etc.) or abroad, especially to the USA and UK. The town’s economy is based on agriculture (wheat, barley, chickpeas, lentils, beans, cucumbers, gourds, melons, grapes, and figs) and animal husbandry (sheep and goats). Traditional trades included weaving and dying cloth. Alqosh is a major spiritual center. Jews used to go on pilgrimage to the tomb believed to be that of the prophet Nahum, who, according to an interpretation of Nah 1.1, may have come from Alqosh. Two important E.-Syr. monasteries lie close to Alqosh: the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Rabban Hormizd</ref>, founded in the 7th   cent., used to be one of the patriarchal residences of the Ch. of E., later moved to Mosul, then Baghdad, and the more recent Monastery of the Virgin, also known as ‘the Lower Monastery’ or ‘of Our Lady of the Seeds’. From the 16th cent. the cultural life of the village flourished thanks to the so-called <ref type="cr">School of Alqosh</ref>. Alqosh was pillaged several times, by Murād Bey (Bar Yak) in 1508, the Pasha of ʿAmadiyya in 1740, the Persians in 1743. People sought refuge on the mountain, in the Monastery of Rabban Hormizd, but there were rapes and casualties. Around the mid-16th cent. some of the population supported <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref>, the first Chald. Patr. elected with official approval of Rome. In 1767, around 100 of the 500 families were Catholic. Literary sources and annotations made by European travelers record recurrent cases of pestilence and famine, caused by draught or locusts, which devastated the region during the 19th cent. In 1832 and 1842 the village was attacked and pillaged by Kurds.</p>

<p>E.-Syr. authors and scribes, most of them priests, who brought about a remarkable revival of literary activities among E.-Syr. communities in N. Iraq. <ref type="cr">Israel of Alqosh</ref> is considered the founder of this School. <ref type="cr">Baumstark</ref> limited the school to the poets of <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref>, whereas Macuch included writers and copyists of a wider area encompassing centers such as Gazarta, Beth Slokh, <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>, <ref type="cr">Telkepe</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>.</p>
<p>Authors wrote liturgical poetry in Classical <ref type="cr">Syriac</ref> and also occasionally in <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref>. Historical and theological prose was produced as well. Some authors had Catholic sympathies and were involved in the Uniate movement. These include <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ of Gazarta</ref>, Adam of ʿAqra (who wrote a hymn on Rabban Hormizd and a theological book), <ref type="cr">Yawsep II</ref>, and priest Khidr of Mosul (1679–1751), who spent much of his life in Rome.</p>

<LemmaTitle>Amid</head><ab type="infobox"/>Amida, Diyarbakır, Omid
<p>City in upper Mesopotamia. Situated on high ground on the right bank of the Tigris and surrounded by massive black basalt walls, which later gave it the nickname ‘Black (<i>kara</i>) Amid’, Amid was by the 4th cent. a key point in Rome’s defence of her eastern frontiers and became the most important city in the Roman province of Mesopotamia after the cession of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> to the Persians in 363. It was taken by the Persians in 359, 503, and 606/7. After the Arab conquest in 639, it was ruled by a series of dynasties including the Kurdish Marwānids (984–1085), and the Turkmen Īnālids (1097–1183), Ḥisn Kayfā Artuqids (1183–1230) and Aq Qoyunlu (1401–1507), dynasties which at one point or another made Amid their chief seat. After being taken by the Ottomans in 1515, Amid became the administrative center of a province that covered most of northern Mesopotamia from Manzikert in the north to Sinjar in the south. It is today a provincial capital and the largest city in the Turkish part of Mesopotamia with a population of over half a million. The name Diyarbakır (Arabic <i>Diyār Bakr</i>), which originally referred to the region around Amid, came to be used for the city in Ottoman times and was officially adopted in 1937, replacing the older name which goes back to Assyrian ‘Amedi’.</p>
<p>Amid was evangelised at an early date, no doubt from <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. The first known bp. of Amid, Simeon, is said in a late source to have attended the Council of <ref type="cr">Nicaea</ref>. His successors include Acacius, celebrated for his ransoming of Roman soldiers taken captive by the Persians in 423/4, as well as Asterios and Shemʿon, the only bishops from the province of Mesopotamia to attend the councils, respectively, of Ephesus and Chalcedon. The area around Amid was an important center of monasticism with five monasteries within the city by 525 (<ref type="cr">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>, Ecclesiastical History, VIII.5). Well-known monasteries in the immediate vicinity include those of 1. the Edessenes (4th cent., probably on a site just south of the city wall); 2. Yoḥannan Urṭaya (4th cent., north of the city wall), where <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> spent his youth; and 3. Zuqnin, the home of the <ref type="cr">Zuqnin Chronicle</ref>. Of importance at a later date was the Monastery of Prophet Elijah near the village of Qanqart, ca. 
8 km. southwest of Amid (attested 11th–19th cent.).</p>
<p>In the period after the Council of Chalcedon, Amid was a Miaphysite stronghold, and Bp. Mara of Amid was one of those bps. expelled from their sees under Emperor Justin I. After a period of persecution for the Miaphysites under the Chalcedonian Bp. Abraham bar Kaili, a line of Miaphysite bishops was reestablished with the consecration of Eunomius in ca. 546. Among the later occupants of the see was <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>. Amid has been the seat of the Syr. Orth. patriarchs on several occasions, including a period in the 11th cent. after Dionysios IV (1032–42) took refuge in the then Marwānid city to escape persecution in Byzantine <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>, during the tenure of Ignatius <ref type="cr">ʿAbdullāh I bar Sṭephanos</ref> (1521–
1557), and in 1862–71 when Ignatius Yaʿqub II (1847–1871) took up residence in the Yoldat Aloho Church in the wake of disturbances in <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>. The Syr. Orth. see of Amid lapsed with the demise of Metr. Dionysios ʿAbd al-Nūr Aslan in 1933.</p>
<p>The presence of E.-Syr. Christians in Amid is suggested by the inclusion of ‘Amid’ in the titles of bishops of Maypherqaṭ from the 12th cent. onwards. The first Chald. patriarch, <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref>, resided in Amid after his return from Rome in 1553. Later, Amid became the residence of a new line of Chald. patriarchs from Yawsep I (1681–96) to Yawsep V (Augustin Hindi, 1781–1828). The Chald. see of Diyarbakır, vacant after 1923, was revived in name in 1966, with residence, however, in Istanbul and jurisdiction over the whole of 
Turkey (vacant since 2005 as of going to press).</p>
<p>Syriac Christians originally constituted the majority of the Christian population, but came to be outnumbered by the Armenians under Ottoman rule. The Melkite community, which had been Syriac-speaking in pre-Islamic times, dwindled after the Arab conquest, but was reinforced by migrants from <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> in the 17th cent. According to a census conducted in 1870, the city had a population of 21,372, with 9,814 Muslims, 6,853 Armenian Orth., 831 Armenian Catholics, 1,434 Syr. Orth., 174 Syr. Catholics, 976 Chald., 305 Melk. Orth., 55 Melk. Catholics, 650 Protestants and 280 Jews. In 1908, <ref type="cr">Naʿʿūm Fāʾiq</ref> published there the first number of his journal <i>Kawkbo d-madnḥo</i>. In 1914, the Syriac population of the city is reported to have stood at 8,000, and that of the thirty or so nearby villages (including Kaʿbiya, Sharukhiya, Qarabash, Quṭurbul, ʿAyn Tannūr/Ali Pınar) at 6,450. Though 
greatly diminished by the massacres during the First World War, a sizeable Christian community remained until relatively recently, with the Syr. Orth. community still numbering nearly 1,000 individuals in the early 1960’s. In 2005, the city had one resident Syr. Orth. priest and 7 Syr. Orth., 2 Chald., and 2 Armenian families.</p>
<p>Of the older churches in the city, two, both of them former patriarchal residences, remain in regular use: 
1. Yoldat Aloho (Syr. Orth., in Lāle Bey Quarter, in the southwest section of the old city, 3rd/6th cent.?), with the main church of Yoldat Aloho and that of Mor Yaʿqub adjoining it to the north and housing the relics of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>; 2. Mar Petion (Chald., in Özdemir Quarter, east of main crossroads). (An Evangelical church opened opposite Yoldat Aloho in 2003). Still in situ are: St. George’s (in the citadel, 4th cent.?), Latin (Capuchin, in northeast section of old city, 17th cent.), Protestant (southeast) and Armenian Catholic (southeast) churches, as well as the Armenian Orth. churches of Surp Giragos (adjoining Mar Petion to the east, 16th cent.) and Surp Sarkis (southwest, 16th cent.) and chapel of Surp Hagop. Two churches were demolished in the 20th cent.: 1. Cosmas and Damian (east of Yoldat Aloho, 4th cent.?, Melk. in modern period); 2. the Syr. Cath. Church (northeast, 7th cent.?). Among the churches mentioned in historical records, the one built by Emperor Heraclius in 628/9 was probably a Syr. Orth. Church, which is to be distinguished from the Melk. church (called St. Thomas?) occupying the site of the present Great Mosque (see Palmer). Other known churches (some of them possibly identical with those already mentioned) include: St. John the Baptist (place of burial, in 649/50, of Bp. Yuḥanon of the Arabs), St. Stephen (converted to fire temple in 503), Mor Zʿuro (near Urfa Gate, before 503; burial place, in 649/50, of Patr. <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of the Sedre</ref>and Shemʿun of Edessa), Mor Shilo (built by Bp. Mara ca. 520), St. Theodore (northeast, Armenian in 16th cent.) and Mor Ḥananyo (southeast?). Kırklar Dağı ‘Hill of the Forty’, to the south of the city, is probably the site of the Church of the Forty Martyrs built by Yuḥanon Soʿuro of Qarṭmin (bp. of Amid 483/4–502), who was responsible also for the construction of the nearby Tigris bridge.</p>

<p>Patr. of the Maronites, author of a Syriac grammar. Born in Ehden, Lebanon, ʿAmīra was sent to Rome in 1583, to study at the newly founded Maronite College (1584). Upon his return to Lebanon he was ordained priest, immediately followed by his consecration as bp., in 1596. In 1634 he was elected patr. Belonging to the first generation of Maronite ecclesiastical leaders trained in Rome, he was instrumental in bringing the Maronite Church further in line with the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>His significance for Syriac studies lies in the fact that he is the author of a Syr. grammar, which he wrote during his stay in Rome and which was published in 1596: <i>Grammatica syriaca, sive chaldaica</i>. After <ref type="cr">Andreas Masius</ref>’s publications, which were the first to provide systematic descriptions of the Syriac language in Europe (1571), and which served as models for some later scholars, ʿAmīra produced an entirely independent grammar, which in comparison with Masius’s work was based on a larger corpus of texts, paid more attention to the indigenous Syr. tradition, and included more discussion of syntactical problems (Contini). A partial French translation by 
J. F. de la Croix was made in 1681 (apparently unpublished). With the exception of some translations from Latin into Syriac for the Maronite Missal (published in Rome between 1592 and 1594), ʿAmīra did not publish any other Syriac work. His Arabic publications are all related to his pastoral and church-administrative work as bp. and patr.</p>

<p>The town of Amyūn is situated 20 km. south of Tripoli<ref type="cr"></ref>(Northern Lebanon), on the road between Chekka and Kousba, built on a high, rocky cliff rising above the plains of olives and fruit orchards watered by the Qadisha river. This citadel has a long history. Early neolithic burial graves are still visible in the rock walls towering over the lower town, and fragments of classical carving are built into the walls of the houses along narrow, medieval streets. During the period of the <ref type="cr">Crusades</ref>, the town belonged to the Seigneury of Besmedin, a branch of the Seigneury of Giblet (Jbeil or Byblos). Several medieval churches still function in the town.</p>
<p>The Church of Mar Phocas, which is nowadays Greek Orthodox, has a simple barrel-vaulted nave, a deeply recessed apse and two side-aisles, separated by heavy stone piers with pointed arches. Like many of the medieval Lebanese churches, it was built over the foundations of a classical temple. Only a few fragments of fresco decoration survive, and these are mostly from different periods and differing styles indicating different hands.</p>
<p>In the apse are the scant remains of an Anastasis painting. Parts of Christ’s flying cloak are visible as he pulls Adam out of the grave. Behind Adam is Eve, and behind her is Abel. On the other side are David and Solomon, and the remains of a scroll once held by John the Baptist. Above the head of Christ is a little flying angel.</p>
<p>Below the apse, in the lower zone, are eight apostles on either side of Sts. Peter and Paul. Most of these saints are too damaged to be identified.</p>
<p>On the northern wall, near the apse, is a large portrait of St. Philip, with the small figure of a donor at his side, also called Philip. On the same wall, toward the west, are the remains of <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref> between two standing saints and two flying angels. The large piers of the church are decorated on all four sides with remains of paint, showing several saints, a portrait of St. Simeon the Younger Thaumaturgos, a portrait of the standing St. Phocas, Christ Pantocrator, and an equestrian St. Theodore spearing a dragon.</p>
<p>These wall paintings are all inscribed in Greek. Some attempt has been made to write in Syriac over a long inscription in the lower zone of the apse, with the unfortunate result that neither the original Greek, nor the later Syriac is legible. Stylistically, the apse painting and the tall portrait of St. Philip closely resemble contemporary wall paintings in 12th-cent. Cyprus. The wall paintings on the piers show at least two layers of paint, and whereas the bottom layer is most likely 12th cent., the top layers belong to the 13th.</p>

<p>Large Sasanian city on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, the ruins are near present-day Falluja, ca. 60  km. west of <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>. Shapur I (241–72) fortified, or rebuilt, a pre-Sasanian town, the official name became Peruz Shapur ‘Victorious Shapur’, commemorating his victory over the Roman Emperor Gordian  III in 243. Some sources, however, connect the city with Shapur  II (310–79) and his victory over the Roman Emperor Julian in 363. The city’s popular name ‘Ambāra’ (Arab. <i>al-Anbār</i>) means ‘magazine; storehouse’, and refers to its strategic function as an arsenal of victuals and weapons for the fortified places along the western frontier. The earliest reliable information comes from the historians Ammianus Marcellinus (XXIV 2,9–22; d. ca. 395) and Zosimus (III 17,3–18,6; ca. 500). Ammianus saw the city (<i>Piri-sabora</i>) with his own eyes during the campaign of Emperor Julian. He describes it as large and populated, with a citadel and a double wall. Zosimus reports that the city (<i>Bērsabōra</i>) was second in rank after the Sasanian capital Ctesiphon. During the first centuries of Islam, al-Anbār remained prosperous, being the residence of the Abassid Caliphs al-Saffāḥ (750–54) and al-Manṣūr (754–75) until the latter moved to the new capital Baghdad (762). The city declined until the end of the first millennium; in 1262 it was sacked by the Mongols.</p>
<p>Al-Anbār was a see of the Ch. of E., first mentioned in the 5th cent. The main sources (surveyed by 
J.-M. Fiey) are the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref> and the ‘Book of the Tower’ (<i>Kitāb al-majdal</i>, ed. H. Gismondi). Several bps. are known, the last known was consecrated in 1111. Three of them bacame Cath.: Ṣliba Zka (713–28), Theodosios (853–58), and Yoḥannan bar Narsai (884–91). <ref type="cr">Eliya of al-Anbār</ref> was elected Patr. in 937, but failed to receive the Caliph’s approval. There were two monasteries in al-Anbār: St. Quryaqos and the famous one of Mar Yonan. The Jewish community in al-Anbār (probably identical with Pumbedita) was founded in the 4th cent. It was one of the largest in Babylonia (the sources are surveyed by A. Oppenheimer). A second Peruz Shapur is on the eastern bank of the Tigris near the Khabur 
inflow. <i></p>

<p>City in the historical region of Syria (today in Turkey). Titular see of Syr. Orth., Syr. Catholic, Maron., Melk. Orth., Melk. Catholic (united with Alexandria and Jerusalem) and, until 1953, Latin patriarchs. Antioch is situated at the foot of Mt. Silpius in the valley of the Orontes, approximately 25 km. from the Mediterranean coast. Founded by Seleucus I Nicator ca. 300 BC and named after his father Antiochus, Antioch grew rapidly as the capital of the Seleucids. For the Romans who took it in 64 BC it was their largest and most prosperous city in Asia. Antioch was taken by the Sasanians for the first time in 256, when Shapur I deported many of its citizens and settled them in, among other places, the city he named ‘Better is the Antioch of Shapur’, the later Gondeshapur (<ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>). After its destruction by Khusrau I in 540, the city was rebuilt on a smaller scale by Justinian, only to be attacked again by the Persians at the beginning of the 7th cent. and occupied by them for over a decade from 611. Antioch was captured by the Arabs in 637/8. Under the Byzantines again in 969–1084, it was taken by the Crusaders in 1098. The Frankish Principality of Antioch lasted until 1268, when it was conquered by the Mamluks. A minor provincial town under the Ottomans and the French mandate, Antioch became the capital of the short-lived Republic of Hatay in 1938 before being incorporated, together with the rest of the former district (sancak) of Alexandretta, into the Republic of Turkey in 1939.</p>
<p>The Apostle St. Peter and St. <ref type="cr">Ignatius of Antioch</ref> are reckoned as the first and third bishops of Antioch, and it is after them that it later became customary for the Maron. patriarchs to adopt the name ‘Peter’ and the Syr. Orth. and Syr. Catholic patriarchs the name ‘Ignatius’. The city in which St. Paul preached and the followers of Jesus were first called ‘Christian’ soon became the most important center of Christianity in Asia, and its see was recognised as ranking alongside those of Rome and Alexandria at the Council of Nicaea. The area under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Antioch that later became known as ‘patriarchate’ largely coincided with the civil diocese of the ‘East’ (Oriens) — whence the title ‘of Antioch and All the East’ still born by the patriarchs  — corresponding roughly to the parts of today’s Turkey south of the Taurus, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Holy Land, the last of which later formed a separate Patriarchate of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>(although this was recognized only by the Chalcedonian churches). The theological school at Antioch which flourished in the 4th and 5th  cent. was to have a major influence on the theology of the Ch. of E. through the writings of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> and others. Antioch was one of the major battlegrounds in the Christological controversies of the 5th and 6th cent. that led to the formation of the Syriac Churches as separate entities from the Imperial Church. Among the patriarchs of Antioch resident in Antioch, John I (428–42) was a supporter of <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>, while Peter the Fuller (468–86, with interruptions) and <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> (512–18, d. 538) were important proponents of the Miaphysite teaching.</p>
<p>Since the expulsion of Severus by Emperor Justin the Syr. Orth. patriarchs have usually been unable to reside in, or even visit, their titular see, except on such occasions as when Caliph Yazīd II allowed 
Eliya  I (709–24) to make a solemn entry into the city and consecrate a new church there in 721, and during the Crusader period, when the Frankish rulers and Latin clergy of the city tended to favor the non-Chalcedonian Christians as their allies against Muslims and Melkites. From that period we know of a forced sojourn in Antioch of Athanasios (1090–1129) in ca. 1115, as well as of more friendly visits by <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> (1166–99), who is said to have been enthroned on the chair of St. Peter during one of his visits in 1168–69, by Ignatius III Dawid (1222–52), who built a residence for himself on the outskirts of the city some time before 1246, and by <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon bar Maʿdani</ref> (1252–63), who was enthroned on the ‘chair of Great Severus’ in 1253. The Syr. Orth. had three churches in the city in 1170 (Yoldat Aloho, Mor Giwargis and Mor Barṣawmo). The visit to Antioch by Patr. Ignatius Zakka Iwas in 2000 was probably the first by a Syr. Orth. patriarch since the 13th cent.</p>
<p>In the 1920s there was a small community of Maronites in Antioch, who together with the Latin rite Christians numbered about fifty, alongside larger communities of Melkites numbering some 4,500 and Armenians numbering 400 in a total population of 20,000–30,000. Today, the city still has functioning Melk. Orth. and Latin churches. St. Peter’s Church, or Grotto, the cave believed to be the site of the first church in Antioch, lies about 2 km. to the northeast of the town center.</p>
<p>The Black Mountain (the Amanus Range) to the northwest of Antioch was a renowned center of monasticism. A number of Syriac liturgical mss. copied there attest to the continued use of Syriac alongside Greek and Georgian by Melkite monks in the region in the 
11th cent.</p>

<Author>H. Takahashi</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Anṭun of Tagrit</head><ab type="infobox"/>(9th cent.?) [Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Author of uncertain date, designated ‘rhetor’ and ‘philoponos’, according to a ms. colophon from the family of Gurgin (<i>d-beth Gurgin</i>), and a monk. Nothing is known of him apart from his works and a brief report in the Ecclesiastical History of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> to the effect that he lived at the time of the patriarch <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> (active in 825), a view which Bar ʿEbroyo declares to be generally accepted by his contemporary teachers and elders. Bar ʿEbroyo supports this by identifying an unnamed student of Greek poetry in Anṭun’s ‘Rhetoric’ with Dionysios’s brother <ref type="cr">Theodosios of Edessa</ref>, translator of the poems of <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>. The 9th-cent. dating of Anṭun has thus not gone uncontested. Mention of his works by later authors first appears in <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref> and Bar ʿEbroyo.</p>
<p>Two mss. in London (Brit. Libr. Add. 17,208 + Dayr al-Suryān 32 and Brit. Libr. Add. 14,726) contain all his known shorter writings and fragments of his major work, a treatise on rhetoric. The shorter writings comprise a substantial work ‘On Divine Providence’, notable not least for its knowledge of medicine, a treatise ‘On the Myron’, in its prologue largely identical with that by <ref type="cr">Mushe bar Kipho</ref> and probably dependent upon Pseudo-Dionysius, eight poems (five in letter form), and four liturgical hymns.</p>
<p>His most significant work is his treatise on rhetoric, in five books. Apart from the London fragments, the older mss. have perished or are now in a location difficult to access, but some copies were made from the late 19th cent. and have survived. These copies preserve the text in full, with the exception of the final part of the fifth book. The treatise is unique in Syriac literature, with the exception of its partial reproduction and paraphrasing in the ‘Book of Dialogues’ of Yaʿqub bar Shakko. It was greatly admired by Bar ʿEbroyo, who cited it frequently in his ‘Book of Splendors’ and prefaced it to the ‘Organon’ of <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref> in the curriculum of ‘external’ (i.e. secular) works he wished to see studied in the schools.</p>
<p>The main importance of the work lies in the evidence it provides of a rhetorical tradition in Syriac which has clear points of contact with the Greek (see <ref type="cr">Rhetoric</ref>). It is most unlikely that Anṭun knew Greek, but he mentions having had a teacher in the reading of Homer, and much of the treatise can only be understood on the supposition that a considerable amount of Greek rhetorical theory had been incorporated into Syriac teaching. The work is also remarkable for the range of authors cited in it as rhetorical examples. For Anṭun, as for Greek Christian rhetors, Gregory of Nazianzus was the supreme model of eloquence, but Anṭun was proud of his Syriac heritage, and in his eyes Gregory shared this position with <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, whose poetry also belonged to the sphere of rhetoric. In addition to many Greek and Syriac Christian authors, several pagan writers are cited, including Homer, Plutarch, Heliodorus, and an unknown Evodius and (Aramean) Wapha. Anṭun also exhibits knowledge of the Platonic political-philosophical concept of the philosopher-king, a concept which was also important in the thought of al-Fārābī, the great Muslim philosopher who studied with Syro-Arabic Christian Aristotelian 
philosophers in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> in the 10th cent.</p>

<Author>J. W. Watt</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Apamea</LemmaTitle> 
<p>One of the earliest Hellenistic city foundations in Syria, Apamea, situated on the Orontes ca. 90 km. south of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, from the 2nd cent. onwards was an important center of Middle- and Neo-Platonist philosophy. Both Numenius (late 2nd cent.) and Iamblichus (early 4th cent.) taught here.</p>
<p>In the first half of the 5th cent., the region of Apamea was home to the ascetic circle around <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>. An important bp. of Apamea during Yoḥannan’s lifetime was Polychronius, the brother of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, whose biblical commentaries, written in Greek (not preserved) are sometimes quoted in the later Syriac tradition.</p>
<p>In the late 5th and the 6th cent., Apamea and the province of Syria Secunda, of which it was the capital, became divided between supporters and opponents of the Council of Chalcedon (451). The tension between the two groups can be clearly sensed from the correspondence of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref>, who during his tenure as Patr. (512–18) had difficulty imposing his authority on the diocese. Eventually Syria Secunda was instrumental in bringing about the restoration of Chalcedonian Orthodoxy in the Eastern Empire under the emperors Justin I (518–27) and Justinian (527–65). The Monastery of <ref type="cr">St.</ref> <ref type="cr">Maron</ref>, in the Apamea region (although the exact location is not known), which was perhaps at the head of a confederation of like-minded monasteries, played an important role in these 6th-cent. developments. The Chalcedonian convictions of the monks of Saint Maron gradually became disconnected from Melk. (Byzantine) orthodoxy and, from the 7th cent. onwards, gave rise to the emergence of an independent branch of Chalcedonian Syriac Christianity, which later became known as <ref type="cr">Maronite</ref>. For the Maronites, the Apamea region is their cultural and monastic homeland, from which several centuries later, they transferred their ecclesiastical center to Lebanon.</p>
<p>Apamea had several churches, along with a synagogue (uncovered below one of the churches). Parts of mosaic floors are preserved. While the primary language of Apamea was Greek, an important Syriac inscription, mentioning Bp. Peter of Apamea (and dated to the year 827 ‘in the reckoning of the Apamaeans’, i.e., 515/16) was discovered at Maʿar Zayta (a small town to the southwest of Maʿarrat al-Nuʿmān). At a short distance from Apamea lies the town of Huarte, in which several churches were uncovered, along with a Mithraeum, underneath one of the churches. Some 50 km. north of Apamea is the likely place of origin of the famous <ref type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref>, with their extraordinary illuminations.</p>
<p>Apamea was abandoned in the early Islamic period and later fell into ruins. In 1930, a team of Belgian archeologists started excavating it. Interrupted during World War II, and resumed only in 1965, the excavations during the past several years have been under the direction of J.-Ch. Balty.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Aphrahaṭ</head><ab type="infobox"/>(fl. first half of 4th cent.) 
<p>Syriac author of 23 ‘Demonstrations’, known as ‘the Persian Sage’. The name Aphrahaṭ, by which he is known today, is first found in <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (d. 828). In the early 8th cent. <ref type="cr">Giwargi, bp. of the Arab tribes</ref> only knew of him as ‘the Persian Sage’ (V. Ryssel, <i>Georgs des Araberbischofs Gedichte und Briefe</i> [1891], 44–54), though the oldest ms. of his works (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,182, dated 474) names the author ‘Yaʿqub, the Sage of Persia’. Confirmation of Yaʿqub as his name comes from the early Armenian translation and from the Latin author Gennadius (ca. 500), though both have mistakenly taken him to be bp. <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> (d. 338), which is impossible, since the Demonstrations are provided with exact dates: 1–10 are dated to 336/7, 11–22 to 343/4, and 23 to August 345. They were clearly written in the Persian Empire, and by a person in some sort of authority (the late identification of him as a bp. of <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> is baseless). The first group deals largely with ascetic topics, and Dem. 6–7 are particularly important witnesses to the role of the <ref type="cr">bnay qyāmā</ref> and <ref type="cr">iḥidāye</ref> in the Syriac proto-monastic tradition. Many of the second group concern Judaism and are aimed to combat Judaising tendencies among Christians. The long Dem. 14 stands apart, being described as a letter addressed to the bishops, priests, and people in <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>. Dem. 21 has as its background Shapur II’s persecution. The final Dem. 23 provides a reply to certain questions posed to the author concerning the ‘blessing hidden in the cluster of grapes’ (Isaiah 65:8). The Demonstrations constitute the first major literary work in Syriac: the opening words of Dems. 1–22 provide an alphabetic acrostic, and several Demonstrations contain lengthy passages of carefully balanced artistic prose. Besides their literary interest, the Demonstrations are of great importance for the light they shed on many different topics, in particular: the character of Christianity in the Persian Empire and its ascetic developments, relations with Judaism, the early stages of Shapur’s persecution, and the history of the Syriac biblical text, together with its exegesis and Christology.</p>
<p>The Demonstrations are preserved in four mss., three of which date from the 5th and 6th cent. The 5th-cent. Armenian translation (1–19, attributed to Yaʿqub of Nisibis), was first published in 1756, over a century before the Syriac became known. There are translations of individual Demonstrations into Arabic (parts of 2–4, 6, 9; attributed to <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>), Ethiopic (5, 8; attributed to Yaʿqub of Nisibis), and Georgian (6; attributed to <ref type="cr">Hippolytus</ref>).</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Apocalypses, or Revelations, aim to disclose eschatological events and in order to enhance their authority they are often attributed to past authorities; sometimes it is an angel who makes the disclosure. Such works tend to be produced at times of crises in society.</p>
<p>Two Apocalypses are transmitted in the great Milan ms. of the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> OT (7a1), the ‘Revelation of Baruch’ and ‘The Book of Ezra the Scribe who is called Shelathiel’ (usually referred to as IV Esdras); both are edited (by S. Dedering and R. Bidawid) in <i>Vetus Testamentum Syriace</i> IV.3 (1973). Lections from both works are sometimes found, indicating their quasi-canonical authority. Both Apocalypses are of Jewish origin and are usually dated ca. AD 100; their original language was probably Hebrew. The Revelation of Baruch survives complete only in Syriac and an Arabic translation (ed. F. Leemhuis, A. F. J. Klijn, G. J. H. van Gelder, 1986) made from Syriac (a few fragments only are known in Greek); by contrast, IV  Esdras (confusingly also called II Esdras in modern translations of the Apocrypha/Deuterocanonical books) is also known in Latin, Armenian, Coptic 
(a fragment), Ethiopic, and Georgian; the intermediary Greek, however, is lost.</p>
<p>The NT Apocalypse of John is not part of the Peshitta canon, but two later W.-Syr. translations were subsequently made, one in the 6th cent. (ed. J. Gwynn, 1897, repr. 2005), the other ca. 615, by <ref type="cr">Ṭumo of Ḥarqel</ref> (photographic ed., A. Vööbus, CSCO 400, 1978). Older printed editions of the Peshitta NT include the Ḥarqlean version, while more recent ones give the 6th-cent. version. The book only occasionally received a commentary (notably by <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>).</p>
<p>The Apocalypse of Paul purports to describe what Paul saw when he was raised to the ‘third heaven’ (2 Cor 12:2), and how he was given a tour of both paradise and the place of punishment. The work, which was originally written in Greek (ed. K. Tischendorff, <i>Apocalypses</i> <i>Apocryphae</i> [1866, repr. 1966], 34–69), proved to be immensely popular, and was translated into many languages, including Syriac (ed. G. Ricciotti, in <i>Orientalia</i>2 [1933], 1–25, 120–49; ET by J. Perkins, <i>JAOS</i> 8 [1866], 183–212). It has usually been thought that the earliest form of the Apocalypse goes back to the 3rd cent., and that a ‘second edition’ was later issued, claiming that it had been discovered in a house in Tarsus in 388 (or possibly 420). More recently it has been proposed that the supposed ‘second edition’ was in fact the original form of the Apocalypse. The Syriac translation places the Tarsus narrative at the end, and has a preface by the translator at the beginning. The edition of a variant Syriac version is being prepared by A. Desreumaux. The Coptic Apocalypse of Paul, found at Nag Hammadi is a different work (ed. with FT, J.-M. Rosenthiel, 2005).</p>
<p>The turbulent political events of the 7th cent. gave rise to a number of texts of an apocalyptic nature, this time all composed in Syriac. The Persian invasion of the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire, capturing <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> in 614 and the relic of the Cross, followed eventually by Heraclius’s successful compaigns and recovery of the Cross (630), probably provide the scenario for a poem (transmitted in three different forms) on Alexander the Great ‘and the Gates of the North’, attributed to <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, but evidently composed between 630 and 636 (ed. with GT, G. J. Reinink, CSCO 454–5, 1983; ET in E. A. W. Budge, <i>The History of Alexander the Great</i>[1889, repr. 1976], 163–200). This draws on a christianized form of the <ref type="cr">Alexander</ref> legend from not long before 630 which proved very influential (Budge, <i>History of Alexander</i>, 144–58 [ET], 255–75 [Syr.]).</p>
<p>Another Apocalypse making use of the theme of the ‘Gates of the North’ is the Syriac Apocalypse of Daniel (ed. with ET, M. Henze, 2001; ed. with Esperanto tr., M. Slabczyk, 2000). This work is completely different from the Greek Apocalypses of Daniel; Syriac is clearly its original language and parts of it are parallel with another Syriac apocryphon, the ‘Young Daniel, concerning the End’ (ed. H. Schmold, Ph. D. Diss., Hamburg; 1972). The lack of any indication of contemporary events, prior to ‘the End’, make it difficult to date these works, but the first half of the 
7th cent. seems likely.</p>
<p>A <i>memrā</i> ‘On the End’, wrongly attributed to <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> (<i>Sermo</i> III.5; ed. E. Beck, CSCO 320–1, 1972), which also makes use of the christianized Alexander legend, has been dated to ca. 640, soon after the Arab conquests, though it could alternatively come from a few decades later in the 7th cent. The unrelated Latin sermon ‘on the End’, also attributed to Ephrem, is probably later than the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius.</p>
<p>The Second Civil War (683–92) and the plague of 686–7 gave rise to the inclusion of a number of apocalyptic features in the final book 15 of <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Penkaye</ref>’s ‘Book of the Main Points’, written ca. 687 in north Mesopotamia. The apocalyptic preface to the <ref type="cr">Testament of our Lord</ref>, translated by Yaʿqub (probably, of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>) in 686/7 will also date from that time if the preface was indeed the work of the translator.</p>
<p>The immensely influential <ref type="cr">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</ref>, attributed to the bp. of that name who was martyred in 312 very probably dates from 691/2, the time of ʿAbd al-Malik’s tax reforms and the building of the Dome of the Rock (ed. with GT 
G. J. Reinink, CSCO 540–1, 1993; ET in P. J. Alexander, <i>The Byzantine Apocalyptic Tradition</i>[1985], 36–51; partial ET in A. Palmer, <i>The seventh century in the West-Syriac chronicles</i>[1993], 230–42). This draws on themes found in the <ref type="cr">Cave of Treasures</ref>, the <ref type="cr">Julian Romance</ref>, and the Alexander legend, and foretells, in eschatological terms, the end of Arab rule. Related to Pseudo-Methodius, but from slightly later, is the ‘Edessene Fragment’ (ed. F. Nau, in <i>JA</i> 11.9 [1917], 415–71; ET in Palmer, <i>The seventh century</i>, 243–50); following the example of Pseudo-Methodius, it draws further on the Julian Romance, and also on the legend of Queen Helena and Judas Quryaqos, for its portrayal of the Last World Emperor on Golgotha. The apocalyptic section in the <ref type="cr">Gospel of the Twelve Apostles</ref> attributed to John ‘the Little’, is thought to date from much the same time.</p>
<p>The extended apocalyptic section in the legend of Bḥira (see <ref type="cr">Sargis Bḥira</ref>) probably dates from about the mid-9th cent. in its present form, but its roots may go back to the end of the reign of Maʾmūn (813–33).</p>
<p>‘The Question asked by Ezra in the desert with his disciple Carpus concerning the end of the times of the Ishmaelites’ (ed. with GT, F. Baethgen, in <i>ZAW</i> 6 [1886], 193–211; ed. with FT, J.-B. Chabot, in <i>Revue</i> <i>sémitique</i> 2 [1894], 242–50, 333–46) has been ascribed to many different dates, ranging from the 7th to 11th/12th cent. An Ethiopic version (unpublished) is also known.</p>
<p>The composition of pseudepigraphical apocalypses could also be for the purpose of personal ambition, as is indicated by a passage in <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>’s Chronicle (XI.22) where he tells how Quryaqos bp. of Segestan and Bar Salta of <ref type="cr">Reshʿayna</ref> composed an ‘Apocalypse of Enoch’, foretelling the reign of Marwān (II) and his son, which they presented to Marwān in order to win his support in church affairs.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Aqaq</head><ab type="infobox"/>Acacius (late 5th cent.) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>and Cath. (484–495/6). Aqaq headed the Ch. of E. during a critical period of its history, when it adopted a strictly dyophysite Christology. Aqaq had studied at the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref>, where he became acquainted with the works of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. Among his fellow students were <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref> and <ref type="cr">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref>. Aqaq’s predecessor, Cath. Babowai, who had a strained relationship with Barṣawma, had also come into conflict with the Persian Emperor Peroz and was arrested and executed by the latter in 484. When Aqaq took office, therefore, the situation of Christianity in the Persian Empire was extremely precarious. Our main source for the history of his period is the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. There is no evidence of Aqaq’s involvement in a synod held in <ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref> in April 484. This may have been a limited synod of Barṣawma’s followers, of which no report is transmitted (and which Barṣawma himself later revoked). It was in the wake of this synod that Babowai was arrested and executed, and replaced by Aqaq. At a subsequent synod, held in Beth ʿEdray, in August-September 485 (of which also no report is preserved), peace between Barṣawma and Aqaq was established. A number of letters from this period, included in the Synodicon, confirm that Barṣawma and his followers eventually submitted to Aqaq. The stage was thus set for the Synod of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, of Febr. 486, in which a unified church, under Aqaq’s leadership, adopted dyophysite Christology. Additionally, measures were taken to restrain the (excessive) influence of ascetics outside their monasteries and to make marriage the preferred status for all clergy, including bishops, celibacy being relegated only to monasteries. The specific context of these measures is not yet clear. Should they be understood in response to ideas prevailing in the Zoroastrian society, or as reactions to over-active wandering monks, who also may have propagated Miaphysitism among Persian Christians? Apart from the information in the Synodicon, very little is known about Aqaq. The Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref> attributes to him a treatise ‘On faith’, written against the Miaphysites, and three discourses on fasting, none of which is preserved. The Chronicle also reports that Aqaq translated into Persian a treatise on the Christian faith by <ref type="cr">Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye</ref>, which was presented to the Persian emperor Qawad.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Arabic, Syriac translations from 
</LemmaTitle><p>Translation from Syriac into Arabic is a well-known phenomenon. This is especially true for the translations of philosophical and scientific works that were made in the first Abbasid period by <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> and others, which have been the object of significant scholarly research (see, e.g., Bergsträsser). Much less attention has, however, been paid to the opposite phenomenon: translations from Arabic into Syriac. It has even been suggested (by <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> in his discussions with the vizier al-Maghribī) that the absence of such translations are proof of the superiority of Syriac science and culture. As a matter of fact, however, the Syrians already had translations from Arabic some time before Eliya. One may distinguish six different, unrelated fields:</p>
<p>1. The earliest category consists of ascetical and hagiographic material related to the life and spirituality of the monks from the Egyptian desert. Though most of these Syriac texts were translated from a Greek original (e.g the apophthegmata by <ref type="cr">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>), at least a few seem to have had an Arabic original, which in its turn goes back to a Coptic Vorlage: a panegyric on John the Small by a monk of <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> and the biography of Shenute by his disciple Besa (10th cent.).</p>
<p>2. The second field covers a few writings pertaining to Syriac entertainment literature, such as the stories of <ref type="cr">Kalila and Dimna</ref> (11th cent., by an E.-Syr. priest, in addition to an earlier Syriac version made from Pahlavi in the 7th cent.), ‘<ref type="cr">Sindbad</ref> the wise’, and the tale of the ‘Ten viziers and the son of King Azad-Bekht’.</p>
<p>3. The next category is constituted by medical texts of Greek origin, which were translated in the first Abbasid period. Though in most cases these texts were translated directly from the Greek original into Syriac (which served as the basis of a subsequent Arabic translation), there are a few instances in which Arabic served as the intermediary between Greek and Syriac. Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq mentions that his co-religionist Yūḥannā b. Māsawayh, the private physician of several caliphs, requested that Ḥunayn’s nephew Ḥubaysh translate into Syriac three medical works by <ref type="cr">Galen</ref>, which were already available in an Arabic version. We may assume that the reason behind this request was that the very critical Ibn Māsawayh held that Syriac was more appropriate than Arabic for expressing scientific idioms. A Syriac version of Ḥunayn’s Arabic treatise <i>al-Masā</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>il al-ṭibbiyya</i>‘Book of medical questions’ is preserved in some late Chald. mss., through there is no information about the translator (for discussion, see Teule, forthcoming).</p>
<p>4. <ref type="cr">Bar</ref> ʿ<ref type="cr">Ebroyo</ref> had a good knowledge of Muslim-Arabic literature. Many of his works can be characterized as sometimes literal, sometimes paraphrastic translations/adaptations of Arabic philosophical and religious writings, such as the ‘Ethicon’ and the ‘Book of the Dove’ (based on Ghazālī), the <i>Swād supyā</i> (based on Ibn Sinā), etc. In these cases, however, the author did not intend to make translations, and the origin of the source text was not revealed. Nevertheless, Bar ʿEbroyo did also compose several translations that were meant as such: the <i>Kitāb al-išārāt wa-al-tanbīhāt</i> by Ibn Sīna (Syriac <i>Ktobo d-remze wa-mʿironwoto d-Abu ʿ<i>Ali bar Sīnā</i>), in which he acknowledges the authorship of Ibn Sīnā and does justice to the Islamic context of this work, Athīr al-Dīn al-Abharī’s <i>Zubdat al-Asrār</i> (lost), and possibly Ibn Sinā’s ‘Medical Canon’. Bar ʿEbroyo’s translation activities are to be understood in the context of the growing acceptance of Muslim cultural and religious influences characteristic of the so-called <ref type="cr">Syriac Renaissance</ref>.</p>
<p>In Bar ʿEbroyo’s writings, one can also find several quotations (in Syriac) from verses of the Qurʾān. We have no certainty about a complete Syriac translation of this work, but <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>gives literal translations of several <i>sūra</i>s in his ‘Treatise against the Muslims’.</p>
<p>5. The most important category is composed of theological writings translated from Latin or other European languages into Arabic by Western missionaries (16th cent. and later) with the help of local Christians, which served as the basis for new translations into Syriac. Examples are the <i>Maḥzitā mriqtā</i> ‘the Polished Mirror’ by the Chald. Patr. <ref type="cr">Yawsep II</ref> (d. 1713), a Uniate apologetic treatise, translated by himself, in defense of the Primacy of the Pope, and the ‘Book of the Magnet’, a popular book of moral theology. The reason for these translations was that the Christian population under the authority of Yawsep II (Northern Mesopotamia) did not have sufficient knowledge of Arabic. This is explicitly mentioned by the Chald. priest Khidr from <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> 
(d. 1751), who translated into Syriac Arabic versions of European works or original Arabic treatises composed by Maron. or Syr. Catholic authors. The priest Yawsep Abraham from Rāwandūz (1832) translated the <i>Mizān al-zamān</i> ‘the Balance of Time’ an originally Italian work, which was popular in Uniate circles, as well as some other theological and spiritual treatises. He also made a Syriac translation (from Arabic) of the NT Catholic Letters. An Arabic work by the zealous defender of the Uniate cause, the Melk. author ʿAbdallāh Zākhir (d. 1748) is also extant in a Syriac translation, probably made in Mesopotamia (on the Trinity and Incarnation). This translation activity from Arabic substantially diminished in the 
19th cent., when the Chald. clergy had direct access to Latin and Italian theological writings.</p>
<p>6. Some modern works written by authors like Bp. <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon Dolabani</ref> or Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius Afram Barsoum</ref>(especially his history of Syriac literature, translated into Syriac under the title <i>Brule bdire</i>) were translated from Arabic into Syriac.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Aramaic 
</LemmaTitle><p>The Aramaic language belongs to the Northwest Semitic subfamily within the larger family of Semitic languages. To the same subfamily belong among others Hebrew, Phoenician, and Ugaritic. Aramaic itself consists of a great number of language forms (and indeed languages), spoken and written in many different scripts over a period of 3000 years. Aramaic always co-existed and interacted with other, related or non-related, languages. Among the Aramaic languages <ref type="cr">Syriac</ref> is by far the best documented language. Geographically, Aramaic first was used in various locations of the ‘Fertile Crescent’, in Syria and Mesopotamia. It later spread all over the Middle East and well into Central Asia. From the 6th cent. BC to the 7th cent. AD, Aramaic, in a variety of interrelated language forms, or ‘dialects’, was the most widespread language of the Middle East, co-existing first with Old Persian (6th–4th cent. BC), and then with Greek (3rd  cent. BC – 7th cent. AD), and Middle Persian (3rd– 
7th cent. AD). Under the dominance of Arabic and Islam, Aramaic lived on among various religious minorities, Syriac Christianity being the most important among them. In the third millennium AD, Aramaic and Syriac are used by a few million people — Christians, Jews, Samaritans, and Mandaeans — in liturgy, literature, and/or in spoken dialects in the Middle East, Southern India, and the worldwide diasporas.</p>
<p>Various scholarly attempts have been made at classifying the Aramaic languages. One among them, first proposed by J. Fitzmyer, and slightly adapted by S. Kaufman among others, has become widely used. It is based on a five-fold division of Aramaic linguistic history.</p>
<p>1. Old Aramaic (ca. 900 – ca. 600 BC). Aramaic was used by semi-autonomous <ref type="cr">Aramean</ref> tribes in Syria, Palestine, and Mesopotamia. Royal and funerary inscriptions of the <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> region exhibit a relatively, but not entirely, unified language in the Phoenician sphere of influence, while the bilingual inscription of the Tell Fakhariyya statue (northeast Syria) points to an Akkadian linguistic and cultural context. The script is nearly identical to the one found in the Phoenician inscriptions, from which it was borrowed.</p>
<p>2. Imperial, or Official Aramaic (ca. 600 – ca. 200 BC). Already in the later days of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (following the loss of independence of the Aramean city states), Aramaic began to be used for trade and communication. The expansion of Aramaic went on in the Neo-Babylonian Empire and culminated in the ‘official’ status that Aramaic achieved (along with Persian and Elamite) in the Achaemenid Persian Empire 
(mid-6th cent. – 330 BC). Along with inscriptions, a great number of texts on papyrus, parchment, and ostraca have been unearthed in Egypt. They evidence the use of Aramaic in official documents issued by, and addressed to, the Persian administration, in correspondence of a more private character, and in literary compositions. The Aramaic documents in the biblical book of Ezra and their narrative framework represent the same type of language. The official use of Aramaic implied that there was a certain linguistic and orthographical standard, even if individual texts often deviated from it. This standard remained authoritative for several centuries after the fall of the Persian Empire. Its literary variant has been called ‘Standard Literary Aramaic’.</p>
<p>3. Middle Aramaic (ca. 200 BC – ca. 250 AD). First, there is the continued use of the earlier standardized language, in such texts as the Aramaic chapters of the biblical book of Daniel, the Aramaic portions of the Dead Sea documents, and the earliest layer of the Jewish Targumim, or translations of the Hebrew Bible (Targum Onkelos for the Pentateuch and Targum Jonathan for the Prophets). Second, there are corpora of Aramaic inscriptions, produced in the Nabataean Empire (which had Petra as its capital), and in the city states of Ḥaṭra, Palmyra, and <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. These lost their independence in the 2nd and 3rd cent. AD. The languages of these places each slightly differ from one another and they are written in slightly different scripts, derived from the script used in the Persian period. Nabataean Aramaic exhibits features that are due to contact with Old North Arab­ian, which was widely spoken throughout the Nabatean Empire.</p>
<p>4. Late Aramaic (3rd cent. to ca. 1200 AD). From this period literary texts are preserved which received classical status in at least four different religious communities. At the same time, a clear distinction emerges between West-Aramaic and East-Aramaic dialects.</p>
<p>West-Aramaic texts were produced by Jews (Palestinian Targumim, Aramaic portions in the Palestinian Talmud and in the Midrashim, Aramaic compositions preserved among the Cairo Genizah documents  — many of the texts mentioned represent the Galilean Aramaic dialect), Samaritans (Targumim, hymns, and prose compositions); and Christians of the Jerusalem area (<ref type="cr">Christ­ian Palestinian Aramaic</ref>).</p>
<p>East-Aramaic texts were produced by Jews (parts of the Babylonian Talmud and Gaonic literature), Mandaeans (classical Mandaic literature), and Christians (Syriac). The status of Syriac has been somewhat disputed. While Syriac traditionally has been considered the westernmost of the East-Aramaic languages, some scholars now tend to classify it as a separate branch of late Aramaic. The language of <ref type="cr">Mani</ref> and of the early Manicheans must have been close to Syriac, but next to nothing has survived.</p>
<p>Jewish Aramaic texts are written in the Hebrew square script, which itself is an adaptation of the earlier Aramaic script. Samaritan Aramaic is written in a separate script, which derives from the earlier Hebrew script. Christian-Palestinian Aramaic is written in a <ref type="cr">script</ref> that is related to Esṭrangela, and Mandaic has its own script, likely derived from the Parthian/Late Iranian scripts. An interesting genre that existed across religious borders is that of the incantations written on ‘magic bowls’: texts that are very similar exist in Jewish (Babylonian) Aramaic, Mandaic, and Syriac (written either in Esṭrangela or in a different script, which has been called ‘Proto-Manichean’).</p>
<p>Each of these languages had its heyday in the pre-Islamic period, when the literary languages to a large extent reflected, and were nourished by, the spoken languages. In the Islamic period, when Arabic became more prominent, the literary languages gradually became disconnected from the waning spoken dialects, which survived in geographical and social isolation.</p>
<p>5. Modern Aramaic, or Neo-Aramaic (to the present day). While the classical languages, shaped and standardized in the previous period, continued to be transmitted and written — and do so up to the present day  — the spoken variants started having their own history, much of which went unrecorded. It is only in the 17th cent. that some dialects began to be written for the first time. This happened in Northern Iraq with Modern Jewish Aramaic and with Modern Syriac (see <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref>), which was written in and around <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref>. In the 19th cent., under the impulse of American missionaries, a new literary language was created for the Christians of <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref> and its surroundings. First used for a new translation of the Bible, Literary Urmia Aramaic later was adapted and upgraded to serve as the vehicle of the <ref type="cr">Assyrian</ref> identity. As such it is still used today among E.-Syr. Christians in the Middle East and in the worldwide <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref>.</p>
<p>The modern spoken dialects are generally subdivided as follows:</p>
<p>a. West-Neo-Aramaic, spoken in Maʿlula and in a few neighboring villages to the north of Damascus by Christians (Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic) and by some Muslims. This language may be seen as an offshoot of West-Aramaic, described under 4. Some texts are available in contemporary scholarly transliterations.</p>
<p>b. Central-Neo-Aramaic, of which the main dialect is <ref type="cr">Ṭuroyo</ref>, spoken in <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿ</i>Abdin</ref>, mainly by Syr. Orth. Christians. The language is now widespread among the Syr. Orth diaspora. There have been a few attempts to write it down, most successfully among the Swedish communities (in Latin script).</p>
<p>c. North-East-Neo-Aramaic, spoken to the east of the Tigris, in Eastern Turkey, Persian Kurdistan, and Northern Iraq (north of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>) by both Christians and Jews. Due to massive relocation throughout the 20th cent., originally distinct languages have been mixed and cases of Koine formation have emerged. Here again, many speakers live in the diaspora; Jewish Aramaic lives on in Israel.</p>
<p>d. South-East-Neo-Aramaic, represented by much endangered Mandaic dialects, spoken in southern Iraq and western Iran.</p>
<p>Each of these many modern dialects carries its own cultural and religious tradition. Linguistically they share a number of features, particularly in the radical transformation of the verbal system. In the lexicon, many loanwords were borrowed from the surrounding languages along with phonetic, morphological, and syntactical features.</p>
<p>In the Syriac tradition the term <i>ārām</i><i>āyā</i> (<i>oromoyo</i>) is often used, along with <i>suryāyā</i> (<i>suryoyo</i>), to denote the Syriac language. Syriac rewriting of texts originally composed in other Aramaic languages may be found in the Aramaic sections of the Old Testament and in such texts as the story of <ref type="cr">Aḥiqar</ref>. An awareness of an Aramean unity, based on the language (<i>leššān</i><i>ā</i> / <i>lešono</i>) and the written tradition (<i>seprā</i> / <i>sepro</i>), extending from the first Chaldean and Assyrian kings to the Christian Syrians, can be found in the second Appendix added to the Chronicle of 
<ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, which deals with ‘the kingdoms that have been established in Antiquity by our race, (that of) the Arameans, namely the descendants of Aram, who were called Syrians or inhabitants of Syria’ (ed. J. B. Chabot, text in vol. 4, 748–51 ; FT in vol. 3, 442–7). Among the present-day Syr. Christians the Aramaic heritage is particularly emphasized by the Syr. Orth.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Arameans feature in the annals of the Assyrian kings for some four centuries (ca. 1100–700 BC), apparently having settled more or less all around the Fertile Crescent; the geographical term <ref type="cr">Beth Aramaye</ref> in Syriac sources reflects their presence in Babylonia as recorded in the Assyrian annals. In the course of the 10th cent. BC a number of small independent Aramean kingdoms, using <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> in their inscriptions, emerged in what is today Syria, though over the course of the next two centuries they all became subject to the Assyrian Empire, a fate shared with Israel and Judah. The often hostile relations between the Aramean kings and those of Israel and Judah are related in the OT (Kings and Chron.). Syriac readers of the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>, however, would have known these (with the exception of Rezin) as ‘Edomites’, rather than ‘Arameans’, since the Syriac translators evidently thought that the Arameans lived only to the East of the Euphrates (thus Laban remains an ‘Aramean’, Gen. 31:20). In the Peshitta NT, by contrast, ‘Aramean’ renders ‘Hellene’ in the sense of ‘gentile, pagan’ (e.g. Acts 21:28; Rom. 1:16). At some point a distinction was introduced between the two senses, ethnic (<i>ārāmāyā</i>) and pagan (<i>armāyā</i>); the first definite attestation for the latter is in a <i>memrā</i> by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (ed. Bedjan, V, 474) where the three-syllable form is demanded by the meter (<i>armāyā</i> is the vocalization that is later provided for all the NT passages).</p>
<p>In many Syriac writers <i>Ārāmāyā</i> and <i>Suryāyā</i> are synonyms; normally this refers to the language, but on occasion they are used as alternate ethnic terms: thus in the early Syriac translation of <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref>’s ‘Ecclesiastical History’ <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref> is described both as a <i>suryāyā</i> (ed. Wright, 183) and as an <i>ārāmāyā</i> (243). Likewise <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, in his ‘Encheiridion’ and elsewhere, speaks of ‘we Suryāye, or Ārāmāye’. This equation is further elaborated in Appendix II to <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>’s Chronicle. In modern times the ethnic identity of ‘Aramean’ has been taken up in some circles of the W.-Syr. <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref> as a corrective to the popularity of <ref type="cr">Assyrian</ref> themes.</p>

<p>Capital of modern Kurdistan, in eastern Iraq. It was already inhabited in the 4th millennium BC; in the oldest cuneiform texts it is called <i>Urbilum</i> (Assyrian <i>Arba</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>ilu</i>). One of the stations along the royal road between Sardes and Persepolis, it was a cultic center, with a temple devoted to the fertility goddess Ishtar, as well as a center of commerce and a main point on the caravan routes. It was held successively by the Babylonians, Persians, and Greeks, and it was very near Arbela that Darius III was defeated by Alexander the Great (331 BC). It was during Alexander’s rule that the country surrounding Arbela became known as <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref> (Syr. <i>Ḥadyāb</i>), which later became part of the Parthian Empire, and eventually a governor’s seat during the Sasanian period. In the 1st cent. AD, Adiabene became an independent kingdom, subject to the Parthian king, but it remained on the periphery of the battle zone between Rome and Parthia. It was in Adiabene, according to <ref type="cr">Josephus</ref>, that the royal family converted to Judaism in the 1st cent. AD.</p>
<p>Arbela was christianized at a very early date and its inhabitants quickly became the victims of persecution by the local governor. The history of its Christian beginnings is recounted in the Chronicle of Arbela, a late and dubious mélange of biographical sketches of the twenty early bishops of Arbela (ca. 104–511). According to this Chronicle, Pekhida, a disciple of Addai, became the first bp.; during the tenure of Isḥaq, the third bp., the first church in Arbela was built. The Chronicle also bears testimony — and this may be the most historical witness of this text — that many of Arbela’s bishops and faithful suffered martyrdom at the hands of the Persians. The <ref type="cr">Acts of Mari</ref>, a seemingly more reliable source, claims rather that Aggai and Mari, missionaries from <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, were the first evangelists of Adiabene, and its first bps. Arbela was for some time the metropolitan seat of the region of Adiabene, and boasted of several important figures as bishops — of whom three later became patriarchs  — who appear in the signatory lists of the synods of the Ch. of E. A Christian school located in Arbela also produced a number of important monastic figures and bps. In 1295, a second Mongol invasion destroyed the Christian churches, killed many Christians, and drove the surviving Christians into other regions. Subsequent persecutions were sufficiently harsh that, by the end of the 17th cent., there were no remaining Christians in Arbela; small groups had begun to re-immigrate in the early part of the 20th cent.</p>

<p>Greek Philosopher. In Late Antiquity the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle were considered to be in harmony, and not in conflict; accordingly the syllabus for studying philosophy began with Aristotle (commencing with his logical works, the ‘Organon’, or ‘Tool’), leaving Plato to the climax. This accounts for the fact that the early books of the ‘Organon’ (‘Categories’, ‘On Interpretation’, and ‘Prior Analytics’ [at first only to I.7]) were the first works of Aristotle to be translated (along with <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Introduction’), and it is only these that actually survive, although there is evidence that much more was translated; it also accounts for the fact that no genuine works by Plato were ever translated into <ref type="cr">Syriac</ref>.</p>
<p>The Syriac translations fall into three main periods: 1. the earliest, anonymous, translations probably belonging to the early 6th cent.; these survive, and are confined to the early books of the ‘Organon’; 2. the 7th- and early 8th-cent. revisions by <ref type="cr">Athanasios of Balad</ref>, <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>, several of which survive; the later books of the ‘Organon’ were also translated by Athanasios, but these are no longer extant; Ya<ref type="cr">ʿ</ref>qub evidently knew the ‘Metaphysics’, but that work appears never to have been translated into Syriac; 3. further revisions and new translations made in the course of the ‘translation movement’ patronised by the Abbasid caliphs; the new translations also included many other works, beyond the ‘Organon’ (see Peters); hardly any of these survive in their original form, since they were usually made just to serve as the basis for further translation into Arabic; some use of them, however, was made by <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> in his ‘Cream of Wisdom’ and elsewhere.</p>
<p>The earliest Syriac commentators, (for whom, see Hugonnard-Roche, <i>La logique</i>, 123–291), <ref type="cr">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref>, <ref type="cr">Proba</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Pawlos the Persian</ref>, all belong to the early or mid-6th cent. (on internal evidence the 5th-cent. date sometimes given to Proba cannot be correct). In the 7th cent. <ref type="cr">Severos Sebokht</ref> wrote on syllogisms, while Athanasios of Balad wrote an Introduction to Aristotelian logic, and Ya<ref type="cr">ʿ</ref>qub of Edessa provided an ‘Encheiridion’ of philosophical terms. Giwargi’s revision of the first three books of the Organon (including the whole of the ‘Prior Analytics’) is accompanied by introductions to a number of the books, as well as annotation. E.-Syr. authors from <ref type="cr">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref> and <ref type="cr">Babai</ref> onwards also show an awareness of Aristotle’s logical works, and writings dealing with topics in the ‘Organon’ by <ref type="cr">Michael Badoqa</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ishoʿbokht</ref>, <ref type="cr">Silwanos of Qardu</ref> (who knows all the books of the ‘Organon’; CSCO 464, p. 35), <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>, and others survive, but no specific commentaries are preserved. A glimpse at the translation movement in action is given by <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> in his Letters 43 and 48, on translating the ‘Topics’. From the late 12th cent. a commentary reaching the ‘Analytics’ by <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> survives (ms. Cambridge Gg. 2.14). In the early 13th cent. both <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref> and <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref> (in his ‘Dialogues’) are concerned with related topics; a little later Bar ʿEbroyo, in his <i>Ktobo d-boboto</i> covers in brief the whole of the ‘Organon’, while his ‘Cream of Wisdom’ serves as a general compendium of almost all aspects of Aristotelian philosophy.</p>
<p>Besides two short biographies (ed. Baumstark, 
<i>Aristoteles</i>, 2*–3*), a number of works falsely under 
Aristotle’s name were also translated into Syriac, the most notable being the <i>Peri</i> <i>Kosmou</i> (‘On the universe’; ed. de Lagarde, <i>Analecta</i> <i>Syriaca</i> , 134–58), translated by Sergios of Reshʿayna. Although it was once thought that the Arabic Neoplatonist work known as the ‘Theology of Aristotle’ was translated from a lost Syriac text, this is now considered improbable.</p>

<Author>G. A. Kiraz</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Armenian Christianity, Syriac contacts with
</LemmaTitle><p>Armenia, the geographical area of Armenian Christianity and culture, borders the homeland of Syr. Christianity. For centuries, <ref type="cr">Arameans</ref> and Armenians lived together in parts of northern Mesopotamia and northern Syria. The main cities of Syr. Christianity, <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>(Armenian <i>U</i><i>ṙ</i><i>hay</i>) and <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>(Armenian <i>Mcbin</i>) had a mixed population, which included Syrians and Armenians. Within the Sasanian Empire, the lines of demarcation between the 
Ch. of E. and the Armenian Church were very porous. The E.-Syr. ecclesiastical province of <ref type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>, which since the synod of <ref type="cr">Isḥaq</ref> (410) had Nisibis as its metropolitan see, included the dioceses of Arzun, Qardu, Beth Zabdai, Beth Rahimai, and Beth Moksaye, which all had large Armenian populations and which occasionally show up as dioceses of the Armenian Church. In these and in other borderlands, there must have been a significant amount of bilingualism, reflecting a ‘veritable interpenetration’ between the two groups (Garsoïan 1992, 63).</p>
<p><LemmaTitle>In the 1st cent. BC, the western part of Armenia was incorporated into the Roman Empire, while the larger part (‘Great Armenia’) remained within the Iranian sphere of influence, at times enjoying independence, at times ruled by Parthian and later Sasanian monarchs. Around 387 the Roman and Sasanian Empires agreed on a formal partition of Armenia (even though the frontier subsequently shifted). Despite the fact that in its formative period Armenian Christianity, not unlike Syr. Christianity, was divided over two empires, this did not lead — as in the case of the Syrians — to doctrinal division. This is often attributed to a stronger sense of ethnic and cultural identity among the Armenians than among the Syrians. In the Islamic period Armenians occasionally had their own kingdom, such as under the Bagratid dynasty, from the end of the 9th to the middle of the 11th cent. From the late 12th cent. to 1375, an independent Armenian kingdom existed in Cilicia (‘Little Armenia’), where many Armenians had settled. Cilician Armenia accepted union with Rome at the Council of Sis in 1307, but this union, which failed to receive support outside Cilicia, came to an end with the demise of the Cilician kingdom. In the Ottoman Empire, Armenians at first flourished. The patriarchate of Constantinople (Istanbul) was created to represent Armenian interests (and often other Christians’ interests as well) at the capital. Armenians also lived in parts of Persia and Russia, and there were diaspora communities as far as Lemberg (Galicia, present-day Lwow in Poland). Significant emigration to Europe and North America started in the middle of the 19th  cent. The early 20th cent. saw the Armenian genocide, which largely coincided with the</LemmaTitle><ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref><LemmaTitle>, and which was followed by further dispersion. The short-lived independent Armenian Republic (1918–
1920) became part of the Soviet Union in 1920, to regain its independence only in September 1991.</p>
</LemmaTitle><p>Christianity came to Armenia no later than the 3rd cent. and the Armenian Church was first organized by Gregory the Illuminator in the early 4th cent. An important factor in the development of Armenian Christianity was the invention of the Armenian script by Maštoc‘ (Mesrop), traditionally dated in or around 407, and preceded by Maštoc‘’s travels through Syria and Edessa. This was followed by a period of intense translation activity, from both Greek and Syriac. Prior to the invention of their own script, Armenians used Greek and Syriac as their literary and liturgical languages.</p>
<p>Among the translations of the earliest period (first half of the 5th cent.) are several Syriac texts, such as the Demonstrations of <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, transmitted in Armenian under the name of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> (ed. Lafontaine), several works by <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>(Armenian: Ephrem Asori ‘the Assyrian’ or ‘Syrian’), and a short treatise attributed to bp. <ref type="cr">Aitalaha</ref> of Edessa, which is not preserved in Syriac. Ephrem’s Armenian works include the undoubtedly genuine ‘Hymns on Nicomedia’, which were written shortly after 358, and of which only a few Syriac fragments exist (ed. Renoux), and the Commentary on the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref> (ed. Leloir). While for these two works (as well as for Aphrahaṭ) we are dealing with quite faithful translations of Syriac originals, the relationship to the Syriac original is more problematic for other works attributed to Ephrem, such as a collection of hymns (ed. Mariès and Mercier), which seem to contain Syriac materials, but may represent later rewritings, and an anti-Marcionite exposition of the Gospel (ed. Egan), which is probably not by Ephrem (see Bundy, against the view of the editor), even though a 4th-cent. Syriac original is very likely. In addition to the translations of originally Syriac works, some Greek patristic works were translated into Armenian not from Greek, but from an earlier Syriac translation. The two most well-known examples are <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History and <ref type="cr">Basil of Caesarea</ref>’s Homilies on the Hexaemeron. In the earliest layers of Armenian biblical and liturgical texts as well, the mark of Armenia’s early contacts with the Syriac world is clearly visible. Among indigenous Armenian authors who are well informed about Syriac Christianity and write about it or borrow themes or interpretations from it are Eznik of Kołb (author of a work known as either ‘Against the sects’ or ‘On God’), Koriwn (author of ‘The Life of Maštoc‘’), the author of the ‘Teaching of Gregory’ (incorporated into the ‘History of Agathangelos’), and the author of the ‘Epic histories’ (formerly known as Faustus of Byzantium).</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council’s condemnation of Antiochene theo­logy, Armenian Christianity moved away from the Syriac sphere of influence and increasingly turned to the Greek imperial church. The Council of Chalcedon (451) at first did not have an impact on the Armenians, who at the same time were involved in the Battle of Avarayr (the outcome of which led to full Sasanian rule over Armenia). It is only in the course of the 6th cent. that church leaders and councils determined Armenia’s own theological position, partly in response to missionary activity carried out by representatives of the emerging Syr. Mia­physite Church and of the Dyophysite E.-Syr. Church. Even though the Armenians repeatedly took a position against dyophysitism, associated with <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref> as well as with the Ch. of E., a straightforward rejection of the Council of Chalcedon only took place at the Council of Dvin in 607. From the 6th-cent. documents of the Armenian church (preserved in the ‘Book of Letters’) it appears that, in contrast with the Syr. Orth. and Coptic Miaphysite churches, the works of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> did not obtain normative status in Armenia, but rather that a form of aphthartodocetism gradually became the official doctrine (regarding the body of Christ as inherently incorruptible). The question of whether this was associated with <ref type="cr">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref> (whose works seem not to have been translated into Armenian), Severus’s opponent, or whether this had different roots and was nourished perhaps by the writings of <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>, some of which were translated into Armenian (see Ter-Minassiantz, 147–51, and more recently Cowe), has not yet been fully settled. Due to this different orientation within the Miaphysite tradition, there was always some distance between the Armenian Orth. and the Syr. Orth. Church, and occasionally some tension (Ter-­Minassiantz). A list of historical complaints of the Syrians against the Armenians is found in treatises by <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon X bar Shushan</ref> and <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>.</p>
<p>In spite of the theological complexities in their relationship, contacts and exchanges between Syr. and Armenian Christians continued throughout the centuries. In the early Islamic period, both the Ch. of E. and the Syr. Orth. Church had a presence in parts of the Armenian lands. Since the 8th cent., there was in Khilat (or Akhlat), on the western shore of Lake Van, an E.-Syr. metropolitan bp. as well as a Syr. Orth. bp. (Fiey 2003, 1427), while an E.-Syr. bp. also is attested for Bardaʿa (Armenian Partaw), on the Terter River (Van Lantschoot 1932). The E.-Syr. metropolitan see of Khilat was later given up as an independent see and added to Nisibis, whose metropolitan bp. in the 13th cent. had ‘Nisibis and Armenia’ in his title (Fiey, <i>Nisibe</i>, 106). Translation activity from Syriac into Armenian went on. For example, some of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>’s exegetical work found its way into an Armenian commentary attributed to Ephrem (ed. Mathews), and the 9th-cent. Commentary on the Gospel of John by <ref type="cr">Nonos of Nisibis</ref> is preserved only in Armenian.</p>
<p>Intense contacts on all levels took place in the period of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Many Syrians must have settled in the relative safety of Cilicia, where the Syr. Orth. had bp. sees in Adana, Anazarba (ʿAyn Zarba), Sis (patriarchal residence between 1292 and the early 15th cent.), and Tarsus. There were Syr. Orth. monasteries in Cilicia as well, in particular those of Gawikat (or Kawikhat) and Paksimeṭ (or Baksimeṭ). <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, in his Chronicle, provides a wealth of information on Armenian history; in addition, one of the appendices to the Chronicle (no. 5) explicitly deals with the Armenians. Of Michael’s Chronicle two different translations were produced, one in 1246, by the Armenian author Vardan Arewelc‘i in collaboration with the Edessene monk Yeshuʿ (of Ḥeṣno d-Kifo, see Barsoum), the other in 1248 by Vardan alone (possibly after Yeshuʿ’s death). The translation was made from Michael’s autograph, which along with other mss. had been transferred from the <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref> to Hṙomklay (Qalʿa Rumayta), where the Syr. Orth Patr. Ignatius Dawid resided for some time and where a Syr. Orth. church had been built. Both translations present a periphrastic and much shortened version of Michael’s Chronicle (Schmidt 1996). Other translations from Syriac made in Cilician Armenia include the ‘Syro-Roman Lawbook’ and the ‘Sententiae Syriacae’ (see <ref type="cr">Juridical literature</ref>); homilies by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (Weitenberg, 349 and 350); the Psalm Commentary by <ref type="cr">Daniel of Ṣalaḥ</ref>; and several works of medical content. 
A unique work on horse-medicine (written ca. 1300) was translated from Arabic, but the author explicitly identifies himself as a veterinary of Syrian descent and creed. Translations typically resulted from the collaboration of an Armenian and a Syriac native speaker (Weitenberg, with further references). While all the examples quoted here concern Syriac writings translated into Armenian, an interesting case of a Syrian author’s interest in Armenian may be seen in <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s biblical commentaries, which in particular in the commentary on Psalms contain about 160 quotations of, or references to, the Armenian Bible (Göttsberger). The fall of the Cilician kingdom (1375) brought the close contacts between the Armenian and Syr. Orth. intellectual elite to an end, even though for the subsequent centuries further evidence exists of the ongoing interaction between Syriac and Armenian Christians (see, e.g., Kaufhold).</p>
<p>Among the cities in which Armenians and Syrians lived together for many centuries, Edessa assumes a special position. The Armenian presence there can be traced back to a very early period and some sources (including Yaʿqub of Edessa, in his Chronicle) present king Abgar and the original population of Edessa as Armenian. The story of Abgar’s conversion to Christianity became widely popular in Armenian, whereby an increasing Armenization took place, from its first attestation in Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History and the 5th-cent. work attributed to Labubna, or Łerubna (the Edessene king’s scribe who is also mentioned in the Syr. <ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref>) to the rewritten versions in Moses Xorenac‘i’s ‘History of the Armenians’ (probably 9th cent.) and the 10th-cent. historians Thomas Arcruni and Uxtanes. When the short-lived Crusade principality of Edessa fell to the Seljuks in 1144, the Armenians were bewildered as much as the Syr. Christians were (see Dionysios bar Ṣalibi), as is shown by the lament written by Nerses Shnorhali (ET van Lint), the later Cath. of all Armenians (1166–99), who is known for his friendly relationship with Michael Rabo.</p>
<p>The contacts between Armenian and Syr. Christians are also reflected in art, as is illustrated in the 
9th-cent. illuminated Gospel ms. of Queen Mlke (Venice, San Lazzaro 1144), which has been connected with the Syriac <ref type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref> (Stone et al.).</p>
<p>For the more recent period (16th–18th cent.) a number of Syriac-Armenian lexica are attested, reflecting language contact and bilingualism. Both within these lexica and outside of them, interesting examples of boundary crossing between the two langauges are found in Armenian texts written in Syriac script and in (at least) one Syriac text written in Armenian script (Van Lantschoot 1964, Brock, Schmidt 2007, Takahashi and Weitenberg [forthcoming]).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Art and architecture
</LemmaTitle><p>A comprehensive study of Syr. Christian art and architecture is still missing, and only a few subfields are relatively well covered in overview monographs, such as the architecture of Syria west of the Euphrates (Butler; Lassus; Tchalenko), floor mosaics in churches of Syria and Lebanon (Donceel-Voûte), manuscript illumination (Leroy 1964), and wall paintings in Syria and Lebanon (Cruikshank Dodd; Immerzeel 2009). Given Syr. Christianity’s intertwinement, throughout its history, with other linguistic, cultural, and religious traditions, the definition of what constitutes ‘Syr. Christian’ art or architecture is somewhat elusive and should not be attempted here. In the early period much of Syr. Christianity was situated in the Roman Empire, in which there was a great deal of overlap between Syr. Christian and Greek Christian art and culture. In the Islamic period certain forms of art were shared between Syr. Christians and Muslims. In addition, the proximity of Byzantine Christianity or even Western Christianity (esp. in the period of the <ref type="cr">Crusades</ref>) had its impact on themes and forms of expressions. There is some evidence in the early Syr. tradition of the use of portable icons (the image of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, which was believed to be a portrait of Jesus, being the most famous of these), but it is only among the Christians of the Chalcedonian traditions (Melkite and Maronite) that the art of icon painting flourished and that local styles emerged, such as in the 13th cent. in Tripoli and in the 17th cent. in <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>. In the other Syr. traditions (Syr. Orth. and Ch. of E.) the cult of images in whatever form never became as prominent as it was in the Byzantine tradition, even though there is no evidence of any opposition to the use of figurative art, and suggestions that Syr. Christianity was somehow connected to the iconoclastic movement within the Byzantine tradition or to any other an-iconic tradition should be rejected (Brock 2004; Teule). In general, the study of Syr. Christian art and architecture is seriously hampered by the fact that the surviving remains are fragmentary and mostly deprived of their original context. Accompanying <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref>, occasionally containing dates and names, may provide crucial information. In the present overview only a few areas will be highlighted.</p>
<label type="subsection">1. Pre-Christian Edessa</label>
<p>The art of the semi-independent kingdom of Edessa is accessible to us in a number of funerary mosaics, dated or datable to the first three cent. AD (prior to the mid–3rd cent.). Some of these show portraits of the deceased, often with their family; others have topics or figures from Greco-Roman antiquity, such as the Phoenix or Orpheus playing the lyre. Reflecting the life of the urban aristocracy, the mosaics show the proximity of the Parthian world, in particular in the costumes (Leroy 1957). Most of the mosaics (some of which are dated in their inscriptions) are contemporaneous with the nascent Christian communities in Edessa, and with our earliest Christian authors, such as <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>, but none of them can be identified as specifically Christian (Drijvers and Healey; Healey; Segal).</p>
<label type="subsection">2. Christian Architecture in Syria, Ṭur ʿAbdin, 
and Mesopotamia</label>
<p>The earliest dated church in the Syr. Christian area is the church of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref>which in a baptistery inscription that survives to the present day is dated to 359, i.e. the time when <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>lived in the city. Even though we are in the easternmost corner of the Roman Empire and in the heartland of Syr. Christianity, the inscription is not in Syriac, but in Greek.</p>
<p>Most of the evidence for churches between the 4th and 7th cent. is from the region between <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>and Aleppo. Known as the ‘Dead cities’, because they were abandoned in the early Islamic period due to shifting patterns of economy and trade (and are still largely deserted today), numerous sites show the secular and religious buildings of villages and medium-size communities. Several churches are impressive, and the architectural skeleton of some of them is well-preserved, having been exposed to the forces of nature only, not to re-use or destruction by humans. Some churches are very small (such as the single-aisled church of Qirqbize). Other churches derive their importance from their role as pilgrim destinations, such as the church of Qalbloze, and above all the magnificent church of <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>, which was built in the late 5th cent. and which consists of four three-aisled basilicas converging on the saint’s pillar. Even today the scattered ruins and the very refined capital sculptures evoke the church’s former majesty. Another popular pilgrim destination, which flourished in the 6th cent., is the shrine of Mar Sargis (St. Sergius) in Resafa, more eastwards in the Syrian steppe (ca. 160  km. southeast of Aleppo).</p>
<p>The region of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> and the wider area around it also preserve some of the earliest churches of Syr. Christianity, some of which were expanded throughout the centuries and are still in use today. The well-preserved main church of <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> dates back to the 
6th cent., while some of the rebuilding and refurbishment of the church of the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref> can be dated to the reign of the Byzantine emperor Anastasius (r. 491–518). Several other churches in this area go back to the early Islamic period, such as the church of Ḥaḥ and the church of the Holy Cross, in the monastery of the same name (<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Ṣalīb</ref>).</p>
<p>A special architectural feature in some of the earliest churches is the bema. This is a raised platform, usually horseshoe-shaped and with low walls, which is located in the middle of the nave and on which the liturgy of the Word was performed. The above-mentioned churches of Qirqbize, Qalbloze, and Resafa provide interesting examples, while detached pieces of the bema construction have found their way to modern museums, such as the stone bema lectern of Bennawi, which is presently shown in the garden of the National Museum of 
<ref type="cr">Damascus</ref> (Brock and Taylor, <i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol. 2, 43). In recent years the bema has received considerable attention, both from liturgists and archeologists (Cassis, Loosley, Renhart, and Taft).</p>
<p>Several other detached pieces of church decoration, chancel panels, or door lintels, exhibiting ornamental motifs or iconographical themes, are found scattered all over the world. Two chancel panels in stone, uncovered at Rasm al-Qanafez (to the east of Salamiyya, Syria) and presently in the National Museum of Damascus, show Daniel among the lions and the three Magi approaching the Virgin with Child 
(<i>Syrie</i>, 358–59; Peña, 84).</p>
<p>Floor mosaics as well often have left their original location. Most of the mosaics belonging to churches in Syria and Lebanon have conveniently been brought together by P. Donceel-Voûte, with the ‘Adam mosaic’ in the Michaelion of Huarte (ca. 15 km. north-northeast of <ref type="cr">Apamea</ref>) as one of the highlights (Donceel-Voûte, 105), to be compared with the royal Adam shown on a mosaic panel in the Museum of Ḥama, the latter with 
a Greek and Syriac caption (ibid., 113; also in Brock and Taylor, <i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol. 2, 41). More recently beautiful mosaics have been uncovered at Tall Biʿa, near Raqqaʿ/Kallinikos, in the church of a monastery that may have been the Monastery of Mar Zakkay, to which <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Tella</ref> once belonged (Kalla, with further references).</p>
<p>While by far the largest part of our evidence for the early period belongs to the W.-Syr. tradition (in particular Syr. Orth. and Melkite), there has been in recent years considerable and promising archeological activity in the geographical area of the Ch. of E. (Hauser; Kröger, with further references). The Christian monuments of Iraq (belonging to either the Ch. of E. or the Syr. Orth. tradition), a number of which go back to the first millennium, have been surveyed by Fiey in his three-volume publication <i>Assyrie chrétienne</i>, while the same scholar devoted a separate volume to <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> (1959). Sites of particular significance are the city of <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref> (Harrak 2001), <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> and <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Behnam</ref> (nowadays Syr. Cath.), with its exceptional 13th-cent. carvings on the main entrance door. There is also some evidence of building activity associated with the Ch. of E. in the Holy Land, in particular a hermitage near Jericho (Fiey 1983, and Brock and Taylor, <i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol. 2, 46) and possibly a monastic complex at Tel Masos, in the northern Negev (Fritz and Maiberger).</p>
<label type="subsection">3. Manuscript Illumination</label>
<p>An excellent survey of illuminated mss. kept in Western and Middle-Eastern libraries, with detailed analysis, is available in Leroy 1964. The most significant set of early illuminations is found in the opening quire of the 6th-cent. ms. that contains the <ref type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref> (named after the scribe of the Gospel text), with its richly decorated canon tables and its full-page illuminations. Of the same period, or possibly slightly later, is the so-called ‘Syriac Bible from Paris’ (Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 341), which contains mostly OT themes and figures (Sörries). The art of ms. illumination came to full fruition in the 11th to 13th cent.: along with biblical mss., such as the ‘Buchanan Bible’ (ms. Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Oo.I.1,2; on which, see Hunt), there are a number of lectionaries, most of them belonging to the Syr. Orth. tradition. The number of E.-Syr. illuminated mss. is very limited (for some 15th-cent. examples, see Leroy, 417–18 and 393–403; Brock and Taylor, <i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol. 2, 237–38). In the 16th cent. the tradition of ms. illumination was given new life among the Chaldeans (see e.g. ms. Borgia Syr. 169, Leroy, 404–8). For more recent studies, esp. on the Syr. Orth. mss. of the 11th–13th cent., see e.g. Doumato. It should also be noted that ms. illumination is not limited to the mss. of the mainstream ecclesiastical traditions, but is also found, e.g., in magic mss. (Balicka-Witakowska 2008).</p>
<label type="subsection">4. Wall Paintings</label>
<p>Most of the late antique churches must have contained painting, either of a purely ornamental nature or intended to provide instruction or to impart devotion. Remains of painting can be found on some of the ruins, but no full Christian wall paintings from the first millennium have survived. The <ref type="cr">wall paintings in Syria and Lebanon</ref> deserve separate attention, with those of <ref type="cr">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>, <ref type="cr">Qara</ref>, and the Lebanese Qadisha Valley as unmistakable highlights. Most of these belong to the period between the 11th and 13th century. To the same period in all likelihood belongs a newly discovered wall painting in the church of Mar Gewargis in <ref type="cr">Qaraqosh</ref>, near Mosul, representing the Baptism of Jesus (Snelders 2007). The art of wall painting continued well into the modern area. Interesting 18th-cent. examples are found in the Syr. Orth. church of Sergius and Bacchus in Ṣadad, ca. 100 km. north east of Damascus (Brock and Taylor, <i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol. 2, 147–50).</p>
<p>In addition to the heartlands of Syr. Christianity, wall paintings reflecting Syriac Christianity may be found in <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in Egypt, which from the early 9th cent. onwards had a mixed Coptic and Syriac monastic population. While the earliest paintings in the main Church of the monastery predate the arrival of Syr. monks, some of the later paintings must reflect the interests and taste of the Syr. monks. This may be the case for the probably 10th-cent. painting of the Three Patriarchs (Innemée 1998), and even more so for the very fragmentarily 
preserved paintings of Emperor Constantine and King 
Abgar (holding the <i>mandylion</i>), both of which are accompanied by Syriac inscriptions and may also belong to the 10th  cent. (Innemée and Van Rompay). Fully preserved paintings in three half-domes of the church, with Syriac inscriptions, belong to the early 13th cent. (Leroy 1982).</p>
<label type="subsection">5. Liturgical Vessels and Accessories</label>
<p>A large number of 5th- or 6th-cent. liturgical objects from Syria have been uncovered in the course of the 20th cent., in the area south-west of Aleppo (Mundell Mango). In some cases inscriptions provide information on the date and on the church to which the objects belonged: Kaper Koraon (the exact location of which is uncertain) and Beth Misona (three chalices and a paten, now in the Cleveland Museum of Art). While the link with Syriac Christianity seems to be obvious, the inscriptions are in Greek, not in Syriac. A  rare Syriac inscribed silver dish from the 6th cent., in the collection of the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, has been made popular among Syr. scholars by R. Murray’s <i>Symbols of Church and Kingdom</i> (1975 and 2004). It represents the Ascension, the women at the tomb, and the Crucifixion, along with soldiers, Peter and the cock, and Daniel in the lions’ den.</p>
<p>To a slightly later period, perhaps 8th or 9th cent., belongs a very well preserved bronze incense burner uncovered in Takrit (now in the National Museum of Baghdad); it has nine scenes from the life of Jesus (Harrak 2006), but no inscriptions.</p>
<p>From the early 13th-cent. a bronze liturgical fan is preserved (<i>marwḥā</i> or <i>marwaḥtā</i>, ‘flabellum’), now housed in the Belgian Museum of Mariemont. The Syr. inscription reports that it was made in 1202/3 for Dayr al-Suryān in Egypt; it may have been produced in a workshop in the Mosul area (Snelders and Immerzeel). To the same period belongs the church treasure of Resafa, which includes a skillfully decorated silver chalice and a paten, both bearing inscriptions in Syriac (even though the objects may have been of Western origin or inspiration). The paten was a gift to the church of St. Sergius at Resafa by Ḥasnon of Edessa. These objects had probably been buried in order to be saved from the Mongol invasions of 1259/60 (Ulbert; Brock and Taylor, <i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol. 2, 212).</p>
<label type="subsection">6. Liturgical Vestments</label>
<p>While some information on liturgical vestments may be extracted from literary sources and from depictions in ms. illuminations and wall paintings, a rare piece, presently housed in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, has recently been studied: a bishop’s stole (<i>batrashil), bearing inscriptions in Syriac and Arabic. It was made for Bp.</i>Athanasius Abraham Yaghmur of Nabk in 1534–35 (Ball).</p>
<label type="subsection">7. Syr. Christian Art in the 21st Century</label>
<p>While the precious remains of ancient Syr. Christian art and architecture nowadays are receiving more attention from Syr. scholars and Syr. Christians alike, Syr. Christians at the same time are creating their own art forms, often inspired by the treasures of the past, to which they add new layers of interpretation and meaning according to their present-day situation. Churches are being renovated or new churches are being built in the Middle East, in India, and in the worldwide <ref type="cr">Diaspora</ref>. In many of these churches the ancient art of wall painting is brought to new life, while present-day liturgical publications often reflect the illuminated manuscripts of the past (for the Maronite tradition, see e.g. Badwi).</p>
<p>See Fig. 1, 9–15, 62, 63, 64, 65, 71c, 77c, 80, 86, 88c, 101, 104c, 112, 115, and 116–118.</p>

<p>Maronite polymath, Custodian of the Vatican Library, and titular bp. of Tyre. Born at Hasrun, he was educated from an early age at the Maronite College in Rome. From 1715–7 he travelled in the Middle East, collecting mss., including many from <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in the Nitrian Desert. In 1739 he was appointed First Custodian of the Vatican Library, a post he held until his death. It was on the basis of the Syriac mss., in large part from Dayr al-Suryān, that he compiled his monumental <i>Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino-Vaticana</i>, in four volumes (1719–28; repr. 1975, with ‘Postface’ by J.-M. Sauget; and 2002). This was effectively the first European history of Syriac literature, and it remains an important resource even today, thanks to the many extensive excerpts of Syriac texts. The volumes are arranged as follows: I, Orthodox (i.e. Chalcedonian) authors; II, Syrian Orthodox writers; III.1, literature of the Church of the East, and III.2, history of the Church of the East. (III.1, 3–362 contains an annotated edition of the verse catalogue of Syriac authors by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>). The three-volume Catalogue of the Hebrew and Syriac mss. in the Vatican Library was also compiled by him in conjunction with Stephanus Evodius (1756–9; the Syriac mss. are described in 
vols. 2–3). He was also the editor of the three volumes of Greek texts attributed to <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> (1732, 1743, 1746; the three Syriac volumes were edited by <ref type="cr">P.

Mai, in <i>Scriptorum Veterum Nova Collectio III.2</i> (1828), 165–68; this includes the many works left unpublished, or unfinished at his death (he had planned several further volumes of the <i>Bibliotheca Orientalis</i>); some of these were published posthumously (e.g. his monograph on the Patriarchs of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, 1881), while others perished in a fire several months after his death. Ms. Vat. Syr. 389 is an autograph Syriac grammar (1707). He also played a central role in the Synod of Mount Lebanon (1736).</p>

<p>Scholar of the Christian East, professor at the University of Munich. Assfalg was born in Hohenaschau, Bavaria, on 6 Nov. 1919 and studied philosophy, theo­logy, and Near-Eastern languages (Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac) in Freising and Eichstätt. He served in the German army during World War II and became a prisoner of war in France. In 1946, he continued his studies at the University of Munich, where he specialized in the field of Eastern Christian studies, in particular under the guidance of W. Hengstenberg (philology of the Christian East) and A. Spitaler (Semitic languages). He earned his doctoral degree in 1950 with a dissertation on ‘The Order of the Priesthood’, an Arabic liturgical manual of the Coptic Church, and his ‘Habilitation’ in 1961 with an edition of the Old Georgian text of the Minor Prophets. Well-versed in all the languages of the Christian East, he taught at the University of Munich from 1963 and continued to do so, even after his official retirement in 1985. He died on 12 Jan. 2001 in Munich.</p>
<p>Among his Syriac publications, the catalogue of Syriac mss. in Germany (1963) should be singled out. Together with P. Krüger he co-edited the <i>Kleines Wörterbuch des Christlichen Orients</i> (1975), which was subsequently translated (with minor updates) into French (1991) and Polish (1998). His name is also closely associated with the journal <i>Oriens Christianus</i>, of which he was co-editor from 1965 until his death. For his 70th birthday, a <i>Festschrift</i> was presented to him (1979), which includes several contributions in the field of Syriac.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>In pre-modern sources, Assyrians (<i>Atorāye</i>) were inhabitants of the area or ecclesiastical province of Ator, around <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>. In modern times, however, the name has taken on two expanded senses: to denote 1. the whole ethnic group historically represented by the Ch. of E.; and sometimes 2. the supposed ethnic group represented by all the Syriac churches.</p>
<p>1. In medieval sources there are isolated references that connect Syr. Christians with the ancient Assyrians, but this identification was not developed until the 19th  cent. A. H. Layard identified the Christians he met as descendants of the ancient Assyrians whose buildings he was excavating (<i>Nineveh and its Remains</i>, vol. 2 [1848], 237). Since the area around Mosul had been called ‘Assyria’ from ancient times, this identification was not unnatural. It was a further development, however, when Anglicans (probably first G. P. Badger), seeking to avoid the word ‘Nestorian’, began to use the name ‘Assyrian Christians’ for the whole Church of the East. This usage was made official by the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission to the Assyrian Christians (1886) — although the missionaries did not use the word once they were in the field. The general adoption of ‘Assyrian’ and the Assyrian ethnology by the people themselves came after 1900 under the influence of nationalist writers like Freydon Atoraya. It was further encouraged when the founding of the present state of Syria made it more urgent to find an ethnic name other than ‘Syrian’. A  popular etymology had it that <i>Surāyā</i> (a variant of <i>Suryāyā</i>, ‘Syrian’) was a corruption of <i>Asurāyā</i> (even though correctly ‘Assyrian’ is <i>Atorāyā</i>). Whatever its background, the name ‘Assyrian’ has proved convenient and is now generally used even by those who do not accept the connection with ancient Assyria. The Church of the East, although it has not especially promoted this connection, is officially styled ‘Church of the East of the Assyrians’ or ‘Assyrian Church of the East’. Among Chaldean Catholics, ‘Assyrian’ has had to compete with ‘Chaldean’ as the preferred ethnic name. Some have adopted ‘Assyro-Chaldean’ as a compromise.</p>
<p>2. The name ‘Assyrian’ was already in use in some W.-Syr. circles before World War I. It was popularized in the USA by writers like <ref type="cr">Naʿʿūm Fāʾiq</ref>, and <ref type="cr">D. B. Perley</ref> who insisted that the different Syriac churches, eastern and western, were accidental divisions within a single nation. (From this period dates the adoption of ‘Assyrian’ into the names of some American Syr. Orth. parishes, who retain it today although without the accompanying nationalist agenda.) The Syr. Orth. hierarchy has generally opposed the name ‘Assyrian’, and writers within the Church emphasize its Aramean heritage over against any alleged Assyrian one.</p>

<p>Long-serving Patr. of the Syr. Orth. Church in the late 6th and early 7th cent. His consecration is commonly dated to 594 or 595, but there is confusion in the ­sources as to the exact date: medieval and modern authors have also suggested 587, 597, and 603 as possibilities. All sources agree that Athanasios died in 631 and one gives 28 July as the precise day (<i>Chronica Minora</i>, vol. 2, ed. 
E. W. Brooks, p. 144).</p>
<p>Athanasios was ordained Patr. against his will. Afterwards, his bishops agreed to allow him to return to his monastery for a year to complete the task which had been assigned him there: tending camels. When the 
bishops came to collect Athanasios a year later, they found him working in a mud pit, helping to patch up a camel stable. This association with camels earned him the epithet <i>Gamolo</i> ‘Camel Driver.’</p>
<p>Athanasios’s patriarchate spanned a tumultuous period in the history of the Near East: the Byzantine-Persian wars of the early 7th cent. Most of Athanasios’s actions recorded in historical sources relate to his confronting the implications for the church of changing political 
orders; in the course of his service he dealt either directly or indirectly with both Byzantine and Persian rulers.</p>
<p>Athanasios is credited with reorganizing the structure of the Syr. Orth. Church in the Persian Empire. He appointed bishops there and gave <ref type="cr">Dayro 
d-Mor Matay</ref> primacy over all other monasteries in the Persian Empire.</p>
<p>In perhaps 629–30, Athanasios, along with twelve bishops, met with the Emperor Heraclius for twelve days in Mabbug and held theological discussions. When they ultimately refused to accept the Council of Chalcedon, Heraclius became enraged and unleashed a persecution on Miaphysites throughout the Empire.</p>
<p>In either 610 or 616, Athanasios and Anastasius, the Miaphysite Patr. of Alexandria, ended the Tritheist Schism which had divided the two churches since the late 6th-cent. dispute between Damian and <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref>.</p>
<p>The ‘Conflict of Severus’ (PO 4 and PO 49.4), which exists in Coptic fragments as well as in Arabic and Ethiopic, is the only stand-alone work of Athanasios which survives. His other extant works are all to be found embedded in the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>. They include: a letter of Athanasios to Quryaqos of <ref type="cr">Amid</ref> (vol. 2, 381–94; vol. 4, 392–9); the synodicon established by Athanasios and Anastasios, Patr. of Alex­andria, ending the Tritheist schism (vol.  2, 381–93; vol. 4, 392–9); an encyclical of Athanasios to the bps. of the East (vol.  2, 394–9; vol. 4, 400–2); a <i>libellus</i> of Athanasios to Heraclius (vol. 2, 405–8; vol. 4, 404–8); and a letter to the Monks of Mor Matay (vol. 2, 414–7; vol.  4, 411–3).</p>

A single work by Athanasios from this time survives, a letter written against Christians who attend pagan feasts and eat the meat of pagan sacrifices. A later scribe added an incipit claiming that the letter refers to the sacrifices of Hagarenes. Athanasios died in September of 687 and was succeeded by Yulyanos 
Rumoyo.</p>
<p>Throughout his life Athanasios was an avid translator of Greek philosophical works and patristic authors. Several of his translations still survive. These include a translation of <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s Isagoge that Athanasios completed in 645 (ms. Vat. Syr. 158), the translation of an anonymous Greek introduction to logic (ms.

<p>Bp. of Alexandria and Greek author. He became bp. of Alexandria in 328, but spent much of his life in exile due to his vigorous opposition to Arianism. Many of his numerous writings (in Greek) were translated into Syriac, and some of these survive in several recensions. Most of Athanasius’s works in Syriac are only known from early Syr. Orth. or Melkite mss. (in some cases there have been some dogmatic alterations). <ref type="cr">Timo­theos  I</ref>, however, in his Letters knew of several works, and the Letter to Epictetus is quoted in both E.- and W.-Syr. dogmatic florilegia.

<p>Bp., lexicographer, and translator into Syriac. He was born in <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref> of Qasha Hirmiz bar Michael who was the brother of Patr. Yawsep Audo. Audo’s brother Israel Audo became the bp. of <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>. After completing his elementary studies in Alqosh, his uncle the patr. took him to Rome where Audo joined the college of Congregatio de Propaganda Fide from 1869 to 1880. He was ordained a priest in 1880 and returned to <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> where he served under his uncle’s successor Patr. Eliya ʿAbū al-Yūnan. He later served as patriarchal vicar to <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> in 1882 for four years, after which he returned to Mosul to take charge of the <ref type="cr">Seminary of St. John</ref>. He was consecrated bp. of <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref> and Salamas in 1892, and participated in the Synod that elected Patr. ʿAbdishoʿ Khayyāṭ in 1894. During the persecutions that occurred during World War I, he protected and provided shelter to many refugees, only to become a victim himself when he was assassinated, along with other priests and parishioners, on 27 July 1918.</p>
<p>Audo produced a Syriac-Syriac lexicon entitled <i>Simta d-leššāna suryāyā</i> / <i>Dictionnaire de la langue chaldéenne</i>(2  vols.; Mosul, 1897–1901); a grammar of Swadaya (i.e. colloquial) Neo-Aramaic entitled <i>Gramaṭiqi d-leššānā swādāyā</i>  / <i>Grammaire de la langue chaldéenne moderne. Dialecte d-Ourmiah</i> (Urmia, 1905; 
2nd  ed. 1911); and a liturgy for the feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, published by <ref type="cr">Bedjan</ref> in <i>Breviarium Chaldaicum</i>, vol. 3 (Paris, 1886–7). He translated the following works from Latin into Syriac: P. Scavini’s <i>Theologia moralis ad mentem S. Alphonsi M. de Ligorio (2 vols.; Urmia, 1899, 1900)</i>; <i>Catechismus Romanus ex decreto Concilii Tridentini</i> (The Catechism of the Council of Trent) (Mosul, 1889); Nieremberg’s <i>La Balance du Temps</i> (Mosul, date unknown); and Louis Togni’s <i>Instructio pro sacris Ecclesiae</i><i>ministris</i> (French title <i>Instruction pour les ministres de L’Église</i>; Mosul, 1895). He also translated from Arabic into Syriac the fables of <ref type="cr">Kalila and Dimna</ref> (French title <i>Kalila et Dimna</i><i>fables indiennes</i>; Mosul, 1895). He also revised a translation into Syriac, made by the Chald. monk <ref type="cr">Damyanos of Alqosh</ref> (d. 1858), of an Arabic version of Paolo Segneri’s <i>Manuale Sacerdotum</i> (Mosul, 1882; 2nd ed. 1893).</p>

<Author>G. A. Kiraz</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Awgen, Mar</head><ab type="infobox"/>(fl. 4th – early 5th cent.) 
<p>Mar Awgen is the traditional founder of monasticism in Mesopotamia. The two primary sources for his life are an anonymous ‘Life of Mar Awgen’ and a brief account preserved in the ‘Book of Chastity’, composed by <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>of Baṣra (9th cent.). He receives an earlier mention in <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref>, in the 7th cent. Mar Awgen was an Egyptian, born in the time of Constantine. He worked for twenty-five years as a pearl diver, but then left this occupation to join the nascent monastic movement, and he became a disciple of Pachomius, the famous Egyptian monastic leader. After spending some time in the monastery of Pachomius, Mar Awgen travelled to <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> and founded a monastery on nearby Mt. Izla. His seventy disciples who followed him from Egypt were the reputed founders of other monasteries in various parts of Mesopotamia and other Syriac-speaking lands. Mar Awgen himself is said to have performed numerous miracles in the presence of Shapur, the King of Persia. It has also been reported that his remains and those of certain of his disciples were brought to the Monastery of Mar Ḥananya (<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>). Mar Awgen is held in the highest esteem in all the eastern churches with Syriac roots.</p>
<p>Scholars have now shown that this traditional account does not have a firm historical foundation and has served primarily to obfuscate the native origins of Syro-Mesopotamian monasticism in favor of reputed Egypt­ian origins. These accounts of Mar Awgen have been shown to be of late origin, anachronistic, and extremely divergent on important details, e.g. the number of his disciples ranges from eighteen to seventy, and a number of monks named in these accounts actually lived as late as the 7th and even 10th cent. Attempts to connect Mar Awgen to the Aōnes mentioned in Sozomen’s Ecclesiastical History (VI.33) have failed, and it is even possible, as some scholars have surmised, that there was, in fact, no such historical person as Mar Awgen.</p>

<p>Theologian and monastic author. The main sources for Babai’s life are <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>’s ‘Book of Chastity’ (chap.  39), <ref type="cr">Toma of Marga</ref>’s ‘Book of Superiors’ (I, ch. 27 and 29), and the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>(chap. 84). Born in Beth ʿAynatha (in Beth Zabdai), he studied at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> under <ref type="cr">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref>. He subsequently became a monk of the ‘Great Monastery’, founded in 571 by <ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref> (d. 588). Later, he moved to Beth Zabdai to found his own monastery there, but in 604 he returned to the Great Monastery, where he had been appointed Abbot, in succession to Dadishoʿ. During the interregnum (609–28) following the death of the Cath. <ref type="cr">Grigor</ref>, the Ch. of E. was administered jointly by the Archdeacon and Babai, the latter having the title ‘Visitor of the monasteries’. He died shortly after the death of Khusrau II (628), who had not allowed the appointment of a successor to Grigor.</p>
<p>Babai’s writings cover four main topics:</p>
<p>1. Christology. His ‘Book of the Union, on the divinity and humanity (of Christ) and on the prosopon of the union’, remains a fundamental statement of the Christology of the Church to this day. It is composed in seven books, of which the seventh may originally have belonged to another work. The ‘Book of the Union’ was edited (with LT) by A. Vaschalde (CSCO 79–80; 1915); there is an unpublished ET by M. Birnie. In the same volume of the CSCO there is also a short treatise ‘Against those who say “Just as the body and soul are one <i>qnomā</i>, so too God the Word and the Man are one <i>qnomā</i>” ’. An excerpt arguing that ‘two natures’ (in the incarnate Christ) implies ‘two <i>qnome</i>’ features in a late collection of Christological texts (ed. with ET by L. Abramowski and A. Goodman, <i>Nestorian Christological Texts</i> [1972], vol. 1, 207–9 [Syr.], vol. 2, 123–5 [ET]).</p>
<p>2. Monastic topics. Of great significance, for its learning as well as for its length, is his Commentary on <ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>’s ‘Gnostic Chapters’ (ed. with GT by Frankenberg, 1912). Babai also wrote a Commentary on <ref type="cr">Mark the Monk</ref>’s ‘Spiritual Law’ (unpublished; study by G. Krüger, in <i>OC</i> 44 [1960], 46–74). A collection of short ‘Useful Counsels on the Ascetic Life’ are also unpublished, but there is an ET by G. Chediath, <i>Babai the Great. Some Useful Counsels on the Ascetic Life</i> (Moran Etho 15; 2001). Babai wrote a set of Rules for monks, preserved only in Arabic translation (ed. with ET, <ref type="cr">A. Vööbus</ref>, <i>Syriac and</i> <i>Arabic Documents regarding Legislation relative to Syrian Asceticism</i> [1960], 176–84).</p>
<p>3. Hagiography. In his Life of Gewargis (ed. <ref type="cr">P. Bedjan</ref>, <i>Histoire de Mar Jabalaha, de trois autres patriarches, d’un prêtre et deux laiques, nestoriens</i> [1895; repr. 2007], 424–8) Babai gives a list of his hagiographical works, but of these only the Life of Mihramgushnasp/Gewargis (martyred in 615) survives in full (ed. Bedjan, <i>Histoire de Mar Jabalaha,</i>416–571; GT by G. Hoffmann, 1880). Unfortunately the only ms. of a woman martyr, Christina, breaks off soon after the beginning (ed. Bedjan, <i>Acta Martyrum et Sanctorum</i>, vol. 4, 201–7).</p>
<p>4. Liturgy. Two <i>tešbḥātā</i> (‘Our Father who is in heaven, holy is his nature...’ and ‘Blessed is the Compassionate One who in his grace...’) are specifically attributed to him (though some mss. have a different attribution); the first of these also features in the Maronite <i>Šḥimto</i> (Thurs. <i>Lilyo</i>). A Hymn for the Commemoration of the Greek Doctors is also attributed to him (ms. Cambridge Add. 1980, f. 210r; not found in T. Darmo’s edition of the <i>ḥudrā</i>).</p>
<p>5. Parts of a work on the monastic life are preserved in a ms. (M20N) of the ‘New Finds’ at the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref>, Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>A large number of other works by Babai have not survived (<ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> states that he wrote ‘83 volumes’ in all).</p>

<p>City on the Tigris, approximately 35 km. north of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>. The seat of the Ch. of E. Cath. under the Abbasids and the seat today of the Chald. Patr. and Ancient Ch. of E. Patr. ‘Baghdad’, whose etymology is disputed, was originally the name of one of the villages that stood on the site of the city founded by the second Abbasid caliph al-Manṣūr under the name of Madīnat al-Salām ‘City of Peace’ in 762. Later Syriac authors often call the city ‘Babel’, i.e. Babylon. From 762 until 1258, when it was taken by Hulagu (except in 836–92, when the caliphs resided in Sāmarrāʾ), Baghdad was the seat of the Abbasid caliphate, and in the first half of that period was among the most prosperous and culturally advanced cities in the world. Capital of a province corresponding largely to the central part of today’s Iraq under the Ottomans (1534–1623, 1638–1918), Baghdad became the capital of the newly formed state of Iraq in 1921.</p>
<p>The first Ch. of E. Cath. to spend time in Baghdad was Yaʿqob II (753–73), namely in a prison there, an experience shared by the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref type="cr">Giwargis</ref> I (759–90) and the Melk. Patr. Theodoros (751–97). Cath. <ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ <ref type="cr">II</ref> (773–80), though elected in the Monastery of Mar Petion in Baghdad, continued to reside in Seleucia-Ctesiphon. With <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> (780–823) the 
Catholicoi begin to reside permanently in Baghdad. Major groups of Christians who settled in the city came from earlier E. Syr. centers at <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref>, Kashkar (al-Wāsiṭ), and <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>. W.-Syr. Christians also had a significant presence in Baghdad by the end of the 8th cent. Beginning with Timotheos I himself, in the period down to the middle of the 11th cent., Syr. Christian scholars played a vital role in the intellectual life of Baghdad, especially as physicians and as translators of Greek philosophical and scientific works into Arabic — scholars such as <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873), Abū Bishr Mattā b. Yūnus (d. 940), <ref type="cr">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (893–974), and <ref type="cr">Abū al-Faraj ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> 
(d. 1043), to name but a few (see <ref type="cr">medicine</ref> and <ref type="cr">Greek, 
Syriac translations from</ref>). Though not subject to official persecutions as occurred earlier under the Sasanians, the Christians in Baghdad were subject to certain discriminations and were vulnerable to attacks by the populace, especially at times of instability under weak governments, which was often the case from the middle of the 10th cent. onwards.</p>
<p>The residences of the Catholicoi generally followed the movement of the political and commercial center of the city. In the first period, they resided on the right bank of the Tigris, in the Monastery of Klil Ishoʿ (also called Dayr al-Jāthalīq ‘Monastery of the Catholicos’) to the south of the ‘Round City’, where most of the Catholicoi from Timotheos I to Sargis I (860–72) were buried, and in the Monastery of Mar Petion (Dayr al-ʿAtīqa) in the former village of Sūrāyā (al-ʿAtīqa) to the east of the Round City, which predated the foundation of Madīnat al-Salām and was restored by Sabrishoʿ II (831–35). Yoḥannan II (884–91) was the first Catholicos to establish his residence on the left bank, in the Shammāsiyya Quarter in the northern part of the walled city of that period. Most of the Catholicoi from Yoḥannan III (893–
899) to Eliya II (1111–32) resided there and were buried in the ‘Palace of the Greeks’ (Dār al-Rūm). Barṣawma  I (1134–36) moved his residence south to the Church of Mar Sabrishoʿ in Sūq al-Thalātha, and Yahbalaha II (1190–1222) to the Church of St. Mary in the Karkh Quarter on the west bank. After the fall of Baghdad to the initially pro-Christian Mongols, Makkika  II (1257–65) was given a group of buildings centered around the mansion of a former vizier on the Tigris as his residence, but his successor Denḥa I (1265–81) was forced to withdraw to <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref> by Muslim reactions against Mongol rule in the city. <ref type="cr">Yahbalaha III</ref> (1281–1317), <ref type="cr">Timotheos II</ref> (1318–32) and, probably, Denḥa II (mid-14th cent.) were still consecrated in Baghdad, but normally resided away from Baghdad in northern Iraq and (today’s Iranian) Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Ḥabib, the first known Syr. Orth. bp. of Baghdad, is attested in 818. Among the churches belonging to the Syr. Orth. community in Baghdad was that of Mār Tūmā, the burial place of Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī, in the Christian quarter (Qaṭīʿat al-Naṣārā) to the south of the Round City. Ch. of E. Cath. Yoḥannan V (1000–11) succeeded in obtaining a decree from the caliph forbidding the long-term residence of Syr. Orth. maphrians in Baghdad during a visit to the city by Maph. Ignatius bar Qiqi (991–1016) in 1003/4. Nevertheless, <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon bar Maʿdani</ref> (Maphr. 1232–53, Patr. 1253–63) was later able to spend several years of his maphrianate in Baghdad, devoting part of that time to the study of Arabic literature. The last pre-modern Syr. Orth. bp. of Baghdad was Timotheos 
Yeshuʿ, ordained there by <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> in 1265.</p>
<p>Little is heard of the Christians in Baghdad after the sack of the city by Timur in 1401, and it is only in the 17th cent. that we have evidence again of the presence of Christians in any significant numbers. From the middle of the 19th cent., the Chald. patriarchs (bearing the title ‘of Babylon’), though normally resident in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, often visited Baghdad. Two of them, Yoḥannan  VIII Hormizd (1830–38) and ʿAbdishoʿ V Khayyāṭ (1895–99), died and were buried in Baghdad. The Chald. patriarchate was transferred from Mosul to Baghdad de facto under Yawsep VII Ghanīma (1947–58) and officially under Pawlos   II Cheikho (1958–89). The Ch. of E. Patr. Shemʿon XX Pawlos (1918–20), who died as a refugee in Baʿqūba, was interred in Baghdad. The Ch. of E. has had a bishop in Baghdad since 1951. Baghdad has been the seat of the patriarchs of the Ancient Church of the East since 1968, when <ref type="cr">Toma Darmo</ref> (d.  1969) was elected patriarch there by those opposed to the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in the Ch. of E. The Syr. Catholic Church has had a bp. resident in Baghdad since 1862. The new Syr. Orth. see of Baghdad and Baṣra was erected in 1960, and has had the scholar Būlus Behnām (metr. 1962–69) and the future patriarch Severus (later Ignatius) Zakkā ʿIwāṣ (metr. 1969–80, Patr. 1980–) as its occupants.</p>
<p>There are around fifty churches of various denominations in the city today (including 24 Chald., 7 Syr. Orth., 4 Ch. of E., 3 Syr. Catholic, and 2 Ancient Ch. of E. in regular use, according to S. Rassam, <i>Christianity in Iraq</ref>, 2005). The oldest is that of Virgin Mary on al-Maydān Square near the northern end of the Ottoman city area, built in 1639 and now in Armenian Orthodox hands. 
A number of churches were founded in the 19th  cent. in the area that came to be called ʿAqd al-Naṣārā nearer the center of the old city, including the Chald. Church of Mary Mother of Sorrows (Umm al-Aḥzān; place of burial of Patr. Yoḥannan VIII, ʿAbdishoʿ V, and Pawlos II) and the former Syr. Cath. cathedral, as well as the Latin church now used by the Coptic Orthodox. Many of the newer representative churches are found in the area to the southeast of the city center, including the new Syr. Cath. Cathedral of Our Lady of Deliverance/Sayyidat al-Najāt (1968, commonly called Umm al-Ṭāq) and the Chald. Church of St. Joseph (Kharbanda, 1956; place of burial of Patr. Yawsep VII) in the eastern part of al-Karrāda. The Syr. Orth. cathedral (Sts. Peter and Paul, 1964) is located further east near the University of Technology, and the Ancient Church of the East cathedral (Virgin Mary, 1988) further southeast in Ḥayy al-Riyāḍ. Another important Christian area of the city is al-Dawra to the south of the large bend of the Tigris, including the ‘Assyrian Quarter’ (Ḥayy al-Āthūriyyīn) in its southern part and Ḥayy al-Mīkānīk further south with the Ch.  of E. Church of Mar Zaya (built to replace the former Cathedral of Mar Zaya in Karrādat Maryam which was demolished by the government in 1985) and the Pontifical Babel College for Philosophy and Theology (founded in 1991, temporarily transferred to ʿAynkawa near Arbela in 2007). Many of the churches in Baghdad have been the targets of terrorist attacks in the period of instability since 2003.</p>
<p>The Syriac Corporation of the Iraqi Academy of Science, originally founded as the Syriac Academy in 1975, has played an important role in the promotion of the academic study of Syriac. A Department of Syriac Language was established at the University of Baghdad in 2004. The troubles since 2003 have had adverse effects on the state of Syriac and Christian Arabic mss. in Baghdad, including those in major collections, such as those of the Chald. Monastery of St. Antony (collection formerly at the Monastery of Our Lady of the Seeds at <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref>), the Chald. Patriarchate (incorporating collections from elsewhere in Iraq) and the Ch. of E. Archbishopric, as well as those in other ecclesiastical, public and private collections.</p>

<p>Bahdeidat is 12 km. northeast of Jbeil (Giblet or Byblos), 47 km. from <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>, 550 m. above sea level. The small church of Mar Tadros, which is nowadays Maronite, is built as a single barrel-vaulted nave with a wide, protruding porch open at the west end. It measures ca. 13x8 m. without the porch.</p>
<p>The east end is covered with a coherent program of wall paintings spilling over to the northern and southern walls of the nave. In the semi-dome is the Enthroned Christ in Majesty, with the Cherubim and Seraphim on either side, waving standards that give the words of the Trisagion. Behind the throne are the four beasts of the Apocalypse, the man (Matthew), the lion (Mark), the bull (Luke) and the eagle (John). Behind these are the standing figures of Mary and John the Baptist, their hands held out in supplication. The twelve apostles stand below this Vision, with the prophet Daniel at the northern end of the row and St. Stephen on the south.</p>
<p>The triumphal arch shows the Christ Emmanuel, between the Sacrifice of Isaac on the north and Moses Receiving the Tablets of the Law on the south. Below them are Mary and Gabriel of the Annunciation.</p>
<p>On the nave walls, on either side of the apse, is the equestrian knight St. Theodore spearing a dragon and the riding St. George, bearing the small water-carrier behind him. Both the equestrian knights are shown with donor portraits beneath the horses.</p>
<p>All the wall paintings are inscribed in a mixture of Serṭo and Esṭrangela.</p>
<p>These wall paintings represent the only comprehensive series of paintings executed by one workshop to have survived in Lebanon. In style they closely resemble the paintings of a church in the nearby village of <ref type="cr">Maʿad</ref>. According to a ms. in Dayr al-Shife, not far from Bahdeidat, a Syr. Orth. priest called Naʿman was ordained in Bahdeidat in 1256. This 13th-cent. date accords with the style of the paintings in both Bahdeidat and Maʿad and they belong to the Syr. Orth. tradition of painting, like the paintings of <ref type="cr">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>. At some point after the 13th cent. the church would have passed from the Syr. Orth. to the Maronites.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Balad, Assyrian Balaṭ, Syriac and Arabic Balad or Balaṭ, and modern Aski Mosul (Turkish for ‘Old Mosul’) are names referring to a town located some 40 km. northwest of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, on the west bank of the Tigris. Balad occurs in the inscriptions of the Assyrian king Sennacherib (BC 705–681), and in Syriac sources as part of the province of <ref type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>. In the late 5th cent. it became an E.-Syr. bishopric seat, beginning with bps Ḥawaḥ and Shubḥa l-Ishoʿ, who were present at the synod of Mar Babai that took place in <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> in 497. The long line of E.-Syr. bps. ended around 1364 with Aaron. Balad was also a Syr. Orth. bishopric seat, but only one bp., Mushe (mid 9th cent.), bore the title ‘bp. of Balad’. The other bishops may have resided in Dayr al-Muʿallaq ‘Hanging Monastery’, located some 15 km. from the city, on Mt. Buṭmān. They bore the title ‘bp. of Beth ʿArbaye’, having under their jurisdiction Sinjār and <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, in addition to Balad. The last bp. was called ‘of Sinjār’ and served in this rank between 1317 and 1345, a fact that led Patr. <ref type="cr">Afram Barsoum</ref> to date the final destruction of Balad to the 14th cent.

<p>Physician, scribe, and author of a Syriac-Arabic Lexicon. In spite of some confusion in the scholarly literature (see Butts), Ishoʿ bar ʿAli can in all likelihood be identified with ʿĪsā b. ʿAlī, student of the well-known translator <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873). From Arabic sources, it is known that he was the personal physician of Caliph al-Muʿtamid (r. 870–892), and that he authored two works (in Arabic) in the field of medicine, the ‘Book of the benefits made use of from the organs of animals’ and the ‘Book of poisons’. In addition, he is mentioned as a scribe in the colophon of two mss. of the Arabic Diatessaron (Vatican, Borg. Arab. 250; Oxford, Bodleian Arab. e 163).</p>
<p>Bar ʿAli is, however, best known for his Syriac-Arabic Lexicon (ed. Hoffmann [<cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>ālap</i>through <i>mim</i>]; Gottheil [<i>nun</i> through <i>taw</i>]). In the preface to his Lexicon, Bar ʿAli states that he undertook its writing at the behest of a certain deacon Abraham. During his readings, Abraham had been employing the Lexicon of Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq as well as a Lexicon compiled by <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ of Merv</ref>. Abraham seems to have been happy with the former, but less so with the latter. In addition, according to Abraham, the lexicon of Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq and that of Ishoʿ of Merv differed at times in their definitions. Thus, Bar ʿAli undertook composing a new lexicon on the basis of these two previous works and supplemented by his own readings. At the end of the Preface, Bar ʿAli exhorts his future readers to expand and supplement his Lexicon with additional words. The name of one such expander is known from a postscript found in some mss., and it is none other than the aforementioned deacon Abraham.</p>
<p>The Lexicon of Bar ʿAli is an important source for Syriac lexicography. Already in the 1830s, the Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer F. H. W. Gesenius pointed out the significance of Bar ʿAli’s Lexicon for Semitic studies. In addition, the Lexicon of Bar ʿAli — along with that of <ref type="cr">Ḥasan Bar Bahlul</ref> (mid-10th cent.) — was incorporated into R. Payne Smith’s <i>Thesaurus Syriacus</i>and, to a lesser extent, C. Brockelmann’s <i>Lexicon Syriacum</i>.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that Bar ʿAli is to be distinguished from two other individuals with similar names: 1. ʿĪsā b. ʿAlī, who was the son of the ‘good vizier’ ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā b. Dāʾūd b. al-Jarrāḥ (d. 946), who was a student of <ref type="cr">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (d. 974), and who died in 1001 (see J. L. Kraemer, <i>Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam. The cultural revival during the Buyid age</i> [1986], 134–36); 
2. ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā al-kaḥḥāl, who authored the ‘Prescription of Oculists’ (<i>tadhkirat al-kaḥḥālīn</i>), who was a student of <ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043), and who died sometime after 1010 (see E. Mittwoch, in <i>EI</i><sup>2</sup>, vol. 1, 388).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Bar Bahlul, Ḥasan</head><ab type="infobox"/>(mid-10th cent.) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>Scholar and lexicographer. Born in Awāna, ca. 60 km. north of <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>, in the region of Ṭirhan, Bar Bahlul spent most of his life in Baghdad and belonged to the Christian intellectual elite, who interacted with Muslim scholars and were thoroughly bilingual. Bar Bahlul used both Syriac and Arabic in his publications. He was involved in the election of Cath. ʿAbdishoʿ I in 963.</p>
<p>Bar Bahlul’s Lexicon (Syr. <i>Leksiqon</i>) deals with scholarly and technical terminology and includes both Syriac words and Greek words in Syriac transliteration. The explanations are primarily in Syriac, but mostly contain equivalents and/or short comments in Arabic. Common Syriac words are normally not included. The words are taken from the Bible as well as from theological, philosophical, and scientific writings; a number of proper names are included as well. The words are in alphabetical order, even though Bar Bahlul occasionally groups together Syriac words that are based on the same root. The Lexicon brings the Syriac tradition of lexico­graphy to full fruition. In composing it, Bar Bahlul heavily relied on two works by <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873) — 
a work on homographs and a no longer extant lexicon proper (<i>puššāq šmāhe</i>) — as well as on a no longer extant lexicon by <ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ bar Seroshway</ref> (ca. 900).</p>
<p>By way of these main sources and through personal reading Bar Bahlul included in his work words culled from many different authors and texts of Greek, Syriac, and Arabic origin. Some Syr. Orth. authors are occasionally quoted as well, such as <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Mushe bar Kipho</ref>, along with a few non-Christian works, such as the Proverbs of the <ref type="cr">Arameans</ref> (<i>matle d-Ārāmāye</i>) — a title that reminds one of the <ref type="cr">Aḥiqar</ref> proverbs — and <ref type="cr">Kalila and Dimna</ref>. Bar Bahlul also provides rare information on dialectal variation within the Syriac language of his day, referring, among others, to the languages of <ref type="cr">Beth Aramaye</ref>, <ref type="cr">Beth Qaṭraye</ref>, <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>, <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> (Atur), Gazarta, <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>. Several words, expressions, names, and titles of works are known to us only through Bar Bahlul’s Lexicon, which has rightly been called a ‘linguistic and cultural encyclopedia’ (Ḥabbi). Preserved in both E.- and W.-Syr. mss., much of the information of the ‘Lexicon’ was incorporated in the modern dictionaries of R. Payne Smith and, to a lesser extent, of C. Brockelmann.</p>
<p>Another work by Bar Bahlul became known only a few decades ago. His ‘Book of signs’ (<i>Kitāb al-dalāʾil</i>), written in Arabic between 942 and 968, has the same encyclopedic breadth as the Lexicon. Probably intended as a manual for travelers, it deals with issues of calendar and, among other things, lists the festivals and commemorative days of Christians, Muslims (arranged according to the lunar months), Jews, Armenians, Copts, the people of Ḥarran, and the Sabians. Of particular importance is Bar Bahlul’s insider information on the feasts of the 
Ch. of E. Toward the end, the scope of this work broadens; a final section on dream interpretation has been identified as a summary rewriting of the dream manual written by the Muslim author Ibn Qutayba (d. 889).</p>

The synod held in Cilicia following the death of Patr. <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon bar Maʿdani</ref> in 1264 saw the double election of Ignatius IV Yeshuʿ (Patr. 1264–82) to the patriarchate and of Bar ʿEbroyo to the maphrianate. Bar ʿEbroyo’s normal place of residence as maph. was <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> and the nearby <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>, but a significant part of his maphrianate was spent in Maragha and Tabriz, the new centers of power and learning under the Mongol Īl-Khāns, where Bar ʿEbroyo befriended the leading Muslim scholars of the day. During his maphrianate Bar ʿEbroyo ordained a total of twelve bishops, including his biographer 
<ref type="cr">Diosqoros of Gozarto</ref>, and saw his erstwhile disciple Philoxenos Nemrod<ref type="cr"></ref>(Patr. 1283–92) elected to the patriarchate in 1283. He also entertained a friendly relationship with his Ch. of E. counterparts Denḥa I (Cath. 1265–81) and <ref type="cr">Yahbalaha III</ref>. Bar ʿEbroyo died in Maragha on 29/30 July 1286. His remains were later transferred to Dayro d-Mor Matay, where they rest to this day together with those of his younger brother and successor in the maphrianate, <ref type="cr">Grigorios Barṣawmo Ṣafī</ref>.</p>
<p>Bar ʿEbroyo composed over forty works covering a wide range of subjects, mostly in Syriac, but occasionally also in Arabic. Taken as a whole, Bar ʿEbroyo’s literary output may be seen as an attempt at a revival of learning in Syriac through the use of the latest scholarly literature which was available in his day mostly in Arabic. Bar ʿEbroyo frequently modelled his works on works of Arabic and Persian authors (e.g. Ibn Sīnā, Ghazālī, Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī) and incorporated into the framework provided by these models materials taken from both Arabo-Persian and Syriac sources, thus making a new synthesis out of the older Syriac and more recent Arabo-Persian literature. Bar ʿEbroyo has often been characterised as a skillful but unoriginal compiler of earlier works. This is a characterization that overlooks the originality to be found in his choice of sources and in his openness to the knowledge found in the works of Islamic scholars and those of other Christian denominations. His works were to remain for a long time the standard texts in many fields not only among the Christians of the W.-Syr. tradition but also among those of the E.-Syr. and Maron. traditions. Many of his works were later translated into Arabic, most notably by <ref type="cr">Daniel of Mardin</ref> (1326/7 – after 1382) and Grigorios Yūḥannā b. al-Ghurayr al-Zurbābī<ref type="cr"></ref>(Bp. of Damascus 1668–84).</p>

<p>Disciple of <ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref>; monastic leader. Bar ʿEdta is credited with the foundation of an important monastery, probably in 561 (or 571). The location of this monastery, which traditionally was assumed to be to the north of the village of Tarjilla, ca. 6 km. east/northeast of <ref type="cr">Karamlish</ref> (near <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>), was questioned by Fiey, who argued instead for a location in the district of Marga, near the river Khāzir. This monastery is said to have had as many as 400 monks. Bar ʿEdta’s life is known ­primarily through a metrical composition by Abraham Zabaya (from the region near the river Zab), who wrote at the request of the metropolitan Bp. ʿAbdishoʿ (who might have been <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</ref>, even though it cannot be ruled out that we are dealing with an 11th-cent. namesake). Abraham mentions as his main source a prose narrative by Bar ʿEdta’s disciple Yoḥannan the Persian. Bar ʿEdta also features prominently in <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>’s ‘Book of chastity’ and is discussed both in <ref type="cr">Toma of Marga</ref>’s ‘Book of governors’ and in the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>. Among Bar ʿEdta’s many disciples was Rabban Hormizd. Bar ʿEdta thus played an important role in the transmission of E.-Syr. monastic ideals.</p>

<p>Earliest known Syriac author. He was active at the court of Abgar VIII (177–212) in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, where the chronicler Julius Africanus met him in 195 (<i>Kestoi</i> I.20), and recorded his skill at archery. Bardaiṣan’s name derives from that of the river Daiṣan (Greek <i>Skirtos</i> ‘Leaper’) which in his day flowed through Edessa. His own writings, which included works against <ref type="cr">Marcion</ref> and the Chaldeans (that is, astrologers), are unfortunately lost, since his views on cosmology were later considered unorthodox. What survives is a philosophical dialogue on fate and freewill in which Bardaiṣan is the protagonist; this work, probably by his pupil Philip, is generally known as the ‘Book of the Laws of the Countries’, due to a section on ethnography (whose accuracy in the passage on Ḥaṭra is now confirmed by a Ḥaṭran inscription, no. 281). The work was translated into Greek, and quotations from it are given in <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref>’s ‘<i>Preparation for the Gospel</i>’ (VI.10.1–48) and the ‘Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions’ (IX.19–29). His teaching, some of which was conveyed in verse as well as in prose, has to be reconstructed from later hostile sources (above all, <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>); it was evidently syncretistic in character, with elements drawn from Greek philosophy and Iranian and Gnostic cosmology; it may have served <ref type="cr">Mani</ref> as a partial model. The teaching on freewill in the ‘Book of the Laws of the Countries’ has been shown to be largely dependent on Alexander of Aphrodisias.</p>

<p>A member of the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> in the latter part of the 6th cent., who may have composed two of the most important sources for this institution: the Ecclesiastical History and the so-called ‘Cause of the Foundation of the Schools’. The former is a church history, composed not long after 569, focusing on the 4th and 5th cent. from an E.-Syr. perspective (but relying on Western Greek sources). In its concluding two chapters it traces the history of the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref> and the School of Nisibis up to the death of <ref type="cr">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref>, head of the School of Nisibis (d. 569). Scholars have commonly equated this text, entitled in the one surviving ms. as ‘History of the Holy Fathers, persecuted on account of the truth’, with the Ecclesiastical History mentioned by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> (see below). The ‘Cause’ attributed to Barḥadbshabba, composed between 581 and ca. 610, begins with a treatment of epistemology and then provides a history of learning from the time of God’s creation of the world to the period of the text’s composition in the late 6th cent. It recasts patriarchal, Israelite, ‘pagan’, and Christian history as a long series of schools, concluding with the leadership of <ref type="cr">Ḥenana</ref> (ca.  572 – 
ca. 610), whom Barḥadbshabba views favorably.</p>
<p>These two texts have both been attributed to a Barḥadbshabba, but scholars have not agreed about his identity and whether he is one and the same person. Two contemporary figures named Barḥadbshabba are attested in the sources: Barḥadbshabba ʿArbaya (i.e. from <ref type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>) and Barḥadbshabba of Ḥulwān (in the mountains northeast of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon)</ref>. Their identification is supported by their contemporaneity, their mutual connection to <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> and Ḥenana, the common subject matter of their surviving works, and the lack of positive evidence to the contrary, though it is far from certain that they are one and the same person. It is possible that a Barḥadbshabba from the region of Beth <ref type="cr">ʿ</ref>Arbaye came to Nisibis and was eventually consecrated Bp. of Ḥulwān, in which case the two are actually one and the same person, as some scholars believe. To the former ʿAbdishoʿ attributes: ‘a book of treasures in three parts, and disputes (<i>drāše</i>) with all religions (<i>deḥlān</i>) and their refutation, and an ecclesiastical (history), and a cause of the followers (Syr. <i>bet</i>, or ‘school’) of Diodore, and a commentary (<i>mašlmānutā</i>) on Mark the evangelist and (the psalms of) David’. A late ms. attributes a hymn to the same person (ms. Cambridge Or. Oo. 1. 22). Perhaps the commentary on Psalms mentioned by ʿAbdishoʿ is the source of the quotation attributed to a Barḥadbshabba in a later psalm commentary (ms. Mingana Syr. 58). <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref> cites a ‘Book of Treasures’, which he attributes to Barḥadbshabba the teacher (<i>mallpān</i><i>ā</i>), probably the same person. The ‘Cause of the Followers of Diodore’ may be a recherché reference to the ‘Cause of the Foundation of the Schools’ (since there were never any formal group of followers of Diodore. Presumably this is <ref type="cr">Diodore of Tarsus</ref>). The ms. tradition of the ‘Cause’ does not help us identify the author, since the more reliable mss. were lost in 1915. The text would have been written perhaps before the mid-590s if the author is identical with the Barḥadbshabba who participated in opposing Ḥenana at the Synod of 605 and left the School some time after, particularly since Ḥenana is highly praised in the ‘Cause’. The Khuzistan Chronicle refers to a person by the name of Barḥadbshabba of Ḥulwān, known for his compositions in the early 7th cent (Guidi et al., <i>Chronica minora</i> [CSCO 1], 22). The same person is also one of the signatories to the record for the Synod of <ref type="cr">Grigor I</ref> of 605, at which the theological authority of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> was re-affirmed (Synodicon Orientale, 471–9). This has been taken by some scholars to be an implicit rejection of Ḥenana. The Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref> suggests that these two figures are the same, but this may be a later conflation. Significantly, the text states that ‘Ḥadbshabba ʿArbaya who became metropolitan of Ḥulwān’ was one of the members who left the School of Nisibis due to the controversial theo­logy of Ḥenana. Some later sources, such as the 9th-cent. biblical commentator <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> and the later <ref type="cr">Gannat bussāme</ref> (‘Garden of Delights’, a commentary on the E.-Syr. lectionary) refer to a Barḥadbshabba without any appellation, and this may also be the same person.</p>

<LemmaTitle>Barṣawma of Nisibis</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. ca. 491–96) [Ch. of E.]
<p>Controversial E.-Syr. Bp. of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>. After spending time at the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref>, Barṣawma was made metropolitan bp. of Nisibis (ca. 459, or perhaps as early as 435) by the Cath. Babowai (457–484/6). The shah Peroz (457–84) showed a liking to him and may have even commissioned him to officiate in matters pertaining to border security, even entrusting him with troops. Later Miaphysite sources suggest that he used this force against his theological enemies, but there seems to be an exaggeration in this account. Until Gero’s work, scholars generally believed the W.-Syr. characterization of Barṣawma as playing an important role in the so-called ‘nestorianization’ of the Ch. of E. For example, <ref type="cr">Shemʿun of Beth Arsham</ref>’s letter on the spread of Dyophysitism across the Sasanian Empire was published by Assemani as ‘On Barṣawma, Bishop of Nisibis, and the heresy of the Nestorians’, although it only mentions him twice and in passing. To what extent he played a central role in the propagation of Dyophysite Christology in the Ch. of  E. is unclear, but it seems certain that he was involved in some of the major ecclesiastical developments of the day. For example, he may have initiated the founding of the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>. The sources describe him as persuading <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref> to found the new school in Nisibis after the expulsion of the Dyophysites from the School of Edessa in the last decades of the 5th cent. Barṣawma engaged in a project of ethical reform, which included granting permission for clergy to marry. He later had a falling out with Narsai, perhaps in part due to his marriage to an ex-nun, Mamai. He openly opposed the Cath. Babowai and called together a synod at <ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref> in 484, which did not include the Cath. This was followed by a synod at Beth ʿEdray (?) in 486. We have extant a letter from Barṣawma explaining his absence from the Synod of Mar <ref type="cr">Aqaq</ref>, held in 486, which further addressed the issues of clerical marriage. <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> is vague about his works, citing various genres, including metrical homilies, liturgical works, and epistles (Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 3.1, 66). Gero provides a possible chronology for his several extant letters.</p>

<Author>A. H. Becker</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Barṣawmo</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. ca. 458) [Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Monk and abbot. Barṣawmo was a supporter of Dioscorus of Alexandria. In 449, invited by Emperor Theodosius II, he attended the Council of Ephesus, which accepted a profession of faith by <ref type="cr">Eutyches</ref>. Two years later, Barṣawmo also was present at the Council of Chalcedon, which rejected Eutyches’s views and deposed Dioscorus. Barṣawmo expressed his strong opposition to the decisions of this council and remained opposed to the council for the rest of his life. It is explicitly stated that Barṣawmo spoke Syriac in both councils and that his words were translated into Greek.</p>
<p>Aside from his brief appearance at these two councils, recorded in the Greek Acts of the Council of Chalcedon and in the Syriac Acts of the Council of Ephesus, no further contemporary evidence on Barṣawmo exists. Around the middle of the 6th cent., however, a Syriac Life was composed, which situates Barṣawmo’s birth in the region of Samosata and details his many travels to 
<ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>, Petra, the Sinai, and Cyprus. Barṣawmo is portrayed as an energetic monk, converting non-Christians and fighting against Jews and pagans. The historical value of this Life, preserved in three incomplete mss. (the earliest from the 11th cent.), is doubtful. In his Chronicle, <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, who was abbot in the monastery named after Barṣawmo (see <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref>), fails to record many of the data provided in the Life.</p>
<p>Despite his acceptance of Eutyches, whose legacy was later rejected by the Syr. Orth. Church, Barṣawmo became a popular saint. He gave his name to the famous Monastery of Barṣawmo, near <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>. Barṣawmo’s fame also spread to the Coptic and Ethiopian churches.</p>
<p>Barṣawmo is depicted in an illuminated ms. of the <ref type="cr">Ḥarqlean</ref> Gospels (dated 1054) that once belonged to the Monastery of Barṣawmo and later was in the possession of the Syr. Orth. patriarchal library at <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref>. He is also portrayed in Coptic wall paintings in the Monastery of Baramus and in the Monastery of St. Antony. In the latter he holds an open scroll, which is inscribed partly in Syriac and partly in Coptic.</p>

<p>The monastery, situated in the mountains to the southeast of <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>and named after the 5th-cent. ascetic <ref type="cr">Barṣawmo</ref>, rose to prominence as the regular residence of Syr. Orth. Patriarchs in the 11th–13th cent., the period often referred to as the <ref type="cr">Syriac Renaissance</ref>. The ruins of the fortified monastery have been located around a peak 1600 m high at the south-western end of the Kaplı Dağı, above the village of Peraş (1300  m) in the upper valley of the Kâhta Çayı and approximately 20 km. to the northeast of Nemrut Dağı, the site of the ancient sanctuary built by Antiochus I of Commagene (70–38 BC), whence the materials may have been brought that were used in the construction of the vaults of the new church of the monastery in 1186 (Honigmann, 49).</p>
<p>The original monastery founded by Mor Barṣawmo probably lay at the foot of the mountain near the Kâhta Çayı. The ‘upper’ monastery must have been built before 790 when Patr.<ref type="cr"> Giwargis of Bʿeltan</ref>is said to have ascended there to die. After the large-scale movement of Syr. Orth. Christians into the area around Melitene in the 10th cent., Patr. Yuḥanon da-Srigteh (965–986) and Athanasios Ṣalḥoyo (987–1003) normally resided at the Monastery of Barid, which was probably located near the River Giḥun (Ceyhan) some way to the west of Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, but Athanasios is recorded as having died in Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, and was succeeded by Yuḥanon bar ʿAbdun (1004–31), a monk of that monastery. Patr. Dionysios IV (1032–42) was forced to seek refuge in <ref type="cr">Amid</ref> because of persecution by Chalcedonians, and, with the exception of Athanasios  Ḥoye (1058–63), his immediate successors normally resided outside areas under Byzantine rule, but with the weakening of Byzantine control in the wake of the Battle of Manzikert (1071), Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo and the surrounding region became once again the center stage of Syr. Orth. activities. Among the patriarchs from that period, Basilios III (1074–75) and Athanasios bar Kamore (1091–1129) were monks of Mor Barṣawmo. It is reported that measures were taken to strengthen the fortification of the monastery in 1101 and 1164, measures which were necessitated by the attraction that the monastery with its relic of Barṣawmo and its wealth exerted not only on pilgrims but also on less welcome visitors, as well as by its precarious position on the border between Frankish and Armenian territory to the south and Turkish territory to the north. Among the events from the middle of the 12th cent., mention may be made of the plunder of the monastery by Count Joscelin II of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> in 1148 and the synod held there in 1155 under Athanasios VI bar Qeṭreh (1138/9–66). The monastery saw its heyday under Patr. <ref type="cr">Michael I Rabo</ref> (1166–99), who had been its abbot before his election as patr. The monastery, which became the regular venue for synods under Michael  I, suffered serious damage by fire in 1183. Michael I was succeeded as patr. by another abbot of Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, Rabban Ṣaliba, who as patr. took the name Athanasios (1199–1207), while his rival <ref type="cr">Michael II the Younger</ref>, a nephew of Michael I, had also been educated in the monastery. Patriarchs begin to reside less frequently at Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo in the following period. Ignatius III Dawid (1222–52), although originally a monk of the monastery, spent much of his patriarchate in Armenian and Frankish territory at Qal<LemmaTitle>ʿ</LemmaTitle>a Rumoyto (Hromklay, Rum Kale) and <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. In the schism following his death Dionysios <LemmaTitle>ʿ</LemmaTitle>Angur (1252–61) took up residence in the monastery and was joined there for a time by <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, who was to revisit the monastery as maphrian on at least two occasions. Patr. Ignatius IV Yeshuʿ (1264–83) had to engage in a long dispute over the control of the monastery with its abbot Yaʿqub and his influential brother Shem<LemmaTitle>ʿ</LemmaTitle>un of Qal<LemmaTitle>ʿ</LemmaTitle>a Rumoyto. His successor Philoxenos Nemrod (1283–92), a nephew of Shem<LemmaTitle>ʿ</LemmaTitle>un and Ya<LemmaTitle>ʿ</LemmaTitle>qub, seems normally to have resided in Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, which was badly damaged by an earthquake in 1284/5, and it was there that <ref type="cr">Barṣawmo Ṣafī</ref>, the younger brother of Bar ʿEbroyo, was consecrated maphrian in 1288. The monastery seems to have been deserted not long after the murder in 1293 of Constantine, the Melitenian patriarchal claimant in the three-way schism that followed the death of Philoxenos, and, after the extinction also of the Cilician line of patriarchs, was replaced by <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> near <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> as the normal residence of Syr. Orth. Patriarchs.</p>
<p>The 15th cent. saw a revival of Syr. Orth. activities in the area just to the east of Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, centred around the town of Gargar (modern Gerger) and the Monastery of Mor Abḥai. Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, too, was reoccupied at that time, as is indicated by a number of manuscripts dated between 1463 and 1675 that either mention or were copied in Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo. There has been yet another revival of Syr. Orth. communities in the area in recent years, leading to the appointment of a metropolitan for Adıyaman (former Ḥisn Manṣūr) in 2006.</p>
<p>Another Syr. Orth. monastery dedicated to Mor Barṣawmo was the ‘little monastery’ (<i>dayrunitho</i>) of Mor Barṣawmo near Kfartuto to the southwest of Mardin, which is attested in 12th–13th cent. and was situated between the villages of Bagdashiyya (modern Bektaş) and Ḥashray (modern Dikmen) (Honigmann, 44–5; and colophons of mss. Vat. Syr. 147 and Yale, Syriac 10).</p>

[Syr. Orth.]
<p>Younger brother of Grigorios Abū al-Faraj <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> and his successor as <ref type="cr">maphrian</ref> (1288–1307/8). Almost all we know about Barṣawmo comes from his elder brother’s Ecclesiastical History, or, rather, from the continuations of that work, parts of which were composed by Barṣawmo himself. Some details not mentioned there, such as Barṣawmo’s role in the continuation of the building work at the Monastery of Bar Nagore in <ref type="cr">Barṭelle</ref> and the construction of an aqueduct at <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>, can be supplied from an incompletely preserved metrical biography, composed as a sequel to the biography of the elder Bar ʿEbroyo by <ref type="cr">Diosqoros of Gozarto</ref>. Barṣawmo was no doubt in the company of his elder brother for most of the time during the latter’s maphrianate and was with him when he died in Maragha in 1286. Barṣawmo was consecrated Maph. of the East two years later on 3 July 1288, taking the episcopal name of ‘Gregory’ in remembrance of his brother, and ruled over his flock in a time of increasing political instability and persecutions for the Christians. Barṣawmo died in Barṭelle in 1307/8, and was entombed in Dayro d-Mor Matay alongside his brother. Besides the continuations of his brother’s historical works, Barsoum ascribes to Barṣawmo an abridgement of the Anaphora of St. John the Evangelist.</p>

In 1913, he embarked on a scholarly trip in the <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> region studying local mss. He was consecrated bp. of Syria in 1918 and resided in <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref>; later Lebanon was added to his diocese. In 1919 he represented his church at the Paris Peace Conference and embarked on a second scholarly trip across Europe where he spent 17 months visiting libraries that hold Syriac mss. In 1927, he embarked on a third scholarly trip visiting Europe and the US, where he consecrated three churches in Worcester, MA, Patterson, NJ, and Rhode Island. During his stay there, he visited the University of Chicago where he worked at the Oriental Institute. In 1932 he became a member of the Syrian Academy. In 1933, he was elected and consecrated Patr., and transferred the Patriarchate to Ḥimṣ. He established in 1939 the Seminary of Saint Ephrem. He authored numerous books, published Syriac texts, and translated Syriac texts into Arabic.</p>
<p>His main works include <i>al-Luʾluʾ al-Manthūr</i> (Ḥimṣ 1943, 2nd ed. Aleppo 1956), a historical survey of Syriac literature and sciences (ET by M.

<p>Educator, modern writer, and translator of liturgical texts into English. He was born an orphan in Miden (his father perished in a storm on his way to purchase a sack of wheat from a nearby village while his mother was pregnant with him). His mother died a few hours after giving birth to him, after which his grandmother took care of him. His family immigrated to Palestine after World War I. After a rough childhood, his family entrusted him to the care of <ref type="cr">St. Mark’s Monastery</ref> in 1925. There he studied Syriac under <ref type="cr">Dolabani</ref>. Barsoum published a small pedagogical reader at the age of fifteen, and taught at the Syr. Orth. schools of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>, Bethlehem, and Amman. During World War II, he worked as an interpreter for the British Government for the <ref type="cr">Assyrians</ref> who were then deported from Iraq. After the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, Barsoum became a refugee for the third time and lived in Bethlehem. In 1955 he immigrated to Jordan and in 1966 to the USA. In 1984, he went on a pilgrimage to his homeland <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> with <ref type="cr">Athanasios Yeshuʿ Samuel</ref>. He died in Los Angeles in 1996. His family established a small library to contain his library at St. Ephrem’s Cathedral, Burbank. His works include a pedagogical reader (Jerusalem, 1927); translations into English of the orders of baptism, matrimony, and burial (1974), and thirteen Anaphoras (1991); editions, with English translation, of a short daily prayer book (1993), and a prayer book for the clergy (1993).

<Author>G. A. Kiraz</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Basil of Caesarea</head><ab type="infobox"/>(ca. 330–379) 
<p>Bp. of Caesarea and Greek author. Basil was one of the three great Cappadocian Fathers, and the brother of Gregory of Nyssa and Macrina. He was appointed bp. of Caesarea in Cappadocia in 370, and according to the 6th-cent. ‘Life of Ephrem’ he was visited by <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>; the episode, however, is legendary and is based on a misidentification of an anonymous ‘Syrian’ in Basil’s writings (the Syrian is now known to have been <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Emesa</ref>, who was born in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>). Many of Basil’s writings (in Greek) were translated into Syriac (sometimes twice, first in the 5th, and then again in the 6th/7th cent.: the earlier translations were often very free, whereas the later ones keep much closer to the Greek originals).</p>
<p>The following are the more important works translated into Syriac:</p>
<p>1. ‘Homilies on the Hexaemeron’ (<i>CPG</i> 2835): ed. with ET, R. W. Thomson (CSCO 550–1; 1995). This early (and rather free) translation was in turn translated into Armenian.</p>
<p>2. ‘Treatise on the Holy Spirit’ (<i>CPG</i> 2839): ed. with ET, D. G. K. Taylor (CSCO 576–7; 1999). Only the older version is preserved complete, in three very old mss.; of the later version there are only quotations.</p>
<p>3. Homilies (<i>CPG</i> 2845–69): these are mostly preserved in both an early and a later translation; they remain unpublished. Some of these homilies were incorporated into the liturgical Homiliaries.</p>
<p>4. Small Asceticon (<i>CPG</i> 2876): the Syriac version, which is entitled ‘Questions to the Brethren’, is a particularly important witness to this work, since the only other witness is the Latin translation by Rufinus (d. ca. 401), the Greek original having been lost (only the Great Asceticon survives in Greek). The early Syriac translation, preserved in a number of early mss., has not yet been published apart from excerpts (by J. Gribomont).</p>
<p>5. Letters (<i>CPG</i> 2900). 18 Letters from Basil’s very large correspondence survive in Syriac translation. Letter 2, addressed to <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, on the monastic life, was much read, to judge by the number of mss. preserving it (some mss. identify the addressee as Gregory of Nyssa, and in others a further text of unknown origin has been added to it). Only two of the Letters have so far been published: Letter 38 (in fact probably not by Basil but by his brother Gregory of Nyssa, <i>CPG</i> 3196), by M. Parmentier, in <i>Studien zu Gregor von Nyssa</i>, ed. H.  Drobner and C. Klock (1990), 17–55. and (independently) M. Albert, in <i>ARAM</i> 5 (1993), 33–64; and Letter 160, by A. Vööbus, in <i>The Synodicon in the West Syrian Tradition</i> (CSCO 367–8; 1975), 189–94 (Syr.), 178–82 (ET). (An edition of Letter 2 is in preparation).</p>
<p>6. A few texts attributed to Basil in Syriac are unknown in Greek. This applies to: a. A homily against the Anomoeans (<i>CPG</i> 2988.14 Suppl.), ed. with LT by A. Van Roey, in <i>OLP</i> 28 (1997), 179–91. b. 6 letters, one of which, addressed to the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Tell</ref> <ref type="cr">ʿAda</ref>, has been edited by M. Albert, in <i>After Bardaisan</i>, ed. Reinink and Klugkist (OLA 89), 11–22. c. A narrative poem, clearly composed in Syriac, on the biblical patriarch Joseph and his brothers; this has been published in two parts, by M. Weinberg (1893) and S. W. Link (1895). ET by K. Heal in preparation; there are Arabic and Ethiopic translations.</p>
<p>7. Various liturgical texts are ascribed to Basil in Syriac: a. A translation of the Greek Anaphora of Basil, found in Rum Orthodox liturgical mss.; b. A (different) Syr. Orth, and Maron. Anaphora; c. The Melkite (Rum Orthodox) baptismal rite; d. A short Maronite baptismal rite.</p>
<p>Besides works by Basil, Syriac also preserves some hagiographical texts concerning Basil.</p>
<p>He is commemorated on 1 Jan.</p>

<p>Missionary and scholar. Paul Bedjan was born and raised in Khosrowa, northwest Iran, in a Chald. family with strong ties to the Lazarist mission (St. Vincent de Paul) whose missionaries had established themselves in that town in 1840. Bedjan received his primary education at their seminary and in 1856 traveled to Paris to enter the order and continue his education. In 1861 he returned to Iran where he worked as a missionary until 1880, when he left again for Europe, living in Paris, Ans-les-Lièges, Seraing (Belgium), and Köln Nippes (Germany), never to return to Iran. Several times Iranian clergy and lay people attempted to make Bedjan bp. of Khosrowa, but due to opposition from the Chald. patriarchate in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, partly the result of the discussions that surrounded Bedjan’s edition of the Chaldean Breviary, as well as to Bedjan’s preference for Europe, this never materialized. Despite his estrangement from the Chald. hierarchy and his latinizing tendencies, Bedjan succeeded in the prime object of his stay in Europe: to provide books for the Chald. community in Iran, among other things to counteract the influence of the publications of the Protestant press in <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref>. He published thirty-two classical Syriac works and wrote eight books in the vernacular language of Urmia, as it had developed in the first half of the 19th cent. These include a translation of the ‘Imitation of Christ’ of Thomas à Kempis (1885), a retelling of the Bible (<i>Histoire Sainte</i>, 1888), devotional texts on Mary (<i>Mois de Marie</i>, 1904) and a shortened version of the Saints’ lives (<i>Vies des Saints</i>, 1912). It was through his classical Syriac editions, among which the seven-volume collection of Saints’ Lives, the History of Mar Yahbalaha, and works of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, <ref type="cr">Toma of Marga</ref>, <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, that his name became known also to western scholars, with some of whom he co-operated. All of his books were published by Otto Harrasowitz in Leipzig and/or in Paris and shipped in thousands to the Middle East.</p>

<p>Situated ca. 36 km. southeast of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, Dayro d-Mor Behnam contains the only full program of medieval church decoration that survives to this day in Iraq. The monastery consists of a fortress-like complex, the main buildings of which are the monastic church and a separate octagonal mausoleum housing the relics of Mor Behnam, which is commonly referred to as either the ‘Pit’ or the ‘Outside Martyrion’. The entire complex is known in Syriac as <i>Beth Gubbā</i>, and in Arabic as <i>Dayr al-Jubb</i>, ‘Monastery of the Pit’. According to the legend of Mor Behnam (ed. P. Bedjan, <i>AMS</i>, vol. II, 397–441), the monastery was built in the 4th cent. on the site of the graves of the martyrs Behnam and his sister Sarah. The first secure evidence for its existence is encountered in the 12th cent., in the first place in a dedicatory inscription which states that the ‘altar’ (probably meaning the entire altar room) was reconstructed in 1164, which suggests that the church existed well before this date. These reconstruction activities may have occasioned the writing down of the legend of Mor Behnam. The oldest written account is preserved in a Syr. Orth. ms. (London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,174), which was copied in 1197 for <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref> near <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>, and contains a note by Patr. <ref type="cr">Michael I Rabo</ref>.</p>
<p>Whatever the exact nature of the restoration work executed at Dayro d-Mor Behnam in 1164, less than a century later the monastery was the site of large-scale refurbishment activities, probably through the involvement of monks from <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>, with which the monastery appears to have maintained close administrative and economic ties. Most of the monastic church’s extensive sculptural decoration and architectural features closely resemble those encountered in monuments dating from the reign of Badr al-Dīn Luʾluʾ, the Atabeg ruler of Mosul, and may therefore be dated between ca. 1233 and 1259. Obviously benefiting from the economic and cultural boom in the Mosul area during this period, the interior and exterior of the church were both provided with new stone carving. Three domes with interior stucco decoration probably also date from this period of artistic activity. In addition to motifs familiar from contemporary Islamic contexts, such as lions and dragons, the decoration program conveys distinctively Christian themes, including equestrian saints, martyrs, and monks, as well as two scenes based on the life of Mor Behnam.</p>
<p>Along with the extensive figural decoration, the numerous <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref> situated on the walls of the monastic church and the mausoleum, which date from the 12th through the 20th cent. are of particular importance to the study of Syriac Christianity. Mainly written in Syriac, but also in Arabic, Armenian, and Uighur, these inscriptions not only include liturgical texts and biblical verses, but also historical information, as well as names of artists and patrons. According to one of these inscriptions, the monastery was looted in 1295 by the invading Mongol army of Khan Baidu. The abbot of the monastery was subsequently able to persuade Baidu not only to return all the stolen objects, but even to make a donation, which was apparently used for the construction of a new grave for the relics of Mor Behnam, built in the mausoleum in 1300. In the 15th and 16th cent., several Maphrians chose Dayro d-Mor Behnam as their seat, including Diosqoros Behnam II (1415–17), whose grave is still found in the monastery’s burial room. In 1579/80, Maphr. Basilius Pilatus (1576–91) wrote a letter from the monastery to Pope Gregory XIII (1572–85) in which he expressed interest in establishing a formal union with the Church of Rome.</p>
<p>Having suffered a long period of decline, the monastery was finally brought under the jurisdiction of the <ref type="cr">Syriac Catholic Church</ref>in 1839, but continued to lead a poor existence until 1936, when Ephrem Abdal established a new community of monks there. In addition to revitalizing Dayro d-Mor Behnam’s library, superior Abdal (1936–66) initiated the first of a series of large-scale restorations, which were continued by his successors, in particular during the 1980s and 1990s. Today, the monastery is one of the most flourishing Christian sites in the Mosul area.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Beirut, Lebanon is mentioned in many Syr. Orth. texts in connection with the St. Jude monastery and church. It was described by <ref type="cr">Zacharias Rhetor</ref>in his ‘Life of <ref type="cr">Severus</ref>’, the Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> (512–38). Although Zacharias wrote originally in Greek, his text survives only in Syriac translation. The author narrates Severus’s conversion to Christianity while both he and Severus were studying at the famous School of Law in 487–91, and he gives a lively description of the lives of young Christians in 5th cent. Beirut. He mentions four churches in Beirut among which was a ‘venerable church of the holy apostle Jude, brother of James who were both sons of Joseph’. It was located outside of Beirut and had a community of ascetics, priests, and monks. Different sources show that the community was anti-Chalcedonian. Severus himself in one of his letters reports that in 482–83, when <ref type="cr">Peter the Iberian</ref>, a popular anti-Chalcedonian figure in Palestine, passed by Beirut, he prayed in ‘the glorious church of the famous martyr and apostle Jude, brother of James who is buried in Berytus’. In the early Syr. Orth. tradition, therefore, Beirut’s church of St. Jude was known for being a martyrium church as well as having an anti-Chalcedonian stance. Medieval Syr. Orth. authors like <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>and <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> support these claims. The monastery apparently survived the earthquake of 551 that destroyed Beirut entirely, including its famous Law School, although Michael Rabo in his Chronicle describes the effects of the earthquake without mentioning the church. It was probably rebuilt eventually by Syr. Orth. monks because in a 12th cent. papal letter a church of St. Jude in Beirut is mentioned, which was put under the jurisdiction of the Latin bishop of the city. The church was destroyed by the army of Ṣalāḥ al-dīn al-Ayyūbī who occupied Beirut for ten years (1187–97), for when the German pilgrim Wilbrand of Oldenburg visited Beirut in 1211–12, he found only the tombs of Jude and his brother Simon in place of the monastery outside the walls of the city.</p>
<p>A <ref type="cr">Maronite</ref> presence in Beirut is mentioned for the first time in a papal confirmation of 1184. It reports that the Latin bishop of Beirut gave the Maronites a chapel with adjacent land (see Pringle). This may have been the church of Saint Georges located northeast of the city and cited by an anonymous Rhenan pilgrim in 1098. It is there, the pilgrim affirms, that long ago Saint George killed the dragon. Under the Ottomans in the 16th cent., the Maronites were in possession of that church with an adjacent cemetery where their bishops were buried (Duwayhī). In the course of the 17th cent. they lost this church, which became the mosque of al-Khidr. Another Maronite church was located within the walls of Beirut, but it was taken from them in 1571 by the ruling local emir Manṣūr ʿAssāf in the aftermath of his participation in the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus. ʿAssāf seized the church, but the Maronites did not leave, and they even named their first known bishop of Beirut a few years later, in 1577. Maronite bps. were named for Beirut but did not reside in the city, staying instead in different monasteries of the Kisrawān and the Matn districts near the capital. In 1736 the Council of Luwayza mentioned eight Maronite dioceses among which the Beirut diocese included the Matn, the Jurd, and the Gharb up to Jisr al-Qādī near Dāmūr. Around 1748, the emir Yūssif Murād Abillamā authorized the general abbot of the Antonine Order to build a monastery in old Beirut and Bp. Mikhāʾil Fādil built the small cathedral church of Saint Georges in 1753, which was renovated, destroyed, and rebuilt many times but still stands today in the center of Beirut. The Maronite see of Beirut was built by Bp. Tubiyā ʿAwn (1844–71) near the cathedral, and his successor <ref type="cr">Yūsuf al-Dibs</ref> (1872–1907) transferred it near al-Ḥikma School, where it still is today. The Lebanese civil war (1975–90) greatly affected the Maronite diocese of Beirut, which numbered 140 churches before 1975 but lost 62 during the war as a result of the evacuation of Christians from 60 villages.</p>
<p>As for the Syr. Orth., a new diocese was created in the 19th cent., when refugees from Diyarbakır, <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> began to arrive in Lebanon, followed in the 20th cent. by those coming from Adana, Tarsus, and <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. Beirut also became an important center for the Syr. Cath. Church, which transferred its patriarchal residence from Mardin to Beirut under Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref> (1898–1929) and had its main seminary in <ref type="cr">Sharfeh</ref>. In the second half of the 20th cent. Beirut also became an episocopal see for the Chald. Church (with <ref type="cr">Raphael Bidawid</ref> as its most notable incumbent, between 1966 and 1989) as well as for the Ch. of E.</p>

Prior to his consecration as bp., Benjamin was monk in the Monastery of Mor Yaʿqub (most likely in Kaysum). Later in his life he was found teaching at the monasteries of Eusebona (833/4) and Tell ʿAda (836/7, when in his capacity of <i>Rabban d-dogma</i>, ‘professor of dogma’, he was there for a period of retreat: <i>kawšo d-tawtobutho</i>). Benjamin’s work is known to us in the commentaries written down by his disciples, who mention him in their colophons. One of them was Daniel (see ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,725; Wright, <i>Catalogue … British Museum</i>, vol. 2, 442). An anonymous commentary on the first volume of Gregory is said to have been written ‘according to the tradition’ (<i>mašlmonutho</i>) of Mar Benjamin (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 17,197; Wright, <i>Catalogue … British Museum</i>, vol. 2, 441a).</p>
<p>While the W.-Syr. information on Benjamin seems to be limited to his work on Gregory of Nazianzus (with the exception of a quotation by <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>, mentioned by Barsoum), <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref> knows a certain Benjamin, <i>dayroyo</i> or <i>iḥidoyo</i>, to whom on two occasions he specifically attributes a commentary on Dionysius (ed.

(This Benjamin is clearly to be distinguished from the allegedly 4th-cent. monk of that name; see Fiey, <i>Saints syriaques</i>, 56.)</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>This famous monastery was founded in 595/6 by Yaʿqub, a monk of the ‘Great Monastery’ of <ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref> (on the mountain of Izla), who originated from Lashom in <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>. Along with others Yaʿqub had been banished from the Great Monastery by <ref type="cr">Babai</ref>for countenancing what Babai regarded as monastic laxity. The monastery that Yaʿqub founded was evidently near the village of Kherpa, to the northwest of ʿAqra (thus Fiey, against Budge); it must have been in or near an earlier inhabited site named Beth ʿAbe since <i>Bethaba</i>is mentioned in Ptolemy’s ‘Geography’ (VI.1.4). The history of the monastery up to 832 is exceptionally well documented thanks to the account of its first 20 abbots by <ref type="cr">Toma of Marga</ref>, himself originally a monk of Beth ʿAbe. The monastery was especially flourishing in the mid 7th cent. when the future Patr. <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref>endowed it with land and built it a larger church, the monastic community having grown from 80 to 300. Toma relates that the patr. also left to the monastery ‘a golden Gospel’ (perhaps a Gospel lectionary with some rubrics in gold, surviving examples of which are known from the 13th cent.). One of the most famous monks of the monastery was the compiler of the ‘Paradise of the Fathers’, <ref type="cr">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>, who also assisted Ishoʿyahb III in his liturgical reforms. Many interesting details of the history and life of the monastery are provided by Toma (summarized by Budge, xli–xcvii). After 832 the history of the monastery is very little known, though a number of 13th-cent. mss. which were written there survive (Fiey, 247; a high quality one is a Gospel Lectionary of 1218, now Chester Beatty [Dublin], ms.4; Hatch,<i> Album of Dated Syriac Mss</i>., plate CLXXI). The monastery may possibly have lasted until the 16th cent.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Beth Aramaye 
</LemmaTitle><p>Ecclesiastical province of the Ch. of E., situated in Central Iraq. It had the patriarchal see of <ref type="cr">Kokhe</ref>, or <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, as its administrative and spiritual center. Its name points to a significant presence of <ref type="cr">Arameans</ref> or speakers of <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> in the region. The Persian name Asuristan (or Asorestan), which is preserved in some Arabic sources as well as in Armenian, may be a translation of the Aramaic name. In a letter of <ref type="cr">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref>, dated 484, it is reported that there was a ‘<i>marzbān</i> (i.e. governor) of Beth Aramaye’ (Chabot, 527.3; FT 533), who must have been a Sasanian official (Christensen, 136–40).</p>
<p>In the Synod of 410 (see <ref type="cr">Isḥaq</ref>) only one bp. is mentioned under the jurisdiction of the bp. of Seleucia-Ctesiphon (later: Catholicos), namely the bp. of Kashkar, who is the bp. of Seleucia-Ctesiphon’s right hand and assistant as well as the caretaker of his see after his death (Canon 21: Chabot, 33.15; FT 272). But four more dioceses of Beth Aramaye are known for the early 5th cent.: Zabe, <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref>, Dayra d-Qunni, and Dasqarta d-Malka (Fiey 1968, 148; map facing p. 152), while slightly later sources provide several additional names. Fiey (1968, 151–261) distinguishes between the ‘Persian’ and the ‘Arab’ dioceses. The ‘Persian’ dioceses, tracing their origin back to the Sasanian period, include: 1. Kashkar-Wāsiṭ; 2. Dayra d-Qunni (said to be the earliest monastery in Beth Aramaye), Beth Daraye, and Beth Kusaye; 3. Zabe (al-Zawābi, i.e. the region between Seleucia and Kashkar), al-Nuʿmāniyya, and Dayr Ḥazqiel); 4. Dasqarta d-Malka (ca. 88 km. northeast of <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>); 5. Ḥirta, ʿĀqūlā, and <ref type="cr">Nagran</ref> (named after Nagran in S. Arabia); 6.  Peruz Shapur, later known as <ref type="cr">al-Anbār</ref>. The ‘Arab’ dioceses emerged under Abbasid rule. They include: 1.  al-Qaṣr, between Baghdad and al-Kūfa; 2. Niffar (ancient Nippur) and al-Nīl; 3. ʿAbdāsi and Nahrgūr, both in the southeast of Iraq; 4. al-Rādhān, al-Baradān, and Beth Dārūn (of uncertain location, not far from Baghdad). In the later Islamic period, dioceses of Beth Aramaye were repeatedly amalgamated. By the 14th cent., Syr. Christianity had largely disappeared from Central Iraq. It was the north of Iraq that gradually became the center of the Ch. of E. (Wilmshurst, <i>Ecclesiastical Organisation</i>, 344). The name ‘Beth Aramaye’ lost its relevance.    </p>
<p>While both Persian and Arabic must have existed in the region from an early period onwards, in Syriac sources the inhabitants of Beth Aramaye were called <i>Ārāmāye</i> ‘Arameans’ (most often to be distinguished from <i>Armāye</i>  ‘pagans’), sing. <i>Ārāmāyā</i>, i.e. ‘from Beth Aramaye’ (this usage thus coexisted with a different and broader use of the term for the Aramaic language and ethnicity in general). <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>, in his Lexicon, quotes some peculiar forms of the Aramaic language of Beth Aramaye, which he, therefore, did not see as identical to Classical Syriac. Fiey (1990) has pointed out that in the Islamic period much of the content of the term ‘Beth Aramaye’ was transferred to the Arabic name ‘Nabaṭ’ (even though the ‘Nabaṭ’ of Central Iraq were distinguished from different groups of ‘Nabaṭ’, esp. in Arabia and Syria; see also Nöldeke). The Arabic term <i>nabṭī</i> also carried some of the connotations of ‘Aramean’ and ‘Aramaic’ and even was occasionally used, both by Christians and Muslims, as a substitute for ‘Aramaic’. This occurs, e.g., in <ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref>’s ‘Paradise of Christianity’ (commenting on the first language of the world) and in a related passage in Ibn al-Nadīm’s <i>Fihrist</i> (Fiey 1990, 83–84; cf. K. Samir, ‘Théodore de Mopsueste dans le «Fihrist» d’Ibn an-Nadīm’, <i>LM</i> 90 [1977], 355–63). <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, in his <i>Mukhtaṣar</i>, is aware that the Aramaic language (<i>nabṭiyya</i>) of Central Iraq is different from the Syriac of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> and <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref> as well as from ‘Palestinian’ Aramaic (quoted in Fiey 1990, 86), but it is not clear whether he speaks about the situation of his own day or rather reflects notions of a much earlier period.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical province extending from Beth Zabdai northward, <ref type="cr">Balad</ref> southward, and <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> westward, the latter being its capital city. The trade route linking southern Mesopotamia with Syria and Egypt passed though this region from at least the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC, with Nisibis (Akkadian <i>Naṣībīna</i>) serving as a caravan center. The region corresponds more or less to the Jazīra (lit. ‘island’) of the Arabic sources, enclosed by the Tigris and Euphrates. Arabs are attested in this region from Assyrian times, and it was the home of the Tanukhites during the Christian era, hence its Syriac name ‘Land of the Arabs’. The Synod of 410 established Beth ʿArbaye as an E.-Syr. metropolitan province, the second after the province of Elam. The province included such cities and regions as Beth Zabdai, Qardu, and Balad, and by the 13th cent. it also included Armenia. The long list of E.-Syr. metropolitans in Nisibis gives evidence of uninterrupted succession, beginning probably with <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> and ending with another Yaʿqub in the year 1616. Beth ʿArbaye was also the home of a large Syr. Orth. community as early as the mid 6th cent., the time of <ref type="cr">Aḥudemmeh</ref> ‘Bishop of Beth ʿArbaye’ who became Metropolitan of the East in 559. When Metropolitan <ref type="cr">Marutha</ref> settled in <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref> in 629, the titles ‘of Beth ʿArbaye’ and ‘of Tagrit’ became interchangeable.</p>

<p>An ecclesiastical province confined between the Lower Zab northward, the Tigris westward, the Diyālā river southward, and the mountains of Ḥimrīn eastward. Its capital city is Karka ‘The Fortress’ or Karkh Slokh ‘Fortress of Seleucus’, modern Kirkuk. Its earlier center was Shahr-gird ‘City of the King’, a town located to the east of Kirkuk, though its exact location is not known. Beth Garmai may have been a Metropolitan see from the 3rd cent., if not earlier, having its center possibly at Shahr-gird, but in any case it was made so at the synod of 410. The earliest three bishops of Karka lived during the reign of Shapur II (309–79) and were martyred by him, and the last bp. served the province at least until 1318. After the first quarter of the 9th cent., the see was transferred from Karka to Shahrzur to the east of Beth Garmai, and then to Daquqa. Shahr­zur, an E.-Syr. bishopric seat as early as the 6th cent., was also the seat of a Syr. Orth. bp. under the jurisdiction of <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref> during the 7th and 8th cent. During the early 19th cent., a Chald. diocese was created in Kirkuk that exists to this day.</p>

<Author>A. Harrak</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Beth Lapaṭ</head><ab type="infobox"/>Gondeshapur, Jundi-Shapur
<p>Chief city of Beth Huzaye/Khuzistan, whose metropolitan bishopric ranked second after that of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>. Its ruins are near Sahabad, between Tustar and Dezful. Beth Lapaṭ was (re-)founded soon after the sack of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> (256) by Shapur I (241–272) with the name Gondeshapur (‘Shapur’s Antioch is better’), and was settled with prisoners from the Roman Empire. Among the captives was the bp. of Antioch, Demetrianus, and the episcopal line of Beth Lapaṭ will have commenced with him. It was at Beth Lapaṭ, one of the Shah’s summer residences, that <ref type="cr">Mani</ref> was put to death in 276/7. Beth Lapaṭ produced several martyrs during the persecutions of Shapur II, one being bp. Gadyab (mentioned by Sozomen, Ecclesiastical History, II.13), who, according to the early Life of Miles, consecrated Miles as bp. of Susa. At the Synod of Seleucia-Ctesiphon of 410 the metropolitan of Beth Lapaṭ features first in the list of metropolitan sees, and later <ref type="cr">Mar Aba</ref> specifies that he should preside over the election of a new Cath. (<i>Synodicon Orientale</i>, 543–44, tr. 554). In 410 its suffragan dioceses are listed as Karka d-Ledan, Hormizd Ardashir (Ahwaz), Shushterin (Tustar), and Shush (Susa); later additions were Ram Hormizd and Mihraqan Qadaq (linked with Ispahan in the synod of 497). It was at Beth Lapaṭ that bp. <ref type="cr">Barsawma of Nisibis</ref> convened his rebel synod in 484, whose acts were later annulled in 486. A theological school is known to have existed in Beth Lapaṭ in the late Sasanian Empire; whether or not it also had a medical school attached (as was the case at <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> at the end of the 6th cent.) is disputed (see Reinink). Such a school is definitely attested for the early Abbasid period by <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>’s Letter 13 (ed. Braun, CSCO 74, 108), and is implied by al-Manṣūr’s summoning of Gewargis, of the Bokhtishoʿ family (see <ref type="cr">Gabriel bar Bokhtisho</ref>ʿ) in Beth Lapaṭ, to be his physician in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>. By this time the metropolitan see was known as that of Elam. Apart from the names of a number of its bishops little is known of the later history of Beth Lapaṭ, and the see evidently came to an end some time in the 14th cent. (For a synoptic list of bishops of Beth Lapaṭ and its dioceses, see C. and F. Jullien, in <i>Dictionnaire de la Bible, Supplément</i>, fasc. 74 [2003], cols. 617–18).</p>

<p>An E.-Syr. bishopric seat the heartland of which was the region extending from the small Khabur river to the Tigris, including the area of modern Zakho and part of Dehok. Administratively, it was under the jurisdiction of the Metr. see of <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref> established at the synod of 410.

After the expansion of the Syr. Orth. community in the plain of Nineveh during the same century and the creation of their own Beth Nuhadra, the E.-Syr. diocese was restricted to the northern and the eastern regions of its former domain. The E.-Syr. bishops are attested from the early 5th to the middle of the 13th cent. The bishops of the Syr. Orth. Beth Nuhadra are known between the end of the 6th cent. and the 8th cent., residing first in the Monastery of Nardos (modern Dayr Jundī) and then in Maʿalta. In modern times, the reduced Beth Nuhadra is the domain of the Chald. bp. who resides in Zakho.</p>

<label type="subsection"><LemmaTitle>Beth Qaṭraye</LemmaTitle></label>
<p>The region known in Syriac as Beth Qaṭraye includes not only the peninsula of Qaṭar, but also its hinterland Yamāma, and the entire coast of northeast Arabia as far as the peninsula of Musandam, in present-day Oman, along with the islands. Christianity must have reached Beth Qaṭraye no later than the 4th cent. Eliya, Bp. of Mashmahig, was present at the first Synod of the Ch. of E., in <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> (410), while another bp. of Mashmahig was deposed and excommunicated at the same synod. From the 6th cent. onwards, in addition to Mashmahig, there were bishops in Dayrin, Mazun, Hagar, and Ḥaṭṭa. Initially they were under the control of the metropolitan of Rev Ardashir, in <ref type="cr">Fars</ref>, until Beth Qaṭraye obtained its own metropolitan, whose existence is attested only in 676.</p>
<p>Most of the information on Beth Qaṭraye pertains to the early Islamic period. Among the correspondence of Cath. <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> (649–59), five letters deal with troubles in Beth Qaṭraye. The background is the rebellion of metropolitan <ref type="cr">Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir</ref> against the Cath.; this triggered an uprising among the bishops of Beth Qaṭraye, who likewise turned their back on the Cath. Among Ishoʿyahb III’s preserved letters one is addressed to the bishops, two to the Christians in general, and two to the monks. Although the details are not known, the rebellion had come to an end in 676, when Cath. <ref type="cr">Gewargis</ref> (659–80) went to Beth Qaṭraye for a local synod. Very little is known of the subsequent history of Beth Qaṭraye; Christianity may have disappeared from the region after the 9th cent.</p>
<p>In the 6th and 7th cent., Christian Beth Qaṭraye produced a number of important Syriac authors. Most well known among them is the ascetic and mystical author <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>, who was born and lived for some time in Beth Qaṭraye, before Cath. Gewargis took him to <ref type="cr">Beth Aramaye</ref>. After a short-lived episcopate in <ref type="cr">Nineveh</ref>, he withdrew to eremitic life in Beth Huzaye. Another very important ascetic author from this region is <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref>. Among the various authors designated as <ref type="cr">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref> in the sources, there is a biblical interpreter, who was a teacher in Seleucia-Ctesiphon in the mid-7th cent., and a commentator on the <ref type="cr">liturgy</ref>, who lived in the first half of the 7th cent. The latter ­Gabriel’s work on the liturgy probably was the main source for the short commentary attributed to <ref type="cr">Abraham Qaṭraya bar Lipeh</ref>. Another biblical interpreter frequently quoted in later sources is <ref type="cr">Aḥob Qaṭraya</ref>.</p>
<p>While Christians in Beth Qaṭraye used Syriac as their literary and liturgical language, Persian and Arabic must have existed in the region as well. This linguistic complexity is reflected in a few dozen glosses, explicit­ly identified as being in the ‘language of Beth Qaṭraye’ (in some cases the adverb <i>qaṭrāʾit</i> is used) and preserved in later works, esp. in biblical commentaries and in the Lexicon of <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>. Some of these glosses are attributed to the biblical interpreters Gabriel and Aḥob Qaṭraya. While some can be identified as Aramaic, others point to a Persian (Pahlavi or proto-Neo-Persian) or to an Arabic origin. Users of this language must have been among the readers and writers of Syriac texts in Bet Qaṭraye.</p>
<p>Christians from Beth Qaṭraye also served as translators. The Persian translator for the (undoubtedly Arabic speaking) Laḥmid king al-Nuʿmān III (579–601) is said to have been a Christian from Beth Qaṭraye. A monk from Beth Qaṭraye is credited with the translation from Persian into Syriac of the Law Book of Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Beulay, Robert</head><ab type="infobox"/> (1927–2007)
<p>Carmelite priest, scholar of the Ch. of E. and of E.-Syr. mysticism. He was born in Paris, entered the Carmelite order in 1945, was ordained in 1953, and in 1958 went to <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> to the Carmelite mission, which had been founded there in the 17th cent. He was professor of dogmatic theology at the Chaldean Seminary in Baghdad from 1963. At Babel College, which was founded in 1991, he taught spirituality, general and oriental, ontology and philosophy of nature. In 1997 he began teaching Syriac theology as well.</p>
<p>Initially in Paris under the influence of L. Massignon, his teacher, he studied Islamic mysticism, but the Carmelite order preferred that he focus on the mystical writings of the Syriac church. He studied Near Eastern languages for three years, graduated from the École Pratique des Hautes Études in 1971, and presented his doctoral thesis at the Sorbonne in 1974. Both parts of his thesis were published: <i>La lumière sans forme</i> in 1987 and <i>L’enseignement spirituel de Jean de Dalyatha</i> in 1990. <ref type="cr">Antoine</ref> <ref type="cr">Guillaumont</ref> was his teacher at the École Pratique and attested to the contribution his studies made to scholarship. At that time, <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref> was largely unedited so that in order to write his thesis Beulay had to assemble copies of mss., including the Arabic version — all of this in Baghdad far from western libraries. In addition to Yoḥannan of Dalyatha, he did significant research on <ref type="cr">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref> as well, including a translation of Yawsep’s ‘Treatise on the nature of the divine essence’, preserved in a 13th-cent. ms. from <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref> (Notre-Dame des Semences 237/Dawra 680). His commitment to scholarship never waned nor was compromised during his many years in Baghdad. He contributed publications and actively participated in seminars and international symposia on Syriac studies.</p>
<p>He never lost sight of the connection between Syriac writers and their church. Also he sought to make this tradition available to the Iraqi people among whose ancestors it had developed. He did this while teaching at Babel College. Several articles from this period may be found in <i>Patrimoine Syriaque</i> (1996, 2001, 2005). Through his teaching and his ministry as priest, he worked to sustain the faith of countless students during tragic years in Iraq. Even after he returned permanently to France in 2004, for health reasons, his students exiled all over the world kept in touch. He died in 2007 in Normandy and was buried in Lisieux.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Ever since the 2nd cent., when the first Syriac Bible translations were produced, the Bible has played an important role in Syriac Christianity. It is not just that many terms specific to the spirituality of the Syriac Churches have their origin in these versions, they have also contributed to the spread of the dialect of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> as a standard language for a large group of Christians. For today’s Syriac churches, they remain important, either in the original tongue or in translations into English or Malayalam. They have, however, also attracted the interest of scholars outside the Syriac communities. This has to do with the fact that the Syriac versions are very ancient and have also come down to us in relatively ancient mss. (see <ref type="cr">Bible, OT manuscripts</ref> and <ref type="cr">Bible, NT manuscripts</ref>). They give us a picture of the original Hebrew and Greek texts at the moment the translations into Syriac were made.</p>
<label type="subsection">Syriac Translations of the Old Testament</label>
<p>The first Syriac version of the OT must have been made in the second half of the 2nd cent. At least since the 9th cent., it has been known under the name <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>. In contrast to other early Christian translations of the OT, it was based on the Hebrew Bible rather than the Greek Septuagint. This fact gives it a special place among the witnesses to the Hebrew Bible, the pronunciation of which was codified only from the 7th cent. onwards.</p>
<p>When Greek OT commentaries started to be translated into Syriac in the 4th and 5th cent., their translators used the Peshitta for the biblical quotations. Soon they found out that this text did not always agree with the Greek text of the commentaries, which sometimes made it hard to understand what the exegete in question was referring to. For this reason, E.-Syr. translators started to add <i>ad hoc</i> translations of the biblical text as quoted in the Greek commentary to the verse taken from the Peshitta. They would mark these <i>ad hoc</i> renderings specifically as ‘the Greek’. At least since <ref type="cr">Mushe of Aggel</ref> early in the 6th cent., W.-Syr. translators started simply to render the biblical text of the commentary, no longer referring to the Peshitta. Such <i>ad hoc</i> renderings have often been mistaken for quotations from a version made by the chorepiscopus <ref type="cr">Polykarpos</ref> in 507/508, which may have extended to the OT: there is evidence at least for Genesis, Exodus, and Isaiah (the so-called Syro-Lucianic fragments edited by Ceriani may belong to it). This version is indicative of the high status accorded to the Greek language and Greek Bible by the person who commissioned it, <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>. Philoxenos was afraid that loose renderings might give rise to Dyophysite interpretations.</p>
<p>A century later, in 613–17, the status of Greek among the W. Syr. was such that <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Tella</ref> felt the need to make an extremely literal ‘mirror translation’ of the Septuagint, known as the <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref>. Here the unit of translation is the single word or even part of it. The name refers to Origen’s Hexapla, as it claims to be based on a version of the fifth, Septuagint, column supplied with text-critical signs indicating where material has been added or omitted, as well as notes referring to the three revisions: Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion.</p>
<p>At a time when the Greek language was losing its status, <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> produced his revision of the Peshitta with the help of one or more Greek mss.; there is no evidence that he used the Syro-Hexapla, as has been assumed by some. It may be seen as a last effort to make the Greek Bible acceptable to Syriac readers. Yaʿqub’s version was a compromise between the two positions defended in Syriac Christianity: the position of Philoxenos, who would have liked to replace the Peshitta with a very literal rendering of the Septuagint, and that of <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Emesa</ref>, who thought that the Peshitta was reliable because the Syriac language was related to the Hebrew. In addition, Yaʿqub wanted to clarify the text to his readers.</p>
<p>Syriac exegetes of the OT (see <ref type="cr">Exegesis, Old Testament</ref>) were well aware of the existence of alternative readings. In his ‘Commentary on Genesis’ <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> already quotes two different renderings, without mentioning the source (ad Gen. 49:10 and 49:23). These alternative readings happen to agree with Targum Onqelos. In the 5th cent., translations of Antiochene commentaries of such authors as Eusebius of Emesa, <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, and <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref> showed to Syriac exegetes the practice of quoting ‘the Hebrew’ as well as the revisions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. Eusebius and Theodore were read by the E. Syr.; John Chrysostom was studied by W. Syr. as well. The latter of course also became familiar with this practice through the notes in the margins of the Syro-Hexapla.</p>
<p>Even though the E. Syr. adopted Theodore of Mopsuestia, who was rather negative about the authority of the Peshitta, as their exegete <i>par excellence</i>, and even though the W.-Syr. tradition was influenced by the opinion of Philoxenos that favored the Greek text, the Peshitta remained the standard version for all: ‘it is in the hands of the Syrians everywhere’ as <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> had to conclude in the introduction to his scholia on the Bible, the <i>Awṣar roze</i>. Only occasionally passages from the Syro-Hexapla found their way into W.-Syr. lectionary mss. used in the liturgy.</p>
<p>Problems of orthography and pronunciation in the Syriac language were dealt with in the mss. of the ‘<ref type="cr">Masora</ref>’, which flourished in the two centuries after Yaʿqub of Edessa. The W.-Syr. ‘Masora’, which is associated with the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Qarqaphto</ref><LemmaTitle>, gives samples from the OT and</LemmaTitle>NT (Peshitta and <ref type="cr">Ḥarqlean</ref>), as well as patristic sources, in order to illustrate the correct use of the language in writing and reading; the E.-Syr. ‘Masora’ is exclusively biblical.</p>
<label type="subsection">Syriac Translations of the New Testament</label>
<p>The Syriac versions of the NT are all based on Greek texts. Though they are the oldest translations in a Semitic language, there is no reason to assume any direct connection between these Syriac (i.e. Eastern Aramaic) texts and Jesus’ original words in Western Aramaic. Some unusual forms of vocabulary and grammar found in the so-called Old Syriac translation can easily be explained as archaic forms of the Syriac language. They should not necessarily be seen as Western, Palestinian Aramaic forms. For biblical scholars, the importance of the Syriac versions lies primarily in the fact that they are essential witnesses to the text history of the Greek NT, as they contain demonstrably archaic variants. Many of these must have originated in Greek mss. that are no longer available to us, but even where this is not the case, they may still give us insight into the theology and mindset of early Christians.</p>
<p>The oldest Syriac version of the Gospels is the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref> (also <i>ewangeliyon da-mḥallṭe</i> ‘Gospel of the mixed’), written in the early 170s. This version, probably produced by <ref type="cr">Tatian</ref> and probably in Syriac rather than Greek, was quoted by such authors as <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref> and Ephrem; the latter even composed a commentary on it. It remained in liturgical use until at least the early 5th cent., when it lost its canonical status and was replaced by the four separate Gospels (<i>ewangeliyon da-mparrše</i> ‘Gospel of the separated’). Although it was suppressed by force to such an extent that we are left only with quotations, there are reasons to believe that it influenced all later versions. Quotations in Ephrem indicate that the Acts and Epistles had also been translated by the 4th cent. It has been tentatively suggested that these translations, or forerunners of them, might also go back to Tatian’s efforts (Petersen).</p>
<p>The Vetus Syra or <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Version</ref> is the oldest version of the four separate Gospels. The two surviving mss., the Curetonianus and the Sinaiticus, both date back to the 5th cent., but they may be seen as two representatives of a translation probably made in the middle of the 3rd cent. The NT Peshitta is the result of a thorough revision of Old Syriac material, using slightly different Greek mss. The differences between the Old Syriac and the Peshitta can be explained on the basis of the different Greek texts used and the development in the ideas on translation technique: the Peshitta is more literal. In the time of <ref type="cr">Rabbula</ref> this version quickly gained currency as the standard version of the Syriac NT, replacing the Diatessaron and other early translations. The NT Peshitta also covers the Acts and Epistles, apart from 2 Peter, 2–3 John, and Jude; it also omitted Revelation.</p>
<p>As stated above, for theological reasons Philoxenos of Mabbug preferred a more precise rendering of the Greek, which Polykarpos made for him in 507/8. This Philoxenian Version was a revision of the Peshitta. There has been considerable confusion between this version and the Ḥarqlean <ref type="cr">Version, made in 615/16 by Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref>. On the basis of Philoxenos’s Gospel commentaries, Brock has demonstrated that the Philoxenian is lost, apart from Philoxenos’s own quotations and perhaps a 6th-cent. translation of the Minor Catholic Epistles and Revelation. The Ḥarqlean, which covers all 27 NT books, shares many characteristics with the Syro-Hexapla, which was made in the same place, the <ref type="cr">Enaton</ref> outside Alexandria, and at the same time: it is a revision of the Philoxenian with the aim of producing a mirror translation of the Greek. Tuma strove to achieve a formal equivalence between Greek and Syriac which extended sometimes even below word level.</p>
<label type="subsection">The Syriac Canon</label>
<p>Syriac biblical mss. usually contain no more than one book or a small group of books, for instance the Pentateuch, the ‘Book of the Women’ (Ruth, Susanna, Esther, and Judith), or the <i>Beth Mawtbe</i> ‘the Book of Sessions’ (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Proverbs, Qohelet, Ruth, Song of Songs, Bar Sira, and Job; especially in the E.-Syr. tradition). Differences between the very few early <i>pan­dects</i> containing the whole OT show that neither the Syriac canon of the OT nor the order of books had been defined in the first millenium. Though there are reasons to believe that Chronicles, Ezra-Nehemiah, Esther, Job, and Song of Songs did not form part of the canon in earlier centuries (Haelewyck), the books of the Hebrew Bible are all present in these <i>pandects</i>. The situation with regard to the so-called Apocrypha or Deuterocanonical works, on the other hand, still differs from <i>pandect</i> to <i>pandect</i>. The Milan ms. (7a1) even contains part of Flavius <ref type="cr">Josephus</ref>’s ‘Jewish War’. The order of books is often chronological, in which Job, identified with Jobab of Gen. 10:29, is placed directly after the Pentateuch.</p>
<p>With regard to the NT, the <ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref> states that members of the church are to read the Gospel, the Epistles of Paul, and the Book of Acts. During the first centuries, ‘the Gospel’ referred to the Diatessaron. As stated above, Ephrem already knew the four separate Gospels in the Old Syriac Version; he referred to them as ‘the Greek’. Only in the time of Rabbula the Peshitta with its four-Gospel canon replaced the Diatessaron. It contained a total of 22 books, as it did not include 2 Peter, 2–3 John, Jude, and Revelation (cf. also <ref type="cr">Apocalypses</ref>). This canon, also known from Antiochene authors, no longer included the additional (3rd) epistle to the Corinthians which is quoted in Ephrem’s Commentary on the Pauline Epistles (Armenian). It may also have ‘promoted’ 1 Peter and 1 John, which were known to Ephrem but probably not considered canonical by him. 2 Peter, 
2–3 John, Jude, and Revelation were translated for the first time in the 6th cent. (possibly as part of the version made by Polykarpos for Philoxenos) and are also present in the Ḥarqlean Version.</p>

<Author>R. B. ter Haar Romeny</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Bible, Old Testament manuscripts
</LemmaTitle><p>The oldest dated mss. are both of the 5th cent.: a palimpsest of Isaiah (5ph1 in the Leiden Peshitta edition; 459/60), and a Pentateuch (5b1; 463/4). Of the ca. 50 <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> mss. dating from before ca. 1000 (eleven of which are dated), two-thirds consist of single books, the remainder being groups of books (especially, the Pentateuch), with the exception of three entire Old Testaments (7a1, 8a1, and 9a1). Occasionally a biblical book is transmitted in the same ms. as non-biblical texts. Outside the Pentateuch there is no fixed order of books, even in the rare mss. with the entire OT; there the contents as well vary, especially as far as the so-called ‘deutero-canonical’ or ‘apocryphal’ books are concerned. In the 
E.-Syr. tradition a grouping of books known as <i>Beth Mawtbe</i> came into use, consisting of the historical books, less Chronicles, followed by Proverbs, Sirach, Qohelet, Ruth, Song, and Job (Psalms were usually copied separately). Another grouping is of ‘Books of the Women’ (Ruth, Esther, Susanna, Judith).</p>
<p>In the earliest mss. lections are sometimes indicated within the biblical text, but more frequently lections were added in the margins by later hands. About the 9th/10th  cent. the first lectionary mss. appear, with the readings in the sequence of the liturgical year. 
Illustrations are extremely rare; with the exception of a portrait of David in a Sinai ms. of Kings (7h10) these are confined to two <i>de luxe</i> productions with the entire OT (8a1, 12a1). Bilingual mss. are also very rare and almost all are Syriac with Arabic; an exceptional case is a pentaglot Psalter, Syriac with Arabic, Armenian, Coptic, and Ethiopic (Rome, Barberiniani Or. 2; 
14th cent.).</p>
<p>Of the versions other than the Peshitta, the most important ms. is the large <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref> in Milan, containing the prophetic and wisdom books (8th cent.). The first half of this ms., still extant in the 16th cent., has been subsequently lost, with the result that for several books no Syro-Hexapla ms. is available; Exodus, however, is preserved in a ms. dated 697. Occasionally the Syro-Hexapla features in a separate column alongside other versions: with Peshitta (Isaiah; 9k3); with Greek and Arabic (Psalms; ed. N. Pigulevskaya, <i>Palestinskii Sbornik</i> 1[63] [1954], 59–90); and in a polyglot Psalter (with Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic). Passages from the Syro-Hexapla were sometimes used in lectionary mss. Some books of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>’s revision survive in mss. copied only a decade or two after his death. That of Samuel has lections supplied (with a table indicating where to find them) in an early second hand.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Most of the important biblical mss. extant today derive from three ancient collections in the Near East: From <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān,</ref>from the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref> at Mount Sinai, and from <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> near <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>. A small part of the Nitrian collection (from Dayr al-Suryān) was acquired by the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana in the 18th cent., its larger part came to the British Museum (Library) during the 19th cent. The Sinaitic collection remained unmoved from the 6th cent. (the time of Emperor Justinian) until today, the mss. of Dayr al-Zaʿfarān moved to Mardin, <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>.</p>
<p>1. No Syriac copy of the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref> survived; <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>’s commentary is the only Syriac witness extant today (ms. Dublin, Chester Beatty Library 709; 5th/6th  cent., from Dayr al-Suryān).</p>
<p>2. Of the <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Version</ref> only two defective Gospel mss. survived: The 5th-cent. ‘Codex Curetonianus’ of the Nitrian coll. (now ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,451), edited for the first time by <ref type="cr">W. Cureton</ref> (1858) and again by <ref type="cr">F. C. Burkitt</ref> (1904); and the 4th/5th-cent. ‘Sinaitic Ms.’ (ms. Sinai Syr. 30; Hatch, <i>Album</i> plate xlvi), a palimpsest which is not entirely deciphered, discovered in 1892 by Agnes Smith Lewis and published by her in 1894/96 and 1910.</p>
<p>3. Most of the Syriac NT mss. in the large collections are <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> mss. Among the ca. 100 of the British Library, ca. 60 are from the first millennium, and ca. 30 of them are 5th/7th-cent. mss. Thanks to the Nitrian collection of the British Library, we have a good knowledge of the early Peshitta, which originates from the beginning of the 5th cent. Though many mss. have lost their colophon, a considerable part of them can be assigned to the 5th/6th cent. on palaeographical grounds.</p>
<p>Early Peshitta mss. of the whole NT (according to the Peshitta canon) are ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,470 (5th/6th, Wright, <i>Catalogue … British Museum</i>, vol. 1, no. lxiii), Brit. Libr. Add. 14,448 (700/01, no. lxiv), ms. Sinai Syr. 17 (9th) and 54 (8th), ms. Damascus, Syr. Orth. Patr. Libr. 12/1 (7th/8th?), and ms. Mingana Syr. 103 (‘about AD 790’, according to Mingana, but rather 8th/9th cent.).</p>
<p>The oldest dated Gospel mss. are from the 6th cent.: ms. Dayr al-Suryān 10 (510); ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,459 fol. 67–169 (between 528/538, colophon damaged; no. ci; Hatch, <i>Album,</i> plate xiii); ms. Vat. Syr. 12 (548, plate xx); ms. Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana Plut. I,56 (586, plate xxxiv). Undated, but of the 5th/
6th cent. are ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 296 fol. 1–38, Sinai Syr. 2, and nos. lxvi, lxvii, lxxiii, xc–xciv, xcvi, xcix, cx, cxiii in Wright, <i>Catalogue … British Museum</i>, vol. 1. Of special interest is Cod. Phillipps 1388 (5th/6th, Berlin). This Gospel codex is singled out by its archaic orthographical features; though doubtless a Peshitta codex, it preserved a considerable Old Syriac textual heritage.</p>
<p>The earliest Peshitta mss. of Acts and the Catholic Epistles are ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,473 (no. cxxv), Add. 17,120 (no. cxxvi), Add. 17,121 (no. cxxvii), Add. 14,472 (no. cxxviii, datable before 624), Add. 18,812 (no. cxxix), all of the 6th/7th cent.</p>
<p>The oldest Peshitta mss. of the Pauline Letters are ms. 3 of the Public Library in St. Petersburg (5th/6th), ms. Sinai Syr. 3 and 5 (both 5th/6th), Cod. Syr. 8 of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich (6th/7th), and ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,476 (no. cxxxiii), Add. 14,480 (no. cxxxiv), both from the 5th/6th cent.; Add. 14,479 (dated 533/34, no. cxxxv), Add. 14,475 (no. cxxxvi), Add. 17,122 (no. cxxxvii) from the 6th cent.; Add. 14,477 (no. cxxxviii) and 14,481 (no. cxxxix) from the 7th cent.</p>
<p>4. No early copy of the Philoxenian version (507/08) survived. Remnants (partly in Maronite tradition) ascribed to this version preserve the extra-Peshitta texts (2 Pet., 2–3 John, Jude, and Rev.) and were published by J. Gwynn 1897 (Rev., based on ms. Crawford Syr. 2, 12th/13th, now John Rylands Library, Manchester) and 1909. Among Gwynn’s 20 mss. the oldest dated (823) is ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,623 (Wright, <i>Catalogue … British Museum</i>, vol. 2, no. dcclxxxi; Hatch, <i>Album,</i> plate xcviii). Today at least ten more are availiable, all of the second millennium: ms. Damascus Patr. 1/2; ms. Mingana Syr. 480; ms. Bibl. Ambrosiana B20.2 inf. (Milan); ms. Vat. Syr. 461; 475, 486, ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 429, ms. Berlin, Diez A. quart. 105, ms. Mardin Orth. 36/2.</p>
<p>5a. The mss. of the <ref type="cr">Ḥarqlean version</ref> (615/16) usually catch the eye by the numerous Greek and Syriac words quoted in the margins and by the critical signs (<i>asterisks</i> and <i>obeloi</i>) inserted into the text. But this typical feature of the Ḥarqlean version was already reduced by revisional development during the first millennium, and then completely omitted in mss. mainly of the second millennium. Nevertheless, the oldest dated Ḥarqlean ms. (Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana Plut. I,40, dated to 756) 
already omits all marginal annotations (although there are Greek notes), and one of the latest (ms. Oxford, New College 333, 12th/13th cent., the whole NT, breaking off Heb 11,27) belongs to those with the fullest margin. The <i>editio princeps</i> (1778–1803) of J. White is based on this late ms., which in fact accumulates the marginalia of two different stages of development. The dominance of White’s Gospel text was recently balanced by ms. Vat. Syr. 268, published by G. A. Kiraz in 1996 (as the Ḥarqlean line in Kiraz, <i>CESG</i>). This ms. from the Nitrian coll. in the British Library represents the most original text and margin of the Ḥarqlean Gospels by its unrevised non- and pre-Byzantine readings. Though the date ‘1170 A. Gr.’ (858/59) on the almost illegible fol. 172v is not the original date of the ms. as Hatch, <i>Album,</i> plate lxix declares (for details see Kiraz, <i>CESG</i>, vol. 1, xlvi–
xlvii), it is assigned to the 8th/9th cent. on palaeographical grounds. Important Gospel mss. with marginal notes of the first revisional stage are ms. Vat. Syr. 267 (8th), ms. Harvard Syr. 16 (8th/9th), ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 7163, and ms. Mingana Syr. 124 (both 9th/10th), ms. Syr. Orth. Patr. Libr. 12/8 (1055, from Dayr al-Zaʿfarān), ms. Syr. Orth. Patr. Libr. 12/9 (998/999; formerly ms. Jerusalem, St. Mark 25, Hatch, <i>Album,</i> plate lxxvi), ms. Chester Beatty Syr. 3 (1177, copied from a model of 841; Hatch, <i>Album,</i> plate lxxxiii). Mss. of the first millennium without marginal notes are ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,469 (935/36), and ms. Cambridge, Univ. Library or. 227 (1061/62, with <i>asterisks</i> and <i>obeloi</i>).</p>
<p>5b. The second revisional stage (traceable in the Gospels only) is ascribed to <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> according to a subscription in ms. Oxford, New Coll. 334 (12th/13th) and ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,124 (1233/34), both with marginal notes (Wright, <i>Catalogue  … British Museum</i>, vol. 1, 42). Connected with this unhomogeneous stage are some 15 late mss. of which ms. Baghdad, Chaldean Monastery no. 25 (12th/13th; Vosté no. 16), ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 53 (12th), and ms. Oxford, New Coll. 333 (12th/13th) are furnished with marginal and asterisked annotations.</p>
<p>5c. Only two mss. of Acts (of unkown revisional stage) are availiable today: ms. Oxford, New Coll. 333 (12th/13th) and ms. Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Add. 1700 (1169/70, Hatch, <i>Album</i> plate cxxix). Both mss. provide all books of the NT (without Rev.), only the first offers the Ḥarqlean marginal annotations. Besides these two mss. ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,474 (9th) includes the Catholic Epistles (with annotations; 1 Pet. Peshitta). The Cambridge ms. also includes the two letters to the Corinthians ascribed to <ref type="cr">Clement of Rome</ref>. Ms. Jerusalem, St. Mark 37 (9th, with annotations) is the only early witness for St. Paul’s Letters. Revelation is represented by ca. ten late mss., ms. Mardin Orth. 36/2 (13th; ed. by A. Vööbus [as 35/2] in CSCO 400 with an informative introduction) is furnished with a subscription, and marginal/asterisked readings. The book of Rev. in the Ḥarqlean version is still waiting for a critical edition; I. R. Beacham has, however, provided a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>A special category of biblical mss. are the mss. of the so-called <ref type="cr">Masora</ref>.</p>
<p>6. Dated and datable mss. of the Peshitta (first millennium): Complete NT: ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,448 (700/01), Add. 7157 (767/68); ms. Pierpont Morgan Library 236 (749/750), ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 342 (894); Gospels: ms. Dayr al-Suryān 10 (510); ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,459, fol. 67–169 (between 528/38), ms. Vat. Syr. 12 (548), ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,464 (before 583), ms. Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana Plut. I,56 (586; the <ref type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref>), ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,460 (599/600), Add. 14,471 (614/15); Acts/Cath. Epistles: ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,472 (before 624); Pauline Epistles: ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,478 (ante 621/22), Add. 14,479 (533/34).</p>
<p>For two reasons Peshitta mss. offer good conditions for qualified dating. Firstly, the number of dated and datable mss. is considerable. There are at least 10 such mss. of the 5th–8th cent.; their palaeographical features and codicological data offer help for an approximate dating of undated codices. Secondly, the large number of Peshitta mss. allows for tracing the development of variant readings. Considering the place of the dated mss. within this development, it is mainly possible to assign an approximate date to undated mss. by knowledge of their variants; e.g. misdated mss. corrected this way are ms. Sinai Syr. 3 (5th/6th, not 7th cent.), ms. Vat. Syr. 266 (10th/11th cent., not 7th); ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,478 (5th/6th cent., not 621/22, which is the date of the owner’s note).</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The earliest attempts at collecting and systematizing knowledge about Syriac Christian authors and their writings can be traced back to the Syrians themselves. One might refer to the ‘Catalogue of Books’ by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>(d. 1318), a poem listing all Syriac authors known to him and their writings. An annotated edition of the ‘Catalogue’ was an important component in <ref type="cr">J. S. Assemani</ref>’s <i>Bibliotheca Orientalis</i> (1719–28), which marks the transition between pre-modern and modern scholarship. Ample references to 19th- and early 20th-cent. publications on Syriac authors can be found in <ref type="cr">A. Baumstark</ref>’s <i>Geschichte der syrischen Literatur</i> (1921), while the first six decades of the 20th cent. are covered in I. Ortiz de Urbina’s <i>Patrologia Syriaca</i> (2nd ed. 1965). Both of these works provide a narrative, albeit fragmented, history of Syriac literature and are not primarily designed as bibliographical tools. C. Moss’ <i>Catalogue of Syriac books and related literature in the British Museum</i> (1962), on the other hand, is a pure bibliography. Though limited to the holdings of one institution, it provides a very useful key to Syriac scholarship. Ancient and modern authors are listed indiscriminately in alphabetical order, and some broader topics (e.g., ‘Bible’, ‘Liturgies’) are included as well. This approach necessitated a great number of cross-references and, in addition, the user has to go back and forth 
between the main part (col. 2–1174) and the ‘Addenda’ (col. 1–206). Where Moss left off (1960), S. P. Brock picked up with a series of installments of his ‘Syriac studies: a classified bibliography’, published in <i>Parole de l’Orient</i>. Organized around the names of ancient authors and themes, each installment originally covered a ten year span, but since 1980 the bibliography has appeared in five year increments. Four installments, altogether covering the years 1960–1990, were integrated into one book form publication (Brock 1996). Three more installments have since appeared: 1991–95 in <i>ParOr</i> 23 (1998), 1996–2000 in <i>ParOr</i> 29 (2004), and 2001–2005 in <i>ParOr</i> 33 (2008). Brock also publishes an annual list of new books on Syriac topics in the winter issue of <i>Hugoye</i>, but in contrast to the <i>ParOr</i> bibliographies, this does not include papers in journals or individual chapters in books. Selective bibliographies, aimed at beginning scholars, can be found in Brock’s <i>Introduction to Syriac studies</i> (most recently 2006) and in M. Albert’s ‘Langue et littérature syriaque’ (1993).</p>
<p>In addition to the general bibliographies mentioned so far (of either the exhaustive or the selective type), there exist a number of specialized bibliographies. Brock’s contribution to Muraoka’s Syriac grammar (1997 and 2005) covers grammatical studies. In the field of Syriac literature, the absence of a fully updated version of Baumstark is compensated to a certain extent by Brock’s <i>Brief Outline of Syriac Literature</i> (1997), which contains many bibliographical references. In addition, there are bibliographies dealing with one author, such as the very exhaustive bibliographies on <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> (Den Biesen 2002) and <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (Takahashi 2005), or the more limited ones on <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serug</ref> (Alwan 1986), <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Antioch</ref> (Mathews 2002 and 2003), and <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (Kruisheer 2008). Other bliographies are devoted to the OT <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> (Dirksen 1989 and 1995, since 1999 regularly updated in the <i>Journal for the Aramaic Bible</i>, and since 2003 in <i>Aramaic Studies</i>), <ref type="cr">liturgy</ref> (Sauget 1962 and Yousif 1990), Syriac sources on early Islam (Penn 2003 — to be used alongside Hoyland, <i>Seeing Islam</i>, and Thomas and Roggema, <i>Christian-Muslim relations</i>, vol. 1. <i>600–900</i> [2009]), <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref> (Brock 1978 and Desreumaux 1980), and Neo-Syriac (see <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref>), as part of the broader field of Neo-Aramaic (Krotkoff 1990 and Younansardaroud 2003). A bibliography of Syriac mystical literature is forthcoming (Pinggéra and Kessel). Fiey’s posthumously published <i>Saints syriaques</i> (2004) provides an introduction to Syriac hagiography and present-day hagiographical studies. A very useful survey of holdings of Syriac manuscripts world-wide is available in Desreumaux’s <i>Répertoire des manuscrits syriaques</i> (1991).</p>
<p>While the focus of scholarly monographs is obviously on the topic they study, they often provide very useful windows into segments of contemporary scholarship. Examples are R. Macuch’s 1976 book on later Syriac literature (as a sequel to Baumstark) and J. F. Coakley’s 2006 study of Syriac typography. Where Syriac is not the primary language, such as is the case for a number of apocryphal texts and for Syriac translations of Greek patristic works, the existing bibliographical tools by Geerard (1974–2003 and 1992) and Haelewyck (1998) are very helpful. Similalrly, the Christian Arabic bibliographies by Teule and Schepens (2005 and 2006) contain many items relevant to Syriac studies.</p>
<p>Along with the main periodicals in the field, collective works organized around one specific theme or field often give a convenient overview of the state of the art and provide bibliographical references. The successive volumes published in the collection ‘Études syriaques’ may be singled out as examples. They deal with inscriptions   (no. 1), apocrypha (2), liturgies (3), the Greek Fathers (4), and the OT (5). Several contributions to the volume ‘Nos sources’ (Atallah 2005) include bibliographical details as well. Bibliographies of individual scholars often are found in Festschrifts or memorial volumes, or are part of obituaries; references to such bibliographies are included in the section ‘Bibliography’ of Brock’s bibliographies.</p>

<i>ba(r)t qyāmā</i>
<p>Terms for a committed community of ascetic individuals, originating in the pre-monastic 4th cent. and continuing in various forms to the present.</p>
<p>The meaning of the term has long been debated. <i>Qyāmā</i> is derived from the root <i>qwm</i> with the basic meaning ‘to stand’, ‘to rise’, but also has the range of ‘stance’, ‘status’, ‘state’, ‘station (in life)’. From this some see the concept of ‘taking a stand’ or ‘covenant’ to have developed. A <i>bar/ba(r)t qyāmā</i> is a ‘son/daughter of the covenant’ or ‘covenanter’ (see Nedungatt) — one who has accepted or adopted the covenant of the Christian ascetical way of life. The word <i>qyāmā</i> by itself was frequently used as a synonym not only for the consecrated elite, but for the whole Syriac Christian community.</p>
<p>Some scholars believe the term suggests <i>bnay qyāmt</i><i>ā</i> ‘sons of the resurrection’ and while this requires shifting the masculine <i>qyāmā</i>to feminine <i>qyāmtā</i>, an allusion is possible with reference to Luke 20:36, ‘for they have become children of the resurrection’.</p>
<p>More recently, some scholars have explored the possible connections between <i>qyāmā</i>and the Greek term <i>kanō</i><i>n</i>(as an equivalent of ‘clergy’) and the Hebrew term <i>maʿămād</i> (especially in the Jewish institution of the <i>anšē maʿăm</i><i>ād</i>)<ref type="cr"> (see Macina, as well as M. J. Pierre, <i>Aphraate, le Sage persan: Les exposés</i> [SC 249; 1988], 99 n. 84).</ref></p>
<p>The principle source for the early history of the <i>bnay/bnāt qyāmā</i> is <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>’s Sixth Demonstration, ‘On the <i>Bnay Qyām</i><i>ā</i>’, particularly in the section dubbed ‘Aphrahaṭ’s Rule’ (<i>Dem</i>. 6.8). Celibacy is no longer a requirement for inclusion, nor is absolute poverty required as almsgiving is encouraged. Fervent faith, evidenced in zealous fasting and prayer, is the foundation. Much attention is directed to sincere and careful speech, avoiding gossip and envious feelings, as well as treating enemies and evil ones without enmity.</p>
<p>The goal is the imitation of Christ, whereby Aphrahaṭ used the term <ref type="cr">iḥidāyā</ref> ‘solitary, single’, as a synonym for <i>bar/ba(r)t qyāmā</i>, <i>iḥidāyā</i> being also the term for Christ, ‘the Only-Begotten One’ (Greek <i>monogenēs</i>). The <i>bnay/bnāt qyāmā</i> were solitaries who followed the way of the <i>Iḥidāyā</i>.</p>
<p>Aphrahaṭ cautions against excessive behavior, fancy clothes and hair, and going to intemperate feasts. His greatest concern is the practice of ‘spiritual marriage’ among males and females of the <i>qyā</i><i>mā</i> who live together for the purposes of helping one another in the maintenance of a household.</p>
<p>The activity of the <i>bnay/bnāt qyāmā</i> is referred to in a number of later documents and contexts. <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> reputedly organized and conducted a choir of <i>bnāt qyāmā</i> who sang most of his hymns. The 15th canon of the Synod of Laodicea of Phrygia (between 343–81) prohibits anyone to sing in the church except <i>bn</i><i>āt qyāmā</i> and other chanters. Nearly half of the canons of <ref type="cr">Rabbula</ref>, bp. of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (411–32) deal with the <i>bnay/bnāt qyāmā</i>, proscribing excessive behavior and indicating a wide-spread presence and involvement in the administration and active ministries of local churches, towns, and villages.</p>
<p>During the 4th and 5th cent. the <i>bnay/bnāt qy</i><i>āmā</i> were novitiates living in the world, preparing for the priesthood or monastic vocation. Many used the institution as a youthful rite of passage and training experience rounding them out for a secular career upon attaining maturity. In general, communities of the <i>bnāt qyāmā</i> appear to have maintained a more vital existence than those of their male counterparts.</p>
<p>Later references to the institution are found in <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> (d. 586), whose life of Simeon the Mountaineer (<i>Lives of the Eastern Saints</i>, 16) depicts an ascetic who settles in a village, reestablishing there the church and <i>bnay qyām</i><i>ā</i>, though not without resistance; in <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref> (7th cent.); in canons of the 7th and 12th cent.; and in <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (d. 1286). Gradually, the <i>bnay/bnāt qyāmā</i> lost their status as the ascetical elite to monks and solitaries who live apart from the town and village. Monasticism proper assumed their roles, though Bar ʿEbroyo points to a brief revival of <i>bnay/bnāt</i> <i>qy</i><i>āmā</i> in the 13th cent. The term <i>ba(r)t qyāmā</i> survives in W. Syr. as <i>bath qyomo</i> to denote a priest’s wife until this day.</p>

<Author>R. A. Kitchen</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Book of Steps</head><ab type="infobox"/><i>Liber Graduum, Ktābā d-massqātā 
</i><p>Proposed dates range from mid-4th cent to ca. 430. Collection of thirty Syriac discourses (<i>memre</i>) preceded by an introductory essay (<i>mamllā</i>) on the spiritual life and the pursuit of perfection. The anonymous author gives very few historical or geographical details in the <i>memre</i>, but one reference points to a location of the author and his spiritual community in northeast Iraq near the Lesser Zab River.</p>
<p>The collection does not have a Syriac title. Its Latin title (<i>Liber Graduum)</i> was given by Michael Kmosko in his 1926 critical edition of the Syriac text (with Latin translation), referring to the ascetical steps (<i>massqātā</i>) one must climb along the steep road to the heavenly city of Christ. This term is mentioned only in two <i>memre</i>, numbers 19 and 20. Kmosko utilized fifteen mss., only three containing more than five <i>memre</i>.</p>
<p>Kmosko theorized that the the book was a primary text of the Messalian movement in the mid-to-late-
4th cent. This view was accepted by I. Hausherr and dominated scholarship for the next thirty years. In the 1950’s A. Vööbus challenged the Messalian characterization of the book and directed scholars towards its witness to early Syriac asceticism and spirituality. Others focused on the pneumatology (A. Guillaumont), ecclesiology (R. Murray), anthropology and prayer (A. Kowalski), structure (L. Wickham), and christology and asceticism (D. Juhl).</p>
<p>The thirty <i>memre</i> are of uneven length and utilize a variety of genres: extended biblical exegeses, sermons, discourses on ascetical method. The dominant theme threading throughout the collection is the description of the two statuses of Christian life: uprightness (<i>kenutā</i>) and perfection or maturity (<i>gmirutā</i>) and those individuals who attempt to embody these ways of life — the Upright (<i>kene</i>) and the Perfect (<i>gmire</i>).</p>
<p>Writing in the midst of a pre-monastic religious community, the author of the ‘Book of Steps’ attempted to counter a decline in the standards and fervor among the Perfect. The first half of the collection presents a rule for both levels as the ideal to which they aspire. The second half contains a variety of materials, with the last six <i>memre</i> advocating the legitimacy of the Upright.</p>
<p>The titles of the <i>memre</i> are: Preface by the editor of the collection; 1. Author’s introduction; 2. About those who want to become Perfect; 3. The physical and spiritual ministry; 4. On the vegetables for the sick; 5. On the milk of the children; 6. On those who are made Perfect and continue to grow; 7. On the commandments of the Upright; 8. On one who gives all he has to feed the poor; 9. On Uprightness and the love of the Upright and the prophets; 10. On fasting and the humility of body and soul; 11. On the hearing of Scripture when the Law is read before us; 12. On the hidden and public ministry of the church; 13. By the same author on the ways of the Upright; 14. On the Upright and the Perfect; 15. On Adam’s marital desire; 16. On how a person may surpass the major commandments; 17. On the sufferings of our Lord who became through them an example for us all; 18. On the tears of prayer; 19. On the discernment of the way of Perfection; 20. On the difficult steps which are on the road of the City of our Lord; 21. On the tree of Adam; 22. On the judgments which do not save those who observe them; 23. On Satan and Pharaoh and the Israelites; 24. On repentance; 25. On the voice of God and of Satan; 26. On the second law which the Lord established for Adam; 27. About the history of the thief who is saved; 28. On the fact that the human soul is not identical with the blood; 29. On the discipline of the body; 30. On the commandments of faith and the love of the solitaries.</p>

<p>City in the Ḥawrān, present-day southern Syria, ca. 120 km. south of <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>. Bostra is the Graeco-Latin name, corresponding to Buṣra or Boṣra in Syriac, Jewish Aramaic, Rabbinic Hebrew, and Arabic. Bostra was a Nabataean city which, after the Roman conquest of the Nabataean kingdom by Emperor Trajan, in 106, became the capital of the Roman province of Arabia.</p>
<p>Christianity came to the city no later than the beginning of the 3rd cent. Origen visited Bostra in 214–15 and met with the local bp. Beryllus. Bostra was ethnically, linguistically, and religiously diverse. Along with Christianity, there were local pagan cults, Judaism, and, in all likelihood, Manichaeism. One of Bostra’s famous bishops, <ref type="cr">Titus</ref> (d. before 378) is the author of an extensive refutation of Manichaeism. This important work, originally written in Greek (in which language it only partly survives) exists in its entirety in a Syriac translation that is preserved in the earliest dated Syriac ms. of 411 (London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150), written in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. In 512, bp. Julian of Bostra openly opposed <ref type="cr">Severus</ref>’s consecration as Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. He subsequently resigned and was replaced by the Miaphysite bp. Cassian. For the rest of the 6th and for the 7th cent., names of bishops are known on both the Syr. Orth. and the Chalcedonian side, which indicates that the Christians were divided. Several churches were built, renovated, or inaugurated in the 6th cent.</p>
<p>Bostra, which must have had a strong Arab component throughout its history, fell to the Arabs in 635. It is in Bostra that, according to tradition, the meeting between Muḥammad and the Christian monk <ref type="cr">Sargis Bḥira</ref> took place. For several centuries Bostra retained some of its importance, as it was on the pilgrims’ road from Damascus to Mecca. Nowadays it is a modest town, dominated by the ruins which reflect its earlier and more prosperous Christian and Muslim past.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Braun, Oskar</head><ab type="infobox"/>(1862–1931) 
<p>Syriac scholar, professor at the University of Würzburg, Germany. Born in Dillingen on the Donau, in Bavaria, Braun studied theology in Munich and was ordained a catholic priest in 1885. Following his ordination, he worked as a chaplain in the German Church of Santa Maria dell’Anima in Rome. During this time, he studied Syriac, Armenian, Arabic, and Ethiopic with <ref type="cr">Ignazio Guidi</ref> and laid the ground work for his doctoral dissertation on <ref type="cr">Mushe bar Kipho</ref>’s ‘Book of the Soul’, a German translation of which he published in 1891. After obtaining his doctor’s degree from the University of Munich in 1890, he returned to Rome. In 1894 the University of Würzburg created for him a position as extra-ordinarius professor in Semitic languages and literature. In 1907 he became full professor in Patristics at the same university, from which he retired in 1929.</p>
<p>Much of Braun’s scholarly work focuses on a Syriac ms. (in two volumes) to which Guidi drew his attention in Rome and which contains a collection of authoritative juridical texts of the Ch. of E., i.e. ms. Museo Borgiano K. VI, 4 and 3 (later incorporated into the Vatican Library as Borg. Syr. 82 and 81), a 19th-cent. copy of a 13th- or 14th-cent. ms. from <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref> (see <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>). Braun’s work on this ms. led to a number of individual studies, e.g. on <ref type="cr">Papa</ref>, <ref type="cr">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Marutha of Maypherqaṭ</ref>, as well as to his annotated GT of the Acts of the E.-Syr. councils (<i>Das Buch der Synhados</i> [1900]). The French scholar <ref type="cr">J. B. Chabot</ref> studied the same texts and published the Syriac along with a French translation in his <i>Synodicon Orientale</i> (1902). Chabot primarily based his work on the same Roman mss. as Braun, but was able to obtain a second late 19th-cent. copy of the Alqosh ms. Even in the light of Chabot’s more comprehensive edition, Braun’s work retains its value, since the two scholars worked independently of one other.</p>
<p>Another major achievement is Braun’s edition and Latin translation of the letters of the E.-Syr. Cath. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> (1914–15), again primarily based on ms. Borg. Syr. 81. Only the first volume (39 letters) appeared; the second volume, which would have contained about 20 additional letters, remained unpublished, although some of these letters were published separately by Braun or others. Finally, Braun’s German translation of select Persian martyr acts (1915), based on <ref type="cr">P. Bedjan</ref>’s edition should be singled out as another of his works that even after nearly a century has not been replaced and continues to be extremely useful.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>A self-styled ‘Western Orthodox’ body in Britain, now part of the Coptic patriarchate. The leader of the church, the Metropolitan of Glastonbury, formerly derived his episcopal succession from various sources, of which three were ultimately Syrian: 1. Julius Ferrette (1828–1904), consecrated by the Syr. Orth. Metr. of <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref> (and later Patr. Peṭros III) in 1866; 2. Joseph René Vilatte, consecrated by Mar Julius Alvares, a Syr.

All these consecrations were irregular and in later years neither of the churches concerned would recognize them. Since 1994, when the metropolitan was admitted to the Coptic synod, the church no longer emphasizes its Syrian-church connections. The Church’s magazine is the <i>Glastonbury Review</i> (see esp. no. 80 [July 1991], 18–28).</p>

<p>German Semitist. Brockelmann began the study of oriental languages as well as classical languages and history, first in Rostock and later in Breslau and Strasbourg. After earning his Ph.D. in Strasbourg in 1890 with a dissertation in Arabic studies, he became an assistant teacher at a gymnasium in the same city (1890–92). He earned his habilitation (an advanced university degree) at the University of Breslau in 1893 and became a privatdozent (lecturer) at the same institution (1893–1900). In 1895–96, he traveled to London and Constantinople to copy Arabic mss. which he intended to publish. He was appointed instructor of Arabic at the Seminar for Oriental Languages in Berlin (1900) and later professor at the universities of Breslau (1900–03), Königsberg (1903–10), Halle an der Saale (1910–22; Rector of the University in 1918/19), and Berlin (1922–23). In 1923 he returned to Breslau, where he was Rector of the University in 1932/33 and from where he retired in 1935. He returned to Halle in 1937 and continued his scholarly work with much intensity. After World War II, he accepted a position as librarian in Halle due to financial problems. In 1947, he was appointed professor of Turkish studies at Halle, a position that he held until his retirement in 1953.</p>
<p>While a gymnasium student, Brockelmann already began to occupy himself with Hebrew, Biblical Aramaic, and Syriac. His first publications, however, were devoted to Arabic. At an early date he started collecting data for his first significant publication, his <i>Lexicon Syriacum</i>, which appeared in 1895 and was distinguished from other lexica of Syriac due to its textual references, etymological data, and Latin-Syriac index. A considerably expanded second edition appeared between 1923 and 1928. The first two volumes of Brockelmann’s foundational and monumental <i>Geschichte der arabischen Literatur</i> (History of Arabic literature) appeared in 1898 and 1902, respectively. They covered all of Islamic Arabic literature (and so excluded the confessional literature of Jews and Christians in Arabic). Three substantial supplementary volumes appeared between 1937 and 1942, followed in 1943 and 1949 by the second edition of the first two volumes, to which references to the supplementary volumes were added. This masterly handbook remains indispensable up to the present day.</p>
<p>The year 1899 saw the first publication of Brockel­mann’s <i>Syrische Grammatik</i> (Syriac grammar). It included a chrestomathy and was enhanced by substantial historical linguistic explanations. It is often reprinted. Likewise, his <i>Arabische Grammatik</i> (Arabic grammar), based on a work by Albert Socin, was often reprinted. Brockelmann not only provided the impetus for the publication of the <i>Geschichte der christlichen Literaturen des Orients</i> (History of the Christian literatures of the East) in 1907, but also contributed to it a survey of Syriac literature (p. 1–66) and brief summaries of Christian Palestinian Aramaic (p. 66) and Christian Arabic literature (p. 67–74). In 1903 and 1908, Brockelmann published descriptions of oriental mss. (including Syriac mss.) in Breslau and Hamburg.</p>
<p>Brockelmann’s second major work, his two-volume <i>Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der semitischen Sprachen</i> (Outline of the comparative grammar of the Semitic languages) originated during his time in Königsberg and Halle (1908 and 1913). In its 1400 pages, Brockelmann discussed all of the Semitic languages known in his day. This work has also not yet been replaced. In 1939, he published his <i>Geschichte der islamischen Völker and Staaten</i> (History of the Islamic peoples and nations), which was translated into many languages. To the ‘Semitics’ volume of the <i>Handbook of Oriental Studies</i>, Brockelmann contributed, among other things, the section on Syriac.</p>
<p>In addition to the Semitic languages, Brockelmann also occupied himself with the research and teaching of Turkish, Armenian, Georgian, and Coptic. His unpublish­ed scholarly writings are kept in the Library of the Deut­sche Morgenländische Gesellschaft in Halle an der Saale.</p>
<p>Brockelmann’s work is characterized by an admirable versatility. He exhibited a combination of ‘an excellent memory, a distinct sense of order, a quick understanding, and the ability to correctly assess the scope of a project, along with an unbending will and an exceptional manpower’ (J. Fück).</p>
<p>Brockelmann’s main publications are <i>Lexicon Syriacum</i> (1895; 2nd ed. 1928; most recent repr. 1995); <i>Geschichte der arabischen Literatur</i> (2 vols.; 1898–1902; 2nd ed. 1943, 1949; repr. 1996); 3 supplement volumes (1937, 1938, 1943; repr. 1996); <i>Syrische Grammatik mit Paradigmen, Literatur, Chrestomathie und Glossar</i> (1899, 13th ed. 1981); ‘Die syrische und die christlich-arabische Litteratur’, in <i>Geschichte der christlichen Litteraturen des Orients</i>, ed. C. Brockelmann et al. (1907), 1–74 (2nd ed. 1909; repr. 1972); <i>Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik der semitischen Sprachen, I. Laut- und Formenlehre</i> (1908), II. <i>Syntax</i> (1913; both volumes repr. 1999); <i>Geschichte der islamischen Völker und Staaten</i> (1939); <i>Arabische Grammatik. Paradigmen, Literatur, Übungsstücke und Glossar</i> (6th ed. 1909, 25th ed. 1997); and several contributions in Handbuch der Orientalistik, I,3. <i>Semitistik</i> (1954; repr. 1964), esp. ‘Das Aramäische, einschliesslich des Syrischen’, 135–62.</p>

<p>Scholar of Assyriology, Egyptology, Syriac, Coptic and Ethiopic. Of humble origins, he learnt Hebrew and Syriac while working as a shop assistant. He was given funds to study with <ref type="cr">W. Wright</ref> at Cambridge (1878) and soon won a scholarship at Christ’s College, Cambridge. He became an assistant in the Oriental Antiquities Department of the British Museum in 1883, and in 1894 was appointed Keeper of Egyptian and Asiatic Antiquities in the British Museum, a post he held till his retirement in 1924. He was made a Knight in 1920. He made several visits to Mesopotamia (where he had a number of Syriac mss. copied for him), as well as to Egypt. Although best known for his many popular books on Egyptology, he also found time to publish numerous texts in Syriac, Coptic, and Ethiopic. His main editions and translations of Syriac texts are: <i>Solomon of Bosra, Book of the Bee</i> (1886); <i>Thomas of Marga, Book of Governors</i> (1893); <i>Philoxenus, Discourses</i> (1894); <i>History of Alexander</i> (1889); <i>Bar Hebraeus, Laughable Stories</i> (1897); <i>History of the Virgin Mary</i> (1899); <i>Life of Rabban Hormizd</i> (1902); <CharStyle:Emphasis>ʿAnanishoʿ, Book of Paradise (1904; with a subsequent edition with just the English translation, 1907; and excerpts, 1934); <i>The Syriac Book of Medicines</i> (1913); <i>The Cave of Treasures</i> (1927, translation only); <i>The Monks of Kublai Khan</i> (1928; the diary of <ref type="cr">Rabban Ṣawma</ref>; translation only); <i>Bar Hebraeus, Chronography</i> (1932).</p>

<p>Biblical and Syriac scholar. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics and then theology. In 1903 he was appointed Lecturer in Palaeography in Cambridge University, and then in 1905 Norrisian Professor of Divinity, also in Cambridge. He was one of the scholars who worked on the Sinai palimpsest of the <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Version</ref>. Most of his early publications were on Syriac topics, notably <i>S. Ephraim’s Quotations from the Gospel</i> (1901), <i>Early Eastern Christianity</i> (1904), <i>Evangelion da-Mepharreshe</i> (edition, translation, and study of the Curetonian ms. of the Old Syriac Gospels; 1904); he also completed the edition of <i>Ephrem’s Prose Refutations</i> (2 vols.; 1912, 1921) after the death of C. W. Mitchell who was killed in the First World War. In the appendix to his <i>The Religion of the Manichees</i> (1925) he edited the minute Syriac Manichaean fragments from Egypt. Most of his articles on Syriac topics were published in the <i>Journal of Theological Studies</i>. His views on early Syriac Christianity and on the authorship of the Peshitta revision of the New Testament have been very influential on English-speaking scholarship. Testimony to the enduring value of his article on <ref type="cr">Christian Palestinian Aramaic</ref> literature is the recent translation of this into Spanish.

<p>Lebanese Maronite priest and scholar. Born in the village of ʿAshqūt, he went to study in Rome, where he spent several years and made the acquaintance of Syriac scholars such as <ref type="cr">Ignazio Guidi</ref>. It was in Rome that he published in 1875 his first major work, his <i>Liber thesauri de arte poetica Syrorum</i>(1875), which is an anthology of mainly later (classical) Syriac poets with Arabic introductions. For several of these poets, such as <ref type="cr">Isḥaq Qardaḥe Shbadnaya</ref>, <ref type="cr">Israel of Alqosh</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Khamis bar Qardaḥe</ref>, Cardahi’s preliminary and fragmentary editions have not yet been replaced. In his grammar, also published in Rome (1880), Cardahi paid particular attention to Syriac meter (two later additions to his grammar followed in 1903 and in 1923). In addition to a two-volume Syriac-Arabic dictionary (published by the Imprimerie catholique in Beirut in 1887–1891), he did two major editions of later Syriac texts: the ‘Paradise of Eden’ by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (Beirut, 1889) and the ‘Book of the Dove’ by <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (Rome, 1898 — the same year in which the same text was published by <ref type="cr">P.

<LemmaTitle>Cause of Causes</head><ab type="infobox"/> (10th–12th cent.?) 
<p>W.-Syr. encyclopedic work in nine books, dealing with theology, philosophy, anthropology, and natural sciences. The last part has been lost. In the introduction the author says he had been bp. of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> for 30 years, was then banned, and later recalled; eventually he preferred to retire to monastic life. Pohlmann attributed the ‘Cause of causes’ to <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>. Nöldeke observed Arabic influence on the terminology of the ‘Cause of causes’, especially concerning the geographical knowledge of Europe, and proposed a much later date (11th or 
12th cent.). Since no one was bp. of Edessa for 30 years in the 12th cent., a possible candidate is the 11th-cent. bp. Athanasios. Baumstark interpreted the text as intended to promote mutual understanding between the various Christian denominations as well as between Christianity, Islam, and Judaism and thought that this universalistic attitude might be more consonant with the 10th cent. than later.</p>
<p>According to the author of ‘Cause of causes’, 
human knowledge may attain three different levels (natural, scriptural, and spiritual) thanks to three main sources (Reason, the Pentateuch, and the Gospels). The anthropology of ‘Cause of causes’ follows the Neo-
Platonic analogy according to which man is to nature as micro-cosmos is to macro-cosmos.</p>
<p>An extensive study of the sources has still to be made. According to Reinink, the author assimilates elements from various traditions such as the structure of hexaemeron-exegetical works (Yaʿqub of Edessa and <ref type="cr">Mushe bar Kipho</ref>) and motifs and themes of mystical-ascetical literature. Many parallels may be drawn with <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>, to whom the text is attributed in a marginal note in Latin, in ms. Vat. Lat. 6429, p. 133. The argumentation of ‘Cause of causes’, however, reflects the methodology of Christian anti-Muslim apologetics (see Christian Arabic writers such as the Melk. <ref type="cr">Theo-doros Abū Qurra</ref>, 9th cent., and the Syr. Orth. <ref type="cr">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref>, 10th cent.) and aims at strengthening the faith of a Christian, i.e. a Syr. Orth. readership living in a predominantly Islamic world.</p>

<p>Book containing a re-narration of the biblical history from the creation of the world to Pentecost by an unknown author (incorrectly ascribed to <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>). Parts of the Cave of Treasures were known to authors from the 6th cent. on. Internal evidence suggests that it was not composed before the 5th cent. (Leonhard; Ri assumes an earlier date). The ‘Cave of Treasures’ was written in Syriac, translated into Georgian and reworked in other languages. Its title refers to a legendary cave which is located near Paradise and which serves as the home as well as the place of burial and worship for the generations before the flood. For the time after the flood, the interest of the narrator shifts to Adam’s (secondary) burial place in Golgotha being the ‘center of the world’ (39.6–8) and the location of the important events of biblical history. The cave near Paradise is not mentioned any more. The text presents itself as esoteric lore and the only true background against which the Bible can be understood (43.13–4). It uses apocryphal traditions (e.g. the traditions on Adam and Eve) but also rewrites and expounds biblical texts and motifs. The ‘Cave of Treasures’ reconstructs the history of the OT by omitting the parts that are of paramount importance for Judaism, e.g. the time of Moses. The remarks on the <ref type="cr">Syriac language</ref> (24.11, 53.22–7) may betray the author’s interest in creating a distinctively Syriac version of biblical history.</p>

<p>Prefect of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan (1870–1907), editor of Syriac biblical texts. Monsignor A. M.  Ceriani is primarily known for his two impressive and carefully executed ‘photolithographic’ facsimile 
editions of early biblical mss. preserved in the Ambrosiana. The edition of the incomplete <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref> ms. (C 313 inf., 8th or 9th cent.) appeared in 1874; the edition of the OT <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> (ms. B 21 inf., 6th or 7th cent.), in two volumes, appeared between 1876 and 1883. These editions revolutionized Syriac biblical studies, as they gave scholars for the first time access to some of the earliest available mss. (both mss. came to Milan from <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>). Several decades later, the Milan Peshitta ms. was chosen as the base ms. for the critical edition of the OT Peshitta (Leiden, 1966–).</p>
<p>Ceriani was born in Uboldo (in the province of Varese, northwest of Milan) in 1828 and was ordained a priest in 1852. He entered the Ambrosian Library in 1855 and became its Prefetto in 1870. His study of Semitic languages (including Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac, and Arabic) can be traced back to his early years in the Milanese seminary, an institution to which he remained attached throughout his life as an instructor of ‘oriental’ languages, primarily Hebrew. He made two study trips to Great Britain, in 1861 and 1866, and for many years maintained epistolary contacts with F. Field (1801–85), <ref type="cr">W. Wright</ref> (1830–89), and <ref type="cr">R. Payne Smith</ref> (1818–95). He also had contacts with prelates of the Uniate Eastern churches.</p>

<p>Born in Vouvray (Indre-et-Loire, France), J.-B. Chabot entered seminary where he studied Latin and Greek and was ordained as a priest in 1885. He served as vicar in La-Chapelle-sur Loire for 2 years, and was then authorized by his bp. to further his studies in the Catholic University of Louvain, in the field of Oriental Patristics, under the direction of Lamy. He graduated in 1892 with a doctoral thesis on <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref> (<i>De S. Isaaci Ninivitae vita, scriptis et doctrina</i> [Paris, 1892]). On his return to Paris, he studied with <ref type="cr">Rubens</ref> <ref type="cr">Duval</ref> under whose direction he prepared the publication of the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>(<i>Chronique de Denys de Tell-Mahré quatrième partie: Traduction française, texte syriaque</i> [Paris, 1895]) and obtained the diploma of the École Pratique des Hautes Études. From this time on, he devoted his whole life to research in two fields, Semitic epigraphy, mainly Aramaic and Punic, and Syriac studies. In the first, he contributed through the redaction of thousands of notices of the <i>Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum</i>, and he was the main editor of the first four volumes of the <i>Répertoire d’É</i><i>pigraphie Sémitique</i> ; he published there and elsewhere many new inscriptions. His <i>Choix d’inscriptions de Palmyre</i> (Paris, 1922) is a monograph dedicated to this prestigious city. His work is also very important in North African studies where, in addition to the publication of Punic inscriptions, he explored the new field of Libyan inscriptions and published his important <i>Recueil des Inscriptions Libyques</i> in two fascicules. In Syriac studies, his primary preoccupation was to put sources at the disposal of everyone. On the one hand, the mss.: he published a supplement to the catalogue of Syriac manuscripts in the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris by Zotenberg, and inventories of various mss. collections (Greek patriarchate of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>, Ambrosian Library in Milan). On the other hand, texts: his editions of Syriac texts are numerous, with Latin translations and short commentaries. To be noted are his <i>Histoire de Mar Jabalaha III</i> (Paris 1895–96), the <i>Synodicon orientale</i>(1902), the <i>Chronique de Michel le Syrien</i> (1899–1924), and <i>La liturgie syriaque attribuée</i><i>à Saint Maron</i> (Paris 1940). He founded in 1903 and assumed the direction of the <i>Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium</i>, with sections devoted to Syriac, Coptic, Arabic and Ethiopic texts. He personally contributed several volumes (chronicles, documents on the origin of Miaphysitism, Commentary on the Gospels by <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>). A member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, he achieved a synthesis, <i>Littérature syriaque</i>, which was published in the Bibliothèque catholique des sciences religieuses, Paris, 1934.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The Chaldean Catholic Church, which today constitutes the largest Church in Iraq, is the body which has resulted from some parts of the Ch. of E. coming into communion with the see of Rome since the 15th cent. The first such union was in Cyprus as early as 1445, but the Church now traces its patriarchal line to the consecration of <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref> as ‘Patriarch of Babylon’ in 1553. Relations between his successors and Rome became attenuated, and a second patriarchal line came into being at <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>(Diyarbakır) in 1681. (The second patriarch in this line, <ref type="cr">Yawsep II</ref>, was an important literary figure.) The Diyarbakır patriarchate came to an end in 1828, and the Metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, Yoḥannan Hormez, was confirmed as patr. in 1830. The line of patriarchs has been continuous from his time until the present, although the patriarchate was moved from Mosul to <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> in 1950.</p>
<p>The present patr., since 2003, is His Beatitude Mar Emmanuel III Delly Chaldean Patriarch of Babylon. (This is his full style. Mar Emmanuel was also made a Cardinal in 2007.) His see is in Baghdad. Also In Iraq, outside Baghdad, there are archdioceses of <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>, Baṣra, Kirkuk, and Mosul, and dioceses of <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref>, Amad­iyya, ʿAqra, Sulaymaniyya (Duhok), and Zakho; in Iran: Ahwaz, Salmas and <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref>, and Tehran; Syria: <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>; Lebanon: <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>; Turkey: Istanbul (titular of Diyarbakır); Egypt: Cairo; United States: Southfield, MI and San Diego, CA. Since 1990 all the Eastern Catholic Churches have had their own Code of Canon Law. In 1990 Babel College, for higher theological and philosophical studies, was established in Baghdad, with <ref type="cr">Y. Habbi</ref>as its President (1991–2000); in 2006, however, owing to the dangerous situation in Baghdad, Babel College had to be transferred to ʿAynkawa (near Arbil). In recent decades, as a result of the Iraq-Iran War, the sanctions after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and the lack of security that has resulted from the American and British invasion in 2003, large numbers have left Iraq and there are now many more Chaldeans living either as refugees in Syria and Lebanon, or as immigrants in the <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref> (above all in North America), than remain in Iraq.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>This is the term used for the Church in India (see <ref type="cr">Thomas Christians</ref>) which is part of the Ch. of E. Although the Church in South India had originally always been part of the Ch. of E. prior to the arrival of the Portuguese, once a Latin Catholic hierarchy had been established in Goa, the indigenous Christians came to be viewed as heretical Nestorians who were in need of conversion; by the end of the 16th cent. the Portuguese authorities had effectively cut off all connections with the Ch. of  E. in the Middle East, although in the early 18th cent. two bishops of the Ch. of E. who had become Chald. (Shemʿon of ʿAda, d. 1720; and Gabriel, d. 1731) came to India where they caused considerable confusion; thus it was only in the late 19th cent. that links with the Ch. of E. were successfully revived. The process was initiated by the Chald. Catholic Patr. of Babylon, Yawsep Audo (1848–78) who, in response to a request from a delegation from Malabar headed by Antony Thondanatta, and as a result of his desire to extend his jurisdiction to India, consecrated Thoma Rokos as metropolitan based in Trichur (1861). This, however, went against the wishes of Rome, and Rokos was obliged to return to the Middle East in 1862. Since Audo had been forbidden by Rome to consecrate anyone else for Malabar, the result was that Thondanatta was consecrated later that year as Mar ʿAbdishoʿ by Mar Shemʿon Rubel, the Patr. of the Ch. of E., thus reviving the long-broken link. These links were strengthened with the appointment of two Middle Eastern metropolitans to Trichur, Mar <ref type="cr">Abimalek Timotheus</ref> (1908–45) and Mar <ref type="cr">Toma Darmo</ref> (1952–69). Relations between Mar Darmo and the Patr. broke down in the 1960s over issues of the patriarchal succession and (from 1964) the Calendar, after Mar <ref type="cr">Eshai Shemʿ<ref type="cr">on</ref> had changed to the Gregorian Calendar; in 1968 Darmo was elected as rival Patr., and one of the two Indian bishops he had ordained, Mar Aprem, became his successor as Metropolitan in Trichur. In 1971 Mar Shemʿon consecrated his own Metropolitan of Malabar, thus strengthening the schism between the Old and New Calendarists in India. Following the assassination of Mar Shemʿon in 1975 and the election of Mar Denḥa IV as his successor in 1976, Mar Aprem (at that time under Mar Addai II) was active in trying to bring the two sides together, but it was only in 1995 that unity was achieved as far as the Indian situation was concerned, and the Chald. Syrian Church in India became united with Mar Dinkha.</p>
<p>Mar Timotheos had been anxious to set up a printing press in Trichur, and with this in mind he brought <ref type="cr">Yawsep d-Beth Qelayta</ref> to India, but it was only in 1926, after Yawsep had left, that the Mar Narsai Press was established in Trichur, in order to print Syriac liturgical texts. However, it was not until the time of Mar Darmo that many Syriac texts were published; amongst these was the <i>Ḥudrā</i>(3 vols.; 1960–62), as well as a few literary texts (including some in Modern Syriac). At the time of the disputes between Mar Darmo and the Patr., numerous pamphlets were produced at the Press. Since Mar Darmo’s death, apart from the printing (in 1982) of Timotheos I’s Letters (1–38), left ready by Darmo, hardly any further Syriac texts were published, apart from offset reproductions.</p>
<p>The Chaldean Syrian Church is said to have ca. 30,000 adherents.</p>

</ref><p>1. Members of the <ref type="cr">Chaldean Catholic Church</ref>. Those from the Ch. of E. who joined the Roman communion were first called Chaldeans in the brief <i>Benedictus sit Deus</i> of Pope Eugenius IV (1445) in order to distinguish them from ‘Nestorian’ heretics.</p>
<p>2. A term used in modern times for the ethnic group comprising both Chald. Catholics and members of the Assyrian Ch. of E. The idea that E.-Syr. Christians were properly called Chaldeans on account of a historical connection with the ancient people of that name can be found in 19th-cent. books by W. Ainsworth, A. H. Layard, and Hormuzd Rassam. This idea was taken up by P. Nasri (1905) and <ref type="cr">Addai Scher</ref> (1912) and then by other nationalistic writers from the Chaldean church who wanted an alternative to the <ref type="cr">Assyrian</ref> ethnology that was linked to the Assyrian Ch. of E. Recent writers have taken a more nuanced position, allowing both names, Assyrian and Chaldean, as ‘symbols of ethnic identity and pride’ appropriate to Christians with ancient roots in Mesopotamia, yet preferring Chaldean as reflecting ‘a more comprehensive and generic identity’ (S. Jammo).</p>

<p>One of the centers of the <ref type="cr">Assyrian</ref> <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref> in the USA. The first Assyrians in Chicago in the 1890s were young men who had attended American mission schools in <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref>, Persia. By 1924, the population was reported to be 2,327; this reflected immigration after the displacement of Assyrians from Persia and <ref type="cr">Hakkari</ref> after World War  I. The main Assyrian church was the Carter Memorial Presbyterian Church, but other Protestant denominations, as well as the <ref type="cr">Chaldean Syrian Church</ref> and the <ref type="cr">Ch. of E.</ref>, were also represented. Newer immigrants, in considerable numbers since the 1950s, have been from Iraq, and Assyrians of Iraqi origin now predominate in the community. The patriarchatal see of the Church of the East was in Chicago 1940–54 (under Mar<ref type="cr"> Eshai Shemʿon</ref>) and is so again since 1976 under Mar Denḥa IV.

<Author>J. F. Coakley</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>China, Syriac Christianity in 
</LemmaTitle><p>It remains uncertain when Christians first reached the main, historically Chinese-speaking (Han), part of China. The tradition of making St. Thomas the apostle of China, which appears in such E.-Syr. sources as <ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref>’s <i>Fiqh al-naṣrāniyya</i> (VI.1.41, ed. Hoenerbach-Spies II.138.7–8), <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>’s <i>Nomocanon</i> (IX.1, ed. Mai 317a 14–15), and the Chaldean breviary, can be found in its nascent form in the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref> and may have originated in the late Sasanian period (see Tubach 1995–6). Although it is likely that individual Christians travelling along the Silk Road reached China before the 7th cent., there is little evidence to support the historicity of the tradition reported by ʿAbdishoʿ (<i>Nomocanon</i> VIII.15, ed. Mai 304a 20–21) which credits the Ch. of E. Catholicoi Aḥai (410–414) and Shila (503–523) with the erection of a metropolitan see for China. ʿAbdishoʿ himself gives the credit to Ṣliba Zka (714–28), while Ishoʿyahb (probably <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> [649–59]) is given the honor by Ibn al-Ṭayyib (<i>Fiqh al-naṣrāniyya</i> VI.1.16, ed. Hoenerbach-Spies II.121.4–5). The existence of metropolitans for China in the time of <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> (780–823) is attested to by his letter mentioning the death of a ‘metropolitan of Beth Ṣinaye’ (Letter 13, ed. Braun 109.22–23) and by the report by <ref type="cr">Toma of Marga</ref>, told on the authority of Timotheos, of Dawid, a monk of <ref type="cr">Beth</ref> ʿ<ref type="cr">Abe</ref>, being elected metropolitan for ‘Beth Ṣinaye’ (‘Book of Governors’, IV.20, ed. Budge 238.14–15).</p>
<p>The history of Christianity in China as recorded in the so-called <ref type="cr">Xi’an</ref> Stele (erected in 781) and other Chinese documents begins with the arrival of the missionary Aluoben in Chang’an (present-day Xi’an) in 635 and his reception by Emperor Taizong (626–49). The Stele goes on to tell us of the progress of Christianity in China under the protection of the successive emperors. Like the <ref type="cr">Thomas Christians</ref> in India, the Syriac Christians in China were subject to bishops sent to them from their mother Church in the West. If the term <i>dade</i> used in the Stele is equivalent to ‘bishop’ (or ‘metropolitan’), these bishops will include, besides Aluoben, Jilie (Gabriel) in the first half of 8th cent., Jihe (Giwargis or Gigoy?), who arrived in 744, and Yaolun (Yoḥannan), who was <i>dade</i> and <i>apesqopā</i> at the time of the erection of the Stele.</p>
<p>Chinese records from the early Tang period refer to Christianity as the religion of Persia (Bosi) and, after 745, as that of the Roman (or Byzantine) Empire (<i>Da Qin</i>), while the Christians themselves called their religion <i>Jingjiao</i>, or the ‘luminous religion’. The Persian term <i>tarsā</i> was also sometimes used of Christians in China and appears in the form <i>dasuo</i> in the Xi’an Stele. Although there is evidence for the existence of a number of Christian communities outside Chang’an, the passage of the Stele telling us that monasteries were built in every ‘prefecture’ of the land (of which there were approximately 360) during the reign of Gaozong (650–83) is clearly exaggerated. It is likely that Christians, like the Manicheans and Zoroastrians who also entered China along the Silk Road in the middle of the first millennium, remained a small minority and, consisting mainly of peoples of Iranian origin (Persians and Sogdians), were generally regarded as a ‘foreign’ element within the Chinese population.</p>
<p>The decline of <i>Jingjiao</i> in the 9th cent. is no doubt to be attributed to increasing political instability and difficulty of travel along the Silk Road. Emperor Wuzong’s edict of 845 proscribing ‘foreign’ religions, though aimed primarily at Buddhists, evidently had a devastating effect on Christianity, as well as on Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism, in China. Little is heard of the Christians in China after 845, although the mention in an Arabic source of ‘Christians’, along with Muslims, Jews, and Zoroastrians, among the groups massacred in Guanzhou (Canton) during the rebellion of Huang Chao in 878/9 has been interpreted as indicating their survival for a period in southern China, while the wording of the colophon of the ms. containing the <i>Sanwei mengdu zan</i> and <i>Zun jing</i> (nos. 3 and 4 below) has been understood to indicate that it was copied after the fall of the Tang Dynasty in 907, suggesting the survival of Christian communities using Chinese after that date.</p>
<p>Besides in the Xi’an Stele (properly, the ‘Monument on the propagation of the Religion of the Light of Da Qin in China’, <i>Da Qin Jingjiao liuxing Zhongguo bei</i>), what remains of the literary activities of the Christians in Chinese during the Tang period is to be found in a number of documents discovered in the early 20th cent. in Dunhuang. The so-called Dunhuang Christian documents comprise: 1. <i>Xuting Mishisuo jing</i> (‘Book of Jesus-Messiah’ or ‘Book of listening to the Messiah’; Takakusu ms.); 2. <i>Yishen lun</i> (‘Discourse on the One God’, consisting of three disparate treatises; Tomioka ms.); 3. <i>Da Qin Jingjiao Sanwei mengdu zan</i> (‘Hymn in adoration of the Holy Trinity’); 4. <i>Zun jing</i> (‘Book of honor’ or [list of] ‘Venerable books’); 5. <i>Zhi xuan anle jing</i> (‘Book on attaining profound peace and joy’); 6a. Beginning of <i>Da Qin Jingjiao Xuan yuan zhiben jing</i> (‘Book of proclamation of the highest origin of origins’); 6b. End of <i>Da Qin Jingjiao Xuan yuan zhiben jing</i> (Kojima ms. B); 7. <i>Da Qin Jingjiao Dasheng tongzhen guifa zan</i> (‘Hymn of praise for the Transfiguration of Our Lord’; Kojima ms. A). Of these, no. 3 is a paraphrase of the Great Doxology (i.e. the equivalent of the Latin <i>Gloria [in excelsis Deo]</i>); the remaining texts, though clearly Christian in content, appear to be original compositions and have no known counterparts in Syriac. No. 6b is now known to be a modern forgery, and the same is most likely to be the case with no. 7. Nos. 1 and 2 have been associated by scholars with the missionary activity of Aluoben. It has been suggested that the manuscripts we have today of these two texts too are modern forgeries, though based on genuine Tang-Dynasty documents (see Lin 2006). The remaining texts have been judged to date from a later period; nos.  3, 5, and 6 may have been composed by Jingjing, who was responsible also for the text of the Xi’an Stele. An important new addition was made to this corpus in 2006 with the discovery in Luoyang, the ‘eastern capital’ of the Tang Dynasty, of a stone pillar, which was erected by a family evidently of Sogdian origin in 814/5 and which, though missing its lower part, is inscribed with a more complete text of no. 6 than is found in the Dunhuang manuscript (see Ge 2009 and Tang 2009).</p>
<p>After the turn of the millennium, the presence of Syriac Christians in China becomes perceptible again during the 12th cent. with the movement into northern China of those Turkic tribes that counted E.-Syr. converts among their members, and reached a new peak during the period of the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), whose Mongol rulers were in close marital and political alliances with Turco-Mongol tribal federations with strong Christian elements, such as the Kerait and the Öngüt. The open religious policy of Genghis Khan and his heirs, the expansion of their empire to the far western parts of Eurasia, and the resulting facilitation of east-west travel both by land and by sea led to the arrival also of non-Syriac Christians in China, including Latin missionaries and traders, as well as Armenians, Alans, and Georgians. The term <i>Yelikewen</i> (Turkic/Mongolian <i>Erke’ün</i>), whose etymology remains unclear, was used to refer to Christians of all these denominations in the Chinese records from this period.</p>
<p>We learn from the ‘History of Mar Yahbalaha’ that there was a Ch. of E. metropolitan in Khan Baliq (Dadu, modern Beijing), which Khubilai Khan officially made his capital in 1272, by the middle of the 13th cent., and it was from Khan Baliq that <ref type="cr">Rabban Ṣawma</ref> and the Öngüt monk Marqos, the future Cath. <ref type="cr">Yahbalaha III</ref>, set out for the West in around 1275. As during the Tang period, the Christian population of Yuan China evidently consisted largely of ‘foreign’, non-Han, elements, usually of Turkic origin. Official and semi-official Chinese sources, accounts left by members of Latin mendicant orders and by Marco Polo, and archaeological evidence, including a large number of crosses and funerary inscriptions, sometimes written in Syriac and more often in Turkic in Syriac script (see <ref type="cr">Inscriptions</ref>, ‘Central and East Asia’), testify to the presence of Syriac Christians, besides in cities along the Silk Road, especially in Inner Mongolia and in the southern port city of Quanzhou (Zaitun), as well as in the area around Beijing and in commercial centers around the lower reaches of the Changjiang (Yangtze River), such as Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The history of Syriac Christianity in China more or less came to a close with the fall of the Yuan Dynasty to the native Chinese Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), although the possible survival of some descendants of these Christians into a later period is suggested by a fragmentary ms. of <ref type="cr">Qdām w-Bāthar</ref> which was discovered within the imperial palace complexes in Beijing in 1909 and may date from the 15th or 16th cent.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>A Late Aramaic dialect (also misleadingly known as Palestinian Syriac) which was employed by Chalcedonian Christian communities in Palestine and Transjordan from ca. 5th–14th cent., after which it disappeared. The oldest texts (ca. 5th–8th centuries) are inscriptions and fragmentary mss. (often in the form of the underwriting in palimpsest mss., many of which are connected with <ref type="cr">St. Catherine’s Monastery</ref>, Sinai). Complete mss. (all liturgical) only date from the 11th cent. or later. All the surviving literary texts are translations from Greek, the only exception being a short magical work. The older mss. contain biblical and patristic texts, the former often being in the form of lectionaries, whose rubrics sometimes conform with the old Jerusalem liturgical rite which is otherwise best attested in Armenian and Georgian sources. The best preserved (though none is complete) among the patristic texts are parts of <ref type="cr">Cyril of Jerusalem</ref>’s Catecheses, and two hagiographical texts, the ‘Forty Martyrs of Sinai’, and the narrative concerning Eulogius the Stonecutter (belonging to the cycle of texts associated with Daniel of Scetis). Other very fragmentary texts include some works attributed to <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> (but which are only known in Greek), and the narratives of Alexis the <ref type="cr">Man of God</ref> and of Abraham of Qidun (both of which reached Christian Palestinian Aramaic by way of Greek). There are also fragments of <ref type="cr">Athanasius</ref>’s ‘Life of Antony’, a homily on the Prodigal Son attributed to <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref>, various Apophthegmata, and some apocryphal and hagiographical texts.</p>
<p>Among the later mss. are three dated Gospel Lectionaries, of 1030, 1104, and 1118. The first of these (ms. Vat. Syr. 19) was the first text in this dialect to be published (in 1861–4). Also from the later period are two further important liturgical mss., a Euchologion and a Horologion.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The (anonymous) Chronicle of 1234 is a developed universal chronicle (<i>maktbonuto d-zabne</i>) first composed in 1204. From the reign of Constantine the Great onward the text is divided into a secular and an ecclesiastical history. After the concluding remarks for the year 1204, there are additional entries in the secular history up to 1234 (with some references extending to 1237), ending with a lacuna, and in the ecclesiastical history up to 1207, where the ms. breaks off. It is doubtful if these additions were made by the original author.</p>
<p>The text was preserved in a 14th cent. ms. the whereabouts of which are now unknown. In the 19th  cent. 
the ms. had been repaired by inserting new folia replacing damaged parts, although some parts were beyond repair. Chabot maintains that the text of the new folia was copied from the damaged 14th-cent. ms.</p>
<p>The original author was a younger contemporary of Patr. <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> (1166–99) and in 1173 was present at the patriarchal residence in the <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref>. He also personally experienced the conquest of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> by Saladin in 1187, when Athanasios, the brother of Michael, was bp. of Jerusalem. He accompanied Maph. Grigorios, nephew of Michael, to <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref> and the eastern dioceses in 1189 and seems to have been part of Grigorios’ entourage. He has detailed knowledge of the affairs of Michael and his family and is a staunch supporter of Michael. The author explicitly states that he will describe history as a succession of (religious) leadership from the first day of Creation to his own day, a succession of men, not of events. The Chronicle is based on the Eusebian model, but follows the later Syriac tradition in using many large narrative entries, sometimes even preserving the chapter structure of the sources. He, however, sometimes edits these sources. Although sharing many sources with Michael, the selection of material seems to have been made independently. He uses large fragments from the works of <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref> (or rather an extended Syriac version), <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>, <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>, <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref>, Basil of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, and other sources. He also uses pseudepigraphical material, especially for the time before Abraham, most notably from Jubilees and the <ref type="cr">Cave of Treasures</ref>. There are also traces of unknown Arabic sources.</p>

Gr. 180) to AD 540, i.e. from the pre-Christian period (when Edessa was a kingdom under the <ref type="cr">Abgarids</ref>) well into the time that most of Edessa was Christian. The work opens with an elaborate account of a flood in Edessa in November AD 201 (no. 1; this contains a brief mention of damage done to ‘the sanctuary [<i>hayklā</i>] of the church of the Christians’), and then steps back to the year 133/2 BC, which is said to be when kings began to reign in Edessa (no. 2). With the exception of the flood account, the entries are few and sparse until the beginning of the 4th cent., when Bp. Qune is mentioned (no. 12). From then onwards entries become more frequent and more substantial, and regularly provide the names of the ruling bps. of the city. There are brief and rather detached references to <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>(no. 46), to Bps. <ref type="cr">Rabbula</ref> (nos. 51 and 59) and <ref type="cr">Hiba</ref> (nos. 59, 60, 64, and 68), to the 449 Council of Ephesus (no. 63), to the Council of Chalcedon (no. 66), to the closure of the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref> in 488/9 (no. 73), and to the anti-Chalcedonian policy of Emp. Anastasius (nos. 77, 83, and 84). The author’s language, however, becomes more personal when he reports about the religious policy of Emperors Justin I (518–527) and Justinian (527–565), and he empathetically mentions Justinian’s concern and care (<i>bṭiluthā w-yaṣṣiputhā</i>) to have the four synods (including the one of Chalcedon) recognized (no. 95). It is likely, therefore, that this reflects the author’s own religious (Chalcedonian) perspective.</p>
<p>As the city archives are explicitly mentioned at the end of the flood account, the author may very well have had access to them, directly or, more likely, indirectly. Since some of the later Chronicles reflect the use of archival materials as well, it has been suggested that the chronicler excerpted entries from an earlier and more comprehensive chronicle (‘Original Chronicle of Edessa’), from which also some of the later chroniclers drew (see Witakowski).</p>
<p>As one of the rare sources with a focused interest in the early history of Edessa, the short Chronicle has received much attention in modern scholarship. The Chronicle’s extreme paucity of data on Christianity in Edessa prior to the beginning of the 4th cent.—while, tellingly, <ref type="cr">Marcion</ref> (no. 6), <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref> (no. 7), and <ref type="cr">Mani</ref> (no.  10) are explicitly mentioned—led Bauer to challenge the traditional view that ‘orthodox’ Christianity preceded ‘heresy’ in Edessa, and to posit that prior to the early 4th cent. various Christian groups vied for power. It was only in the 4th cent., in his view, that ‘orthodox’ Christianity was able to assert itself and to oppress ‘non-orthodox’ groups, whose literary history subsequently fell into oblivion or was deliberately erased. In addition, scholars have noted the absence in the Chronicle of any reference to the conversion of the Abgarids or to the mission of Addai. This has contributed to the view that the legend of Addai, as found in the <ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref>, represents an attempt at ‘orthodox’ rewriting of early Edessene Christian history, an attempt that—as <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> shows in the 4th cent. and the Chronicle of Edessa in the 6th—was not necessarily universally accepted.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Chronicles, Syriac</LemmaTitle> <LemmaTitle>
</LemmaTitle><p>There are two basic types of chronicles in Syriac, local and universal (or world) chronicles. Local chronicles discuss the historical, religious, military, and economic conditions of specific regions, though incidental information on world history can also be included. The earliest local chronicle is the so-called Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Yeshuʿ the Stylite</ref>, which deals with the effects of the Byzantine-Sasanian warfare on the Jazīra region in the early 6th cent. Universal chronicles deal with human history from the beginning of the world to the time of the writer. While early human history is based mostly on the Bible, the Hellenistic and subsequent periods are based on a variety of sources, mostly but not uniquely Greek, and for the Islamic period Syriac and sometimes Arabic sources are also used. The earliest universal chronicle is that of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (d. 708), which includes a chronography and canons up to the year 692, extended by someone else to the year 710. This chronicle is incompletely preserved, though some gaps can be filled with quotations made from it by <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (d. 1046) and 
<ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> (d. 1199). The <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref> written in 774 is universal but its latter part (part 4) is essentially local, concentrating on the economy of the Jazīra under the early Abbasids. Several universal chronicles are known only by the names of their authors, while others survived as extracts in other similar works. This is the case of the chronicle of Patr. <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> 
(d. 845) largely quoted in <ref type="cr">Chronicle of 1234</ref> (see below) and in the Chronicle of Patr. Michael Rabo. The latter massive Chronicle is divided into three parts in three columns, covering civil and religious histories in two columns and various events in the third one, all up to the year 1195. The chronicle was translated into Armenian and Arabic, though it survived in only one Syriac ms. The last two universal chronicles are the anonymous Chronicle of 1234 and the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (d.  1286), both divided into two rather than three parts, covering secular and ecclesiastical histories. In Bar ʿEbroyo’s Chronicle, secular history begins with the creation of the world and ends with the Mongol invasion, witnessed by the chronicler. The ecclesiastical history starts with Aaron and subsequent high priests; in the Christian era the chronicler concentrates on the patriarchs of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> and by the 7th cent. attention is drawn to the Syriac maphrians. In terms of genres, local chronicles are rooted in annals preserved in royal courts in such cities as <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> under the <ref type="cr">Abgarids of Edessa</ref> and presumably elsewhere. Reference to the royal archives of Edessa is made by <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref> (d. 339), the mid-6th century <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, and Chronicle of 724. Syriac universal chronicles are modeled after Eusebius’s Chronicon and canons, of which there is more than one Syriac translation, though none has survived completely. Syriac writers followed Eusebius closely but not blindly. Thus, Yaʿqub of Edessa, in his Chronicle and canons made after Eusebius, supplements the list of rulers with names of Sasanian figures, corrects a calculation error in his model, and uses additional computation systems. This is also the attitude of the E.-Syr. Eliya of Nisibis in the first part of his Chronography, where the material is organized differently from his Eusebian model and in which he added information of interest to his own Church.</p>

<Author>A. Harrak</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Church of the East
</LemmaTitle><p>The Church of the East traces its history to the earliest planting of Christianity in the Persian Empire. The fact that the church developed outside the Roman Empire and its conciliar process partly explains its particular doctrinal tradition. It represents a third position in the three-way split in Eastern Christianity that resulted from the Christological controversies of the 5th/6th cent., alongside the Syriac (and other Oriental) Orthodox and the Chalcedonian (Melkite, Rum) Orthodox Churches. The Church of the East follows the strictly dyophysite (‘two-nature’) christology of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, as a result of which it was misleadingly labelled as ‘Nestorian’ by its theological opponents.</p>
<p>Especially in the second half of the first millennium the Church expanded eastwards, reaching <ref type="cr">China</ref> and south India (where the E.-Syr. tradition remains prominent today; see <ref type="cr">Thomas Christians</ref>). From the 14th cent. onwards, however, the Church of the East became greatly diminished on account of plague, oppression, and periodic massacres. In the mid 16th cent. a separate patriarchal line developed, in communion with Rome (see <ref type="cr">Chaldean Catholic Church</ref>). By the 19th cent., the territory of the Church of the East was practically limited to the highlands of <ref type="cr">Hakkari</ref> in Turkey and the plain around the city of <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref> in Iran. (Some congregations in India were reclaimed by the consecration of a bp. for them in 1907.) An estimated third of its people were victims of the massacres just before, during, and in the aftermath of the First World War (see <ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref>). The remnant of the Church were forced to settle in Iraq as refugees. Following the killing of Assyrian civilians by the Iraqi army at Semele in 1933, the Catholicos Patriarch (Mar <ref type="cr">Eshai</ref> <ref type="cr">Shemʿon</ref>, then still treated as the civil head of all the <ref type="cr">Assyrians</ref>) was expelled from Iraq.</p>
<p>In 1968 the Church suffered a schism, the immediate cause of which was the adoption of the New Calendar mandated by Mar Shemʿon in California. The government of Iraq favored the anti-Mar Shemʿon party and facilitated the election of Mar <ref type="cr">Toma Darmo</ref> as a counter patr. Mar Darmo also made an issue of his opposition to the hereditary succession to the patriarchate. However, Mar Shemʿon had no nephews to succeed him, and in 1976, following his assassination, the new patr. Mar <ref type="cr">Denḥa</ref> IV was elected canonically. The issue of succession thus no longer divides the two Church bodies, but other historical issues (of which the calendar is only one) and animosities continue to do so. Both Churches have now (2009) agreed to hold a joint synod to try to resolve differences (in India the matter was already resolved in 1995). Both Churches have large diasporas, especially in North America (see <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref>).</p>
<p> 1. Assyrian Church of the East: Mar <ref type="cr">Denḥa</ref> IV fixed the name of the Church as the ‘Holy Catholic Apostolic Assyrian Church of the East’. Like his predecessor he resides in the United States, although in <ref type="cr">Chicago</ref> rather than California. There are dioceses in Iraq (<ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>, Duhok), Syria (al-Ḥasake), Lebanon (<ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>), Western Europe (Norsborg, Sweden), Western United States (Glendale, Arizona), California, Canada (Toronto), India (Trissur), and Australia (Sydney). The bp. of Duhok also has responsibility for Russia (where there is a thriving church in Moscow). Since the mid 1980s the Ch. of the East has been actively involved in <ref type="cr">Ecumenical dialogue</ref> with the Catholic Church, and in 1994 Mar <ref type="cr">Denḥa</ref> IV and Pope John Paul II issued a historic common statement on christology. In 1997 the synods of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church agreed to take common steps to restore union between the two Churches; this process, however, has encountered a number of obstacles and little progress has been made so far.</p>
<p>2. Ancient Church of the East: The Church under Mar Toma Darmo (d. 1968) and his successor Mar Addai II (1972–) adopted the name ‘Ancient Church of the East’, to difference itself from the larger ‘Assyrian’ Church (and possibly to avoid a nationalistic-sounding name in Iraq). Mar Addai is resident in Baghdad. Outside Baghdad there are dioceses of Kirkuk, Nineveh (<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>), Syria and Lebanon (residing in al-<cCase:All Caps>ḥ<cCase:>asake), Western Europe (Mainz, Germany), United States and Canada (San Fernando), and Western United States (Modesto). The Ancient Church of the East, as well as the Assyrian Church of the East, has been present at Pro Oriente’s Non-Official ‘Syriac Dialogue’ since its inception in 1994.</p>

<Author>G. A. Kiraz</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Clement of Rome and 
Pseudo-Clementine literature</head><ab type="infobox"/> 
<p>Bp. of Rome (ca. 88 – ca. 97) and author. Clement has traditionally been identified as the author of 1 Clement, a pastoral letter written in Greek in Rome (ca. 96), responding to problems associated with a schism in the church at Corinth. A number of later works came also to be linked spuriously with Clement. The resulting corpus has left traces in several strands of the Syriac tradition.</p>
<p>From an early date, 1 Clement circulated with an anonymous homily titled 2 Clement, composed ca. 130–150 in Syria or Egypt. A Syriac version of both texts occurs in a ms. containing the complete Ḥarqlean NT (ms. Camb. Add. 1700, dated 1170). In that ms., 1–2 Clement appear with the Catholic Epistles and have been fully incorporated into the lectionary cycle. Although the scribe appears to have believed 1–2 Clement were translated with the rest of the Ḥarqlean NT, the version is in fact distinct, probably 7th-cent, and possibly a product of the School of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>. Fragments of a somewhat revised version of 1 Clement survive in a few modern Syriac mss.</p>
<p>Two ascetical letters ‘To the Virgins’ were attributed to Clement as early as <ref type="cr">Epiphanius</ref>’s time, but were in fact composed in the late 3rd or early 4th cent., probably in a Syro-Palestinian environment. The Greek survives only in fragments, but a Syriac version exists in a 15th-cent. ms. (now in Amsterdam, ed. Beelen) and in two more recent mss. (Birmingham, Mingana Syr. 480 [see Brock] and Manchester, John Rylands Libr., Syr. 11). There are also some earlier fragments in Coptic and in a few Syriac anthologies.</p>
<p>The Pseudo-Clementines comprise the Homilies and the Recognitions, two interdependent 4th-cent. works that appear to go back to a common source from mid-3rd-cent. Syria. Together they present a colorful, if fictional, account of Clement’s conversion to Christianity, his subsequent adventures with the apostle Peter, and his reunion with his family. Composed in Greek, the Pseudo-Clementines quickly found their way into Syriac  — the very early ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150 (dated 411) contains substantial portions of the Recognitions and the Homilies, as does the 6th-cent. ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,609. The two texts are the work of different translators. Late Greek copies of the Homilies are extant, but the Recognitions, apart from very small fragments, have been lost in Greek. They survive only in Rufinus’s Latin translation and in the Syriac version, which is the more reliable. Adaptations of the Pseudo-Clementines’s narrative material also appear in later Syriac epitomes.</p>
<p>A collection of canons known as the Octateuch of Clement was translated into Syriac in the late 7th cent. Supposed to reflect the editorial work of Clement, the Octateuch contains such works as the Apostolic Constitutions and the <ref type="cr">Testament of our Lord Jesus Christ</ref>. Often copied, excerpted, and translated, the Syriac version widely influenced canon law in Eastern Christian traditions. A number of W.-Syr. liturgical mss. have an Anaphora attributed to Clement, the final form of which probably dates no earlier than the 7th cent.</p>

<Author>J. W. Childers</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Colophons
</LemmaTitle><p>Colophons, or notes added by the scribe at the end of a ms. that he is copying, often provide a great deal of valuable information; this will often consist of the scribe’s name (and parentage), date, place of writing, the person who commissioned the work and its destination, and the name(s) of the reigning hierarchs. For the date, the Seleucid era is normally used (to find the AD equivalent, subtract 311, or if the month is Oct.-Dec., 312). Already by the late 7th cent. the Hijra dating is sometimes also used, and Melkite mss. frequently employ the Byzantine World Era (subtract 5508, or if Sep.–Dec., 5509). Other eras (e.g. of the Ascension) are only rarely found. From the 17th cent. onwards the Christian era is also employed, sometimes in conjunction with the Seleucid (which continued in use well into the 20th cent.). In India the Kulam era (beginning AD 825) is sometimes used. Dates given (sometimes including the hour as well as the day) will refer to that of completion; only rarely does the scribe indicate when he started: a recent example is provided by Mor<ref type="cr"> Julius Çiçek</ref>’s calligraphed Gospel Lectionary, published in 1987: his long colophon states that it took him 340 hours, starting on 5 Jan. and finishing on 4 Feb. Information about the place of writing, if not a monastery, may include the church, as well as the village or town. Later owners have sometimes substituted later names, erasing the original ones. In order to discourage unauthorized removal of a ms. dire curses on any would-be culprit may be provided. Further information of a purely historical nature is occasionally to be found in colophons: a dramatic example of this is in a ms. written in <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> in 1149 (ms. Damascus, Patr. 12/4) whose colophon describes the capture of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> by Zengi in 1144 (ET by A. N. Palmer, in <i>OC</i> 76 [1992], 85–7).</p>
<p>The oldest dated Christian ms. in any language is Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150, whose colophon states that it was written in Edessa and completed in Nov. 411. A  number of formulaic features are apt to reappear, such as the comparison of the scribe reaching his last line with that of a ship, or sailor, reaching harbor; this particular example, first known from a ms. of 543, and still in use in modern times, is also found in Greek and Latin mss.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The term ‘Syriac Computing’ was coined in 1992 with the establishment of the Syriac Computing Institute, the forerunner of Beth Mardutho: The Syriac Institute, and took shape in 1995 when the First International Forum on Syriac Computing was held in conjunction with the Second Syriac Symposium in Washington, DC (see <ref type="cr">Syriac Conferences</ref>). The term applies to computer-related activities and projects which support Syriac studies. Previous activities covered the following domains:</p>
<p>1. Lexicography and concordance generation. The main focus of projects in the past has been on computational lexicography. The first computational project, which was done at UCLA probably around the 1960s, encoded Brockelmann’s <i>Lexicon Syriacum</i> on a mainframe, but nothing more is known about it. In the 1970s, the Göttingen-based Göttinger Syrische Konkordanz pro­ject produced OT text concordances under the direction of Werner Strothmann, and The Way International produced a morphologically tagged database for the text of the NT. In the 1980s, the Peshitta Institute in Leiden developed further systems for the creation of OT concordances. Also in the 1980s, G. Kiraz developed the SEDRA database for the text of the NT. In the 1990s, Brigham Young University commissioned G.  Kiraz to develop the Bar Bahlul lexical database. The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon project, under the direction of Stephen Kaufman, collects texts and lexical resources, taggs them morphologically, and makes them available online, and has produced a concordance of the <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Version</ref>of the Gospels. More involved linguistic ana­lysis of Syriac texts is part of the CALAP and Turgama projects of the Peshitta Institute where the aim is to analyze texts at the word, phrase, clause, and text levels.</p>
<p>2. Word processing and desktop publishing. The first publications that employed computer technology for the production of Syriac text, viz. the concordances of the Göttingen project, used plotter technology. With the rise of personal computers in the early 1980s, a number of non-commercial Macintosh-based outline fonts were available. Users of the DOS platform primarily used the bitmap fonts made by Alaph Beth Computer System for a program called Multi-Lingual Scholar (Gamma Productions, Inc.) from 1986 onward. When Windows became ubiquitous in the 1990s, a few True­Type outline fonts became available, but texts had to be typed either backward or on the Arabic version of Windows. The development of the bi-directional Windows 2000 and XP operating systems provided native bi-directional editing for the first time at the operating system level. At the same time, OpenType font technology allowed for encoding language-specific features of a script (e.g., shapes of letters, joining rules, ligatures, etc.) inside the font itself. The primary fonts that made use of these technologies are Meltho fonts by S. Hasso, 
G. Kiraz, and P. Nelson. Numerous other fonts have become available recently. Yannis Haralambous designed a system called Sabra for the TeX typesetting system, which was used in a few publications.</p>
<p>3. Standards. In February 1998, a proposal was presented to the Unicode Consortium to add Syriac to Unicode, an encoding system for scripts. Syriac became officially part of Unicode 3.0 in 2000. Six Syriac letters for use in Sogdian and Persian were incorporated into Unicode 5.0 in 2007. Syriac letters used for Malayalam Garshuni have not yet been proposed. The name of the Syriac language is also part of ISO 639 where it is designated by ‘Sy’ in the two-letter codes and ‘Syr’ in the three-letter codes.</p>
<p>4. Digitization of mss. and books. The Hill Museum and Manuscript Library (HMML) digitized a few Syriac manuscripts from European libraries in the 1970s as part of a larger digitization project that did not primarily involve Syriac. In 2000 and 2002 Brigham Young University digitized 33 mss. from the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana and published them on a CD ROM. From 2003, HMML began a systematic effort to digitize Syriac collections in the Middle East including the libraries of Balamand, Kaslik (started by BYU), and the monasteries and churches of the Lebanese Maronite Order (ca. 1,000 mss), the Bibliothèque Orientale, Université Saint-Joseph (also started by BYU), <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> (both the Church of the Forty Martyrs and <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>, ca. 1100 mss), <ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref> (ca. 450 mss), <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> (Syr. Orth. and Syr. Cath., ca. 775 mss), and the Missionaires Libanais in Jounieh (ca. 1000 mss). Work is underway in <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref> and Kerala (where Istvan Perzcel initiated a digitization project). Beth Mardutho: The Syriac Institute initiated a digitization project of printed books. The main digitization took place at the ICOR Library of the Catholic University of America in 2004 with BYU as a partner. Beth Mardutho’s collection of ca. 700 books was deposited with HMML. BYU digitized ca. 400 books. Mass digitization projects by Google, Microsoft, and others incidentally contain digital versions of books on Syriac studies.</p>

<Author>G. A. Kiraz</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Coptic Christianity, Syriac contacts with
</LemmaTitle><p>From the earliest period of Christian history, contacts and interaction existed between Egypt and the Syriac world. For some of the Coptic writings of the Nag Hammadi Library, such as the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Philip, the existence of a Syriac original has often been presumed, going back to the 2nd cent. Even if such a Syr. original once existed, it is unclear whether the Coptic translation would have been made directly from Syr. or from a Greek intermediary. For the five Coptic <ref type="cr">Odes of Solomon</ref> that are incorporated in the Gnostic collection known as ‘Pistis Sophia’ (generally dated to the 2nd half of the 3rd cent.), the source language was almost certainly Greek (regardless of whether the Odes were originally written in Greek or Syr.). Some Coptic Manichean texts, however, were translated directly from a (lost) Syr. original, and recent discoveries in the Dakhla oasis have provided fascinating evidence of the immediate coexistence of Coptic and Manichean Syr. (or at any rate an Aramaic dialect, very close to Syr. in both language and script). The Dakhla findings include, among other things, some wooden tablets with a Syr.-Coptic glossary (ed. Franzmann).</p>
<p>Within the Christian Roman Empire, contacts between Christians in Egypt and in Syria and Mesopotamia intensified. Egyptian desert asceticism attracted interest and visits from Syr. Christians, and several writings about the Desert Fathers became known in Syr. as early as the 5th cent. It is very telling that the later Syr. tradition of the <ref type="cr">Life of</ref> <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> lets Ephrem travel to Egypt and spend several years in Scetis, where he met with Bishoi, one of the founders of Coptic monasticism (a legend that lives on in <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> to the present day). This should be seen as part of the process of ‘egyptianization’ of Syr. asceticism (Becker), which tended to minimize or erase the indigenous Syr. roots of asceticism and look for legitimization in the Egyptian tradition of desert asceticism, by giving precedence to texts and persons of Egyptian origin, by re-identifying the authors of existing works as Egyptians, and even by inventing Egyptian founding fathers of asceticism, such as <ref type="cr">Mar Awgen</ref>.</p>
<p>In the development of Christian doctrine, the patriarchates of Alexandria and <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> played an equally important role. Tensions between the two patriarchates, however, came to the fore and formed much of the background against which the Council of Ephesus (431) was held, which was seen as a victory for <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref> over <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>, the latter being associated with Antiochene Christianity. In the wake of the Council, however, reconciliation between Antiochene and Alexandrian bishops took place (433). The subsequent Christological debate brought many Egyptian and Syr. Christians closer together in their rejection of the two-nature formula of the Council of Chalcedon (451), to which they opposed the ‘Miaphysite’ doctrine of the one nature in Christ, in which both the full humanity and full divinity are preserved. While both Egyptian and Syr. Christians were divided between Chalcedonians and anti-Chalcedonians, the latter were able in the course of the 6th cent. to build a church structure that became the foundation for the Miaphysite Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt and for the Miaphysite Syr. Orth. Church in Syria. They did so in defiance of the imperial authorities who, after some hesitation in the late 5th and early 6th cent. resolutely chose for strict adherence to Chalcedon with the accession of Emperor Justin I (518). <ref type="cr">Severus</ref>, since 512 Miaphysite Patr. of Antioch, fled to Egypt in 518, where he not only continued to lead the Syr. Orth. community, but also forged a strong alliance with the Church of Alexandria, arguing that in times of oppression the two Churches needed to act as one. Severus won for himself lasting authority in both the Syr. and the Coptic churches. At his death (538), the Syr. Miaphysites turned for leadership to <ref type="cr">Theodosius</ref>, the exiled Patr. of Alexandria who lived in Constantinople, thus again giving expression to the idea that the Miaphysites in Egypt and in Syria should be united. It was only in the late 550s that attempts were made to reestablish an independent Syr. Orth. patriarch. Towards the end of the 6th cent., a theological dispute broke out between the Egyptian Patr. Damian (569–605) and the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref> (581–91). This was healed only in 616 by Patr. Anastasius of Alexandria (605–16) and the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref type="cr">Athanasios I Gamolo</ref>. By that time both the Syr. and the Coptic Miaphysite churches had fully adopted Severus’s theology as their foundation (rejecting the teachings of <ref type="cr">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref>, which enjoyed a certain degree of popularity throughout the 6th cent.). Although the Coptic and Syr. Miaphysite Churches henceforth existed as separate churches, there was full doctrinal agreement, which opened the way to different ways of contact and interaction. Particularly important was the exchange of a ‘synodical letter’ at the election of a new patriarch, expressing and reaffirming the communion between the two Churches. Throughout the 6th cent. the language of communication between the Alexandrians and Antiochenes was Greek, and the Coptic translations of Severus’s oeuvre are based on the Greek originals, not on the Syr. translations. In the early Islamic period, the language of communication quickly became Arabic, while Syr. and Coptic continued to be used within the individual churches.</p>
<p>The absence of any dogmatic barrier made it possible for Syr. Christians to fully integrate into the Coptic Church. This happened on different levels. On the highest level, four Christians of Syr. origin or descent served as patr. of the Coptic Church (Damian: 579–605; Simon  I: 692–700; Afrahām b. Zurʿa: 975–78; and Murqus b. Zurʿa: 1166–1189), while a fifth Syrian, the monk Samuel, was close to being elected in 1092 (Den Heijer 2004). It is not uncommon in the colophons of Syr. mss. (mostly but not exclusively in those written in Egypt) as well as in Syr. inscriptions to find references to both the Syr. and the Coptic patriarch (Kaufhold). Monks of Syr. origin lived in various monasteries in Egypt, where they sometimes produced Syr. inscriptions, and collected or wrote Syr. mss. Some of these monasteries are explicitly mentioned in colophons of Syr. mss., such as the Monastery of Mar Michael, in Upper Egypt, where ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,582 was produced in 816; an unnamed monastery in the Thebais where in 822/23 the monk Ahron, from Dara, produced ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,623 (reusing a 6th-cent. ms. that contained <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>’s ‘Prose Refutations’); the Monastery of Mar Yonan, from where around the middle of the 9th cent. three monks brought 10 mss. (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,623 being one of them) to <ref type="cr">Dayr</ref> <ref type="cr">al-Suryān</ref>; and the well-known Monastery of St. Paul, near the Red Sea, where ms. Brit. Libr. Or. 5021 was produced at the end of the 9th cent. (Brock 1995). The traditional historiographies of the Coptic and the Syr. Orth. Churches (in particular the Arabic ‘History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria’ and the Syr. Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>) pay much attention to developments in the sister church. Among the Syr. Orth. patriarchs with particular interest and contacts in Egypt, <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> and <ref type="cr">Quryaqos</ref> should be singled out. The Syr. Orth. never set up their own hierarchy in Egypt, even if they had some Syr. churches for their communities (Den Heijer 2004, 935–36).</p>
<p>A clear example of the proximity and the interaction between the two Churches is the creation and millennium-long existence of Dayr al-Suryān. After Syr. Orth. monks (in the first period mainly from <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref>) settled in the monastery in the second decade of the 9th cent., they lived together with Coptic monks. The inscriptions and wall paintings in the monastery clearly attest to the coexistence of the two communities, Syr. and Coptic, and from the 11th cent. onwards the scriptorium produced Coptic and Arabic mss. (along with the Syr. ones, which started being written in the monastery no later than the 10th cent.). While the status of the monastery between the Coptic and Syr. world has received much attention in recent scholarship, the disappearance of the Syr. element in the early 17th cent. should be seen rather as the gradual absorption of the Syr. monks into the mainstream of Coptic life than as a radical linguistic or cultural shift within the monastery’s population (Den Heijer 2004, 937).</p>
<p>While the Syrians’ familiarity with the main theologians of the Alexandrian tradition (such as <ref type="cr">Athanasius</ref>, Cyril, <ref type="cr">Timotheos</ref>, and Theodosius) and with the main texts of Egyptian asceticism was primarily based on Greek texts, there is some evidence of translation work from Coptic into Syriac. A Bohairic Coptic original underlies the extant Syriac Life of Macarius (Toda). Evidence of translation work carried out at the beginning of the 10th cent. by Yuḥanon bar Maqari, the abbot of Dayr al-Suryān, may be found in Syr. ms. Dayr al-Suryān 30. In this ms., partly written by <ref type="cr">Mushe of Nisibis</ref> (the later abbot), Yuḥanon is credited with the translation ‘from the Egyptian tongue into Syriac’ of the Life of the Roman brothers Maximos and Dometios (unpublished) and of the Life of Macarius (ed. P. Bedjan, <i>Acta martyrum et sanctorum</i>, 5 [1895], 177–262). The same Yuḥanon left a note in Coptic in Syr. ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,635 (f. 5r), a ms. with extracts from <ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>, which he helped bind in 894, when he already was abbot. The Syr. impact on the Coptic liturgical tradition is significant. Many Syr. saints were adopted in the Coptic Church: in addition to Severus of Antioch, two major Syr. saints, <ref type="cr">Barṣawmo</ref> and <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>, are represented in the Coptic Synaxarium (Farag) and are depicted in Coptic art; many more are listed in Coptic martyrologia and liturgical calendars (Fiey 1972–1973, 305–10). Some extracts from Ephrem and <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>are preserved in a dogmatic florilegium that may go back to Coptic sources, but is preserved only in Arabic and Ethiopic (Graf 1937). A number of translations from Syriac into Arabic were carried out in Egypt; some of them can be located in Dayr al-Suryān in the 15th–17th cent. (Graf 1951, 23). </p>
<p>While the present overview has focused on the Coptic contacts with the Syr. Orth. Church, E.-Syr. Christians traveled to Egypt as well, either as pilgrims and visitors (e.g., <ref type="cr">Aba I</ref>, <ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref>, and <ref type="cr">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>) or for a longer stay. Around 700, an E.-Syr. bp. is attested for the E.-Syr. diaspora in Egypt, but shortly after his consecration he fell into the hands of Bedouins and was reduced to slavery for the remaining 40 years of his life. Other bps. are attested in the 10th and 11th cent. (Fiey 1972–1973, 338–340). E.-Syr. authors who became popular in the Coptic Church include <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref> and <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref> (‘the spiritual elder’), but their works were translated from Syriac directly into Arabic.</p>
<p>In the 19th cent. a Syr. Catholic hierarchy was set up in Cairo, while a Chaldean diocese, based in Heliopolis, was created in 1980. In the worldwide <ref type="cr">Diaspora</ref> the Coptic and Syr. Orth. communities often work together. The <ref type="cr">British Orthodox Church</ref>, whose episcopal succession was partly Syr. Orth. in origin, was given a home in the Coptic Orth. Church in 1994.</p>
<p>A promising field of study may be the comparative study of the Coptic and Syriac language and syntax, as the two languages developed under similar conditions and were both exposed to the influence of Greek. Among the few features that have received some attention is the Syr. structure (occurring from the early 6th cent. onwards) consisting of the verb <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>bad</i> ‘to do’ followed by the Greek infinitive (e.g. <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>bad filosofise</i> ‘to philosophize’), which parallels, and may be derived from, a similar structure existing in all Coptic dialects except Sahidic, and which consists of the verbal form -<i>er</i> ‘to do’ and a non-conjugated form of the Greek verb (e.g. Bohairic <i>er pisteuin</i> ‘to believe’) (most recently Brock 2004 — for a different explanation, however, see C. A. Ciancaglini, ‘L’origine delle locuzioni verbali con <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>bad</i>in siriaco’, in <i>Loquentes linguis.</i><i>Studi linguistici e orientali in onore di Fabrizio A.

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Crusades 
</LemmaTitle><p>The Crusades were a specific form of Holy War initiated by the pope. The canonical legitimacy of the Crusades was constituted by the papal convocation, the papal indulgences, and the vows taken by the participating knights. For the Syr. Christians the Crusades at the time had simultaneously positive and negative effects. In the long term the Crusades enhanced religious polarization and undermined the position of Christians in Muslim countries.</p>
<p>At the Council of Piacenza, in March 1095, the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (1081–1118) requested Latin military aid against the expanding Muslim forces. With a view of restoring the union of the church and claiming for himself universal ecclesiastical authority, Pope Urban II (1088–99) began to campaign for a war aimed at liberating the Holy Places. He appealed to already existing conceptions of Holy War and developed them into a theory of an armed pilgrimage. At the Council of Clermont-Ferrand, in Nov. 1095, his idea of fighting a war for God met with immense religious enthusiasm. When the knights set out for <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> in 1096, they were joined by pilgrims and ardent non-combatants of different origins. Pope Urban had ignited a formidable movement, which was difficult to control and which resulted in fundamental political, cultural, and economical changes in Europe and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Several vast military campaigns ensued, which were often led by the most powerful crowned heads of Europe. The Crusade of 1096 being the first, the next ones are traditionally counted as the Second Crusade (1145–1149), the Third Crusade (1187–92), the Fourth Crusade (1198–1204), the so-called Children’s Crusade of 1212, the Fifth Crusade (1217–1221), the Crusade of Frederick II (1228–1229) and the Crusades of King Louis  IX the Pious of France (1248–54, 1267–70). In addition, many more military campaigns with papal authorization were waged against Muslims between the 12th and the 15th cent. None of these, however, succeeded in bringing the expansion of the Turks to a halt, nor did they prevent the conquest of Constantinople in 1453. In Europe Crusades were waged against pagan peoples, against heretical movements, as well as against political enemies of the pope. The Reconquista on the Iberian Peninsula also became part of the Crusade movement. Even though criticism flared up against individual wars, the concept of Crusades as well as the ideal of the virtuous knightly Crusader remained strong.</p>
<p>Jerusalem was first captured in the year 1099. Against the wishes of the Byzantine emperor, who had expected the return of the re-conquered regions to his own rule, Latin Crusader States were established in the Levant as a result of the First Crusade (Kingdom of Jerusalem, County of Tripoli, Principality of Antioch, County of Edessa). The ruling French and Norman families by and large implemented the legal traditions of their homelands. Within the Crusader States all non-Latins were legally subordinated. On the local level traditional forms of autonomy and jurisdiction remained intact. The descendents of the first Crusaders developed a new Middle-Eastern identity and specific forms of relations to, as well as agreements with, Eastern Christians and Muslims. These Crusader States, although much reduced toward the coast, were sustained until the year 1291, which saw the fall of Acre.</p>
<p>As for the Christians, the discriminating poll tax under Muslim rule was lifted. The Greek Orthodox hierarchy was forced under the supremacy of a new Latin hierarchy built up in the Crusader states. Local Christians of the Greek Orthodox denomination are known as the ‘Suriani’ in the Latin sources. They made up a considerable part of the Christian population all over the Levant. Albeit speaking Arabic in daily use, they themselves cherished their Syrian or Aramean origin. Their liturgy was byzantinized during the Crusader period.</p>
<p>As the Syr. Orth. were considered heretical by the Latin Church, their hierarchy as well as the hierarchy of the Maronites on the whole was left intact. Almost all the areas of Maronite population fell under Latin rule in the County of Tripoli. Their patriarch resided in monasteries in the Maronite diocese of Jubail. Due to an extreme scarcity of sources, the history of the Maronites in this period is much disputed. The Latin chronicler William of Tyre regarded them as fine warriors and as allies of the Latins.</p>
<p>The Syr. Orth. archdioceses of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, Samosata, Manbij, Tarsus, <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, and Jerusalem, as well as important bishoprics such as Acre, Tripoli, Cyprus, Marʿash, Raban, Kesoun, and Saruj became part of the Crusader states. In the County of Edessa the Syr. Orth. became involved in the Latin administration and also in military action. The capture of Edessa by the Zengid army in 1144 and the failed Latin attempt to regain the city caused much hardship among the Christian population. Massacres and slavery ended a short-lived period of pride and affluence. A spiritual crisis among the Syr. Orth. and theological debates flared up as a consequence.</p>
<p>The Ch. of E. came into contact with the Latins only on its periphery. Under the authority of the metropolitan of the Ch. of E. in <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref> and probably a second metropolitan of Jerusalem and Tripoli, members of this church lived also in Edessa, on Mount Lebanon, in Cyprus, in Antioch, and in the merchant towns on the sea coast. The communities were perhaps also enlarged by refugees, who had moved to the West during the Mongol invasions in Central Asia and Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>The intensity of theological relations between the Eastern Churches and the Latins depended on dogmatic positions as well as on their geographical dispersion and on political constellations. A general climate of theological openness led Eastern Christians and Latins in the 12th and 13th cent. to study each other’s theological propositions and also to seek common ground, with different outcomes. While the union between the Latin and the Greek Church still was officially upheld in the Levant, Latin ecclesiastical supremacy and conflicts alienated the two Churches. During the 12th cent. almost no contacts between the Latins and the Ch. of E. are recorded. At the same time, the most isolated of the Syriac churches during that period, the Maronites, were officially united with the Roman Church. The Maronite patriarch Jeremiah II (1199–1230) was accepted as Primate of the Maronite Church and invited to the 4th Lateran Council in 1215. Some opposition against Latinization however flared up, most notably towards the end of the Latin rule in the Levant.</p>
<p>The Syr. Orth. Church sought a pragmatic understanding without giving up its independence, maintaining contact with the Latins and with the Byzantine Emperor Manuel. At the council of Jerusalem in 1141 the dogmatic differences between Latins, Armenians, and Syr. Orth. were not felt as grave as previously expected. Joint religious practice as well as theological disputations took place. The Syr. Orth. used the advantages of a government that was often unfavorable to the Greek Orthodox. In turn, several instances of direct church governance by the Latins can be detected in which the Latin authorities overruled internal decisions by the Syr. Orth. patriarchs or synods.</p>
<p>During the 13th cent. the Pope intensified his diplomatic and missionary efforts among the Ch. of E. and the Syr. Orth. Church. The generally tolerant attitude of the Mongols towards Christians raised Latin hopes for new allies against the Muslims. The residences of the mendicants in the Crusader States served as bridgeheads for the missions, while the local Latin Church seems to have been little involved. Individual prelates of the Syr. Orth. Church and the Ch. of E. maintained close relations with the Latins. No Syr. source, however, corroborates Roman claims that some Syrian metropolitans or patriarchs recognized Roman primacy at that time. Such claims could be due to a misunderstanding of the Syrian attitudes. Such unions were in any case ephemeral and not supported by the communities.</p>
<p>The frequent wars, their economical effects on local trade and agriculture, roaming bandits, and encroachments on the Eastern Christians caused hardship. Refugees fled to the coast especially after the final Muslim conquest of Edessa in 1146. A slow deterioration of the relations between the Christian and Muslim population is noticeable. Neither Muslims nor Latins sufficiently secured the indigenous population. At the same time for Syriac Christians this was a period of most important achievements in all fields of art and culture, for which the term ‘<ref type="cr">Syriac Renaissance</ref>’ has been often used (see in particular Kawerau 1960 and Teule et al., 2010).</p>

<p>Syriac (and Arabic) scholar. After a period (1834–7) as a sub-librarian in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, he became Assistant Keeper of Manuscripts in the British Museum, where he was in charge of cataloguing Arabic mss. The acquisition, in the early 1840s, of many ancient Syriac mss. from <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in Egypt diverted much of his energy to publishing texts from this very important collection. As a result of his identification of it, one of the two <ref type="cr">Old Syriac</ref>Gospel mss. has been designated as the ‘Curetonianus’. He continued publishing texts from the British Museum after he left it, on his appointment (1849) as Canon of Westminster. Among his most significant publications were the early Syriac versions of Ignatius’s Letters (1845; 1849); <ref type="cr">Athanasius</ref>’s Festal Letters (1848); <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History, Part III (1853); the ‘Curetonianus’ ms. of the Old Syriac Gospels (1858); <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref>’s Palestinian Martyrs (1861); and two collections of shorter texts, <i>Spicilegium Syriacum</i> (1855) and <i>Ancient Syriac Documents</i> (1864), the former of which contains the first edition of the ‘Book of the Laws of the Countries’ attributed to <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>.</p>

<p>Patr. of Alexandria and Greek Church Father. Cyril, who became Patr. in 412, was the leading theologian of the Alexandrine miaphysite christology, and opponent of <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>, Patr. of Constantinople. Many of his works were translated into Syriac; some of these are particularly important since the Greek original is largely lost (this notably applies to the Homilies on Luke). The main Syriac translations that have been published so far are:</p>
<p>1. Homilies on Luke (<i>CPG</i> 5207), ed. R. Payne Smith (1858; ET 1859); first part re-edited by J. B. Chabot (CSCO 70; 1912; LT, R.Tonneau, CSCO 140; 1953). (Incomplete; for some further parts, see A. Vööbus, <i>Discoveries of great import on the Commentary on Luke by Clement of Alexandria</i> [PETSE 24; 1973], and J.-M. Sauget, in <i>SymSyr</i> I, 439–56).</p>
<p>2. To the Emperor, On right faith (<i>CPG</i> 5218), ed. P. E. Pusey (1877), and P. Bedjan, <i>Acta Martyrum et Sanctorum</i>, vol. 5, 628–96. This was probably translated by <ref type="cr">Rabbula of Edessa</ref>.</p>

<p>5. The fragments of Cyril’s work against the Emperor Julian were collected by E. Nestle, in C. J. Neumann, <i>Iuliani ... contra Christianos</i> (1880), 42–87.</p>
<p>The main unpublished translations that survive complete are:</p>
<p>1. Glaphyra (<i>CPG</i> 5201). Only the Prologue, Hom. 1 and parts of VI were published by I. Guidi, <i>Rendiconti, Reale Accademia dei Lincei</i>, 1886, 404–16.</p>

<p>4. Ninth Dialogue, that Christ is One (<i>CPG</i> 5228).</p>
<p>5. Encomium on Mary (<i>CPG</i> 5255).</p>
<p>Large numbers of quotations and excerpts from Cyril feature in <ref type="cr">Severus</ref>’s works, and in the many dogmatic florilegia.

<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> and Greek Church Father. Cyril became bp. ca. 349, but was exiled on various occasions for his opposition to Arianism. Only excerpts from his main work, the Catechetical Homilies, survive in Syriac translation. (Fragments of a complete translation are preserved in <ref type="cr">Christian Palestinian Aramaic</ref>, ed. C. Müller-Kessler and M. Sokoloff, 1999).</p>
<p>Three extracts from the Mystagogical Catecheses (IV.1, 2, 4) are given in the Syr. Catholic <i>Fenqitho</i> (VI., 371–2. 273–4, 376–7) for Corpus Christi.</p>
<p>Syriac translations of two letters are preserved: 
1. on the vision of the Cross, ed. with ET, J. F. Coakley, in <i>AB</i> 102 (1984), 71–84; and 2. on the attempted rebuilding of the Temple in 363, ed. with ET, S. P. Brock, in <i>BSOAS</i> 40 (1977), 267–86 (repr. in <i>Syriac Perspectives on Late Antiquity</i> [1984], ch .X). The second letter probably dates from after Cyril’s death (though Wainwright considers it genuine); its list of towns affected by the earthquake of 363 has proved important for Palestinian archaeology of that period.</p>
<p>A series of short hymns for Good Friday are found in four medieval mss., two of which attribute them to Cyril of Jerusalem (ed. A. Baumstark, in <i>OC</i> III.4 [1930], 232–47); they are also extant in Greek (where they are attributed to <ref type="cr">Sophronius</ref> of Jerusalem [d. 638], or <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, or anonymous), and in Georgian (anonymous).</p>

<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> and Cath, also known as ‘Dadishoʿ the Aramean’. Our main source for Dadishoʿ’s life and work is the report of the Synod of the Ch. of E. held in 424, which is included in the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. In spite of the inauguration of a policy of toleration and freedom for the Church in the Persian Empire under Yazdgard I (r. 399–420), reflected most clearly in the Synod of <ref type="cr">Iṣḥaq</ref> (410), the situation of the Christians again deteriorated towards the end of Yazdgard’s rule, when warfare between the Roman and Persian Empires resumed. After some difficult years, Dadishoʿ was elected Cath. in 421 or 422. From the beginning he was confronted with opposition and accusations within the Church. Imprisoned by the Persian authorities, he was released only after the intervention of a ‘believing envoy’ (apparently from the Roman Empire). This is the background to the Synod of 424, held not in the capital but in ‘Markabta of the Arabs’. Dadishoʿ is quoted at length in the account of the Synod: he reports about his painful experience and is reluctant to resume leadership. The gathered bishops, with bp. Agapetos of <ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>and Hoshaʿ of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> as their main spokesmen, supplicate Dadishoʿ to come back and promise him their full support. He finally consents. His tenure is said to have lasted for 35 years, until his death, but following the Synod of 424 no further information on him is preserved.</p>
<p>A remarkable moment in the Synod is the participating bishops’ decision to abolish what they see as the right of Eastern Christians to lodge complaints against the bp. of Seleucia-Ctesiphon with Western bishops (i.e. bishops within the Roman Empire). Although no such right is recorded in any preserved text, its abolition is presented as a step toward Dadishoʿ’s full rehabilitation. In recent scholarship, this abolition has sometimes been interpreted as a declaration of independence of the Ch. of E. Such an interpretation, however, is based on the assumption that in the earliest period the Ch. of E. was subjected to the authority of the Church within the Roman Empire (or of the bp. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>), whereas such dependence in all likelihood never existed. It remains uncertain, therefore, whether the Synod of 424 and Dadishoʿ’s tenure in fact contributed to the process of alienation between the Syriac Christian communities in the two Empires, which took place in the course of the 5th cent.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Damascus</LemmaTitle> 
<p>Syriac Darmsuq and Arabic Dimashq. City in Syria and the seat at present of the Syr. Orth. Patriarchate. Damascus, situated at the eastern edge of the Syrian Desert at the foot of Mt. Qāsiyūn and watered by the Baradā, has been continuously inhabited at least since the 4th millennium BC and was in 13th–8th centuries BC the seat of an Aramean kingdom. Damascus came under Roman control in 64 BC. Taken by the Arabs in 635, Damascus became the capital of the new empire under the Umayyads. In later periods, Damascus was the most important city in the Bilād al-Shām, an area covering what is today the southern part of Syria, as well as Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan. Under Ottoman rule (1516–1918), Damascus was the capital of the province of al-Shām. Damascus is today the capital of the Syrian Arab Republic, with a population of ca. 1.6 million (2.7 million in the conurbation, in 2008).</p>
<p>Damascus already had followers of Christ at the time of the conversion of St. Paul. Early Miaphysite bishops of Damascus were Mammianus (512–518) and Thomas, the latter exiled under Emperor Justin I in 519. The Maronite chronicle of 664 tells us of two Syr. Orth. bishops Theodoros and Sebokht (i.e. <ref type="cr">Severos Sebokht</ref>) losing in a disputation with the Maronites before the first Umayyad caliph Muʿāwiyya I in Damascus in 659. Bp. Ḥenanyo<ref type="cr"></ref>of Damascus was present at the Syr. Orth. Synod of <ref type="cr">Reshʿayna</ref> in 684. We know the names of a more or less continuous series of Syr. Orth. bishops of Damascus from the beginning of the 9th cent. In 1211, we hear of Bp. Yuḥanon of Damascus serving as an envoy from Patr. Yuḥanon XI (1207/15–20) to the Coptic Pope John VI (1189–1216). In the middle of the 15th cent., the Syr. Orth. see of Damascus is found united with that of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>. Gregory (Cyril) ʿAṭāʾ Allāh, whose activities in India triggered the Coonan Cross Oath of 1653 (see <ref type="cr">Thomas Christians</ref>), was Syr. Orth. Metr. of Damascus and <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref> before his conversion to Catholicism in 1631. In the latter half of the 17th cent. Damascus was the scene of some lively scribal activity centerd around the school of bp. Grigorios Yūḥannā b. al-Ghurayr al-Zurbābī (bp. 1668–84), himself copyist and translator into Arabic of <ref type="cr">Daniel of Ṣalaḥ</ref>’s commentary on the Psalms and, together with his son Sergios, of several works of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>. Among the Syr. Orth. bishops of Damascus in the next century was Grigorios Yūḥannā Niʿmat Allāh al-Ṣadadī (1754–82), the translator of the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael I Rabo</ref> into Arabic in 1759.</p>
<p>The Syr. Orth. patriarchate was transferred from Ḥimṣ to Damascus in 1959 under Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius Yaʿ<ref type="cr">qub  III</ref> (1957–80), who had previously been metr. of <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref> and Damascus since 1950. The Monastery of St. Ephrem in Maʿarrat Ṣaydnāyā (approx. 35 km. north of Damascus), where the Patriarch now usually resides, was opened in 1996.</p>
<p>The Syr. Catholic community in Damascus, which began to gain in numbers towards the end of the 18th cent., has had the future patriarch Shemʿun Zora (Patr. 1814–18) and the scholar <ref type="cr">Clemens Joseph David</ref> (Metr. 1879–90) among its bishops.</p>
<p>The E.-Syr. see of Damascus was erected as a diaspora see in 630. It was made a metropolitan see by <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> at the end of the 8th cent. and is reported to have had <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>, Jerusalem, and Egypt as its suffragans in 1007/8. It is last heard of at the end of the 11th cent.</p>
<p>Fifteen churches were left to the Christians in Damascus after the Arab conquest, among them a ‘Jacobite church’ and a ‘church of the ʿIbād’, i.e. E. Syr. By the time Ibn ʿAsākir (d. 1175) wrote his ‘History of Damascus’, the original ‘Jacobite’ church, located in the southwestern part of the city, was in ruins, the two churches of the ʿIbād that he knew of, both to the east of the Umayyad Mosque, had been converted into mosques, and only two churches were in use, that of St. Mary (<i>Maryamiyya</i>, present Rum Orth. cathedral) and that being used by the Syr. Orth., located to the west of Bāb Tūmā. At the latest from the 17th cent. onwards, Mar<ref type="cr"></ref>Behnam is mentioned as the patron of the W. Syr. church in Damascus.</p>
<p>Damascus is today the residence of Syr. Orth., Melk. Orth. and Melk. Catholic patriarchs, as well as of Syr. Catholic and Maron. archbishops and an Armenian Catholic patriarchal vicar. The Melk. Orthodox constitute the largest Christian group in Damascus, followed by the Melk. Catholics. For the Syriacs, the reported numbers of the faithful in the respective dioceses for Damascus are: Syr. Orth. 25,000 (in 2003), Syr. Catholic 8,000 (in 2006), Maron. 12,000 (in 2006). The area around Bāb Tūmā in the northeastern part of the old city has been the traditional Christian Quarter of Damascus. The Syr. Orth. Patriarchate, with the cathedral church of St. George, is located on the southern part of Bāb Tūmā Street. (There is an older Syr. Orth. chapel of St. George further east, on the north-south street leading to the ‘House of Ananias’). The Maron. cathedral (‘Assumption’ <i>Sayyidat al-intiqāl</i>, also St. Antony) is found just to the north of the Syr. Orth. Patriarchate, while the Syr. Catholic cathedral (St. Paul) lies further south, next to the Melk. Catholic Patriarchate, near Bāb Sharqī.</p>

<p>Bp. of Taḥal (in <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>). <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> attributes several works to him: a ‘Book of flowers’ (<i>Ktābā d-habbābe</i>, possibly an anthology of poetry), funeral sermons, metrical homilies, questions and answers on the text of Scripture, various riddles, a treatise related to the fifth volume of <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref> (even though the attribution of a fifth volume to Isḥaq is problematic, see S. Chialà, <i>Dall’ ascesi</i>, 71–3), and a commentary on <i>reše d-idaʿtā</i> ‘Kephalaia gnostica’ (?). None of these works survive. Of his work on Isḥaq of Niniveh (in which apparently he voiced some criticism of Isḥaq) echoes can be heard in the later tradition, and it was known to <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>. The existence of this work seems to suggest that Daniel lived around, or shortly after, the time of Isḥaq, possibly in the 7th cent. Moreover, Daniel bar Ṭubanitha, with his full name, is mentioned a number of times in the later exegetical tradition, in particular in <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>’s biblical commentaries, even though no title of a specific work is ever provided.</p>
<p>The question arises whether Daniel bar Ṭubanitha might be the same person as <ref type="cr">Daniel bar Maryam</ref> — <i>Ṭubanitha</i> ‘the blessed one’ serving as a synonym for Maryam, the Virgin Mary. This identification, which was first suggested by Chabot, certainly deserves to be considered, but one would have to go against the evidence provided by Ishoʿdad and ʿAbdishoʿ who, as Degen pointed out, clearly saw two distinct Daniels.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Daniel of Mardin</LemmaTitle> <ab type="infobox"/>(1327 – after 1382) [Syr. Orth.]
<p>Author. His father’s name was ʿĪsā. He studied at the Monastery of Noṭpo (outside <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>) where he was ordained priest. In 1356 he went to Egypt and spent 
17 years there. Most of his writings were in Arabic; these include a summary of Syr. Orth. canon law under 
17 headings (listed in Assemani, <i>BibOr</i> II, 463), resumés of various works by <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, and two theological works; he was also the copyist of some of Bar <ref type="cr">ʿ</ref>Ebroyo’s works (Takahashi, 491). His only surviving work in Syriac is an account of how he was interrogated and tortured in March 1382 by the ruler of Mardin, Malik al-Ṭāhir and his vizier, after a book in which he had criticised other religions had fallen into the wrong hands and he was denounced to the authorities. The work survives in an autograph (Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 244, ed. Nau) and in Mingana Syr. 306. His Arabic works sometimes give the author’s name as ‘Daniel ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (or al-Ḥaṭṭāb in Mingana ms. Chr. Ar. 100) of Mardin’; this is usually thought to be a confusion with the Daniel bar Ḥaṭṭāb to whom <ref type="cr">Khamis bar Qardaḥe</ref> addressed a question incorporated into a poem by Bar <ref type="cr">ʿ</ref>Ebroyo (A. Scebabi, <i>Gregorii Hebraei Carmina</i>[1877], 153–4), whence it has been deduced that Daniel bar Khaṭṭāb was a younger contemporary of Bar <ref type="cr">ʿ</ref>Ebroyo. This assumes that the question and answer are not (as would seem more likely) a later interpolation. Since Khamis’s dates are equally uncertain, it is possible that only a single bar Ḥaṭṭāb is involved; if this is the case, then Daniel bar Ḥaṭṭāb of Mardin provides a 14th-century date for Khamis, rather than 13th. Daniel of Mardin should be distinguished from the ‘Malphono Daniel’ known from an Esṭrangela epitaph probably dated 1172/3, published by J. Jarry (‘Un écrivain syriaque inconnu du Tur ‘Abdin’, <i>Syria</i>52 [1975] 131–7; on which see A. N. Palmer, in <i>OC</i>71 [1987], 85–7).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Daniel of Ṣalaḥ</head><ab type="infobox"/>(fl. mid-6th cent.) [Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Biblical exegete, theologian, abbot and possibly bp. Although he is one of the most influential Syr. Orth. writers, none of Daniel’s writings have been fully edited, and the little that is known about his life is almost entirely dependent upon these texts. In a homily (on Ps. 83) in the middle of his best known work, and the only one at present thought to have been preserved in its entirety, his ‘Great Commentary on the Psalms’, he gives the current date as year of the Greeks 853, i.e. AD 542. Since J. S. Assemani erroneously identified him with a Daniel known to have corresponded with <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> in the 8th cent., it should be emphasised that a 6th-cent. date is confirmed by Daniel’s theological concerns, his references to contemporary historical events (such as the incursions and raids of the Blemmyes, Sabirai, and Antai), and by the prefixed correspondence in which Daniel is requested to write the commentary by Abbot Yuḥanon of the monastery of Mor Eusebios of Kaprā d-Bartā (or d-Birtā) northwest of <ref type="cr">Apamea</ref> (the modern twin villages of Kefr and Bara). Abbot Yuḥanon is listed in the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> (IX.14) amongst those condemned for their opposition to Chalcedon by the emperor Justinian. It appears to be the same Yuḥanon (described as ‘a wall against wolves’) for whom a copy of the Acts of the Second Council of Ephesus was produced by one of his monks in 535 (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,530). By 567, however, Yuḥanon had disappeared from the scene, for one Qustantinos is listed as abbot of this important monastery.</p>
<p>Assemani also linked Daniel with the village of Ṣalaḥ in <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> (southeast Turkey), and this has been followed by all subsequent western scholars. In the present Syr. Orth. monastery of Ṣalaḥ, however, this prestigious connection is rejected, as also by the Syr. Orth. scholar and Patr. Ignatius Afram Barsoum who instead links Daniel to Ṣaliḥiye (near modern Abū Kāmāl in Syria) on the left bank of the Euphrates just south of ancient <ref type="cr">Dura-Europos</ref>. Some support for this can be found in the Chronicle of Michael who describes him as Abbot Daniel of Bayt Ṣaliḥe (IX.34), although the exact name and location of his monastery is not given. Later tradition also links Daniel with Tella d-Mawzelat (ancient Constantina, modern Viranşehir south-west of Diyarbakır, Turkey), although in some sources he is said to have been born there and in others to have become its bishop, as a successor to the famous <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Tella</ref> (d. 538). Although Daniel was certainly a leading figure in the anti-Chalcedonian party he is not listed amongst those bps. ordained by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref>, and neither has any later reference to his episcopacy yet been found in any source other than the mss. of his Psalm Commentary.</p>
<p>Daniel’s Psalm Commentary is a vast work of erudition and spirituality, and appears to be the oldest known psalm commentary composed in Syriac. It runs to more than 1,000 ms. pages and is divided into three volumes each containing fifty psalms. Although it was long thought by western scholars to have been only partially preserved, it has in fact continued to be read and studied in the Syr. Orth. church to the present day, and so their complete mss. now make a critical edition of this important work possible.</p>
<p>The commentary acts as a great storehouse of Syr. Orth. exegetical traditions and theology and preserves both ideas known from earlier Syrian writers such as <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> and <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, but also many others previously unknown. It does not appear to be dependent on any previous commentary, although there is evidence that Daniel knew Greek and even had some access to Hebrew texts and traditions. As with Ephrem’s commentary on the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref> no attempt is made to expound every line or word of the Psalms, but only those which attract the author’s attention. The exegesis is also structured in the form of self-contained homilies, which makes them suitable for either private or communal reading — in contrast, for example, with the technical, philological commentary of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>. Although Daniel often attempts to identify the historical occasions of the Psalms’ composition, he usually moves quickly on to expound their spirit-inspired references to the divine dispensation personified in Emmanuel, God the Word. He regularly engages with christological issues, and he is especially concerned to counter the teachings of <ref type="cr">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref> and his followers, often known as the ‘Phantasiasts’ or ‘Aphthartodocetae’, which were creating bitter dissension in his age within both Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian parties. He clearly developed a reputation for expertise in this area since his letter to the monks of the monastery of Mar Bassus on the subject formed the basis of the official Syr. Orth. response to the edict of Emperor Justinian, issued in 565, that ‘all bishops everywhere’ should accept Julianism (Michael’s Chronicle, IX.34), and this may have been one of the key reasons that Abbot Yuḥanon requested him to write this commentary.</p>
<p>Its great size has led to at least four major attempts to reduce it to a manageable format; the best known of these is an edition (produced before 1515) of approximately 250 pages which is usually described as the commentary of ‘Daniel (or David) of Tella’, and which also includes some material and interpretation not found in the original work, and to this can be added a collection of short extracts, plus editions by Patr. Ignatius V (<ref type="cr">Behnam Ḥadloyo</ref>, d. 1454) and by <ref type="cr">Dawid Puniqoyo</ref> (d. 1500), none of which has yet been published. It is also cited by the monk <ref type="cr">Severos</ref>, <ref type="cr">Anṭun of Tagrit</ref>, and Bar ʿEbroyo, and was one of the major sources for the psalm commentary of <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>. An important Armenian translation was commissioned by Catholicos Grigor Vkayaser in the late 11th cent., and an Arabic version was made in 1730 by ʿAbd al-Nūr Amīdī.</p>
<p>In addition to the Great Psalm Commentary, and the letter written to the monks of Mar Bassus (elements of which may survive in the large unedited collections of anti-Julianist material still preserved in the mss. of the British Library and the Vatican), citations of a commentary on Qohelet (Ecclesiastes) have also been preserved, and Daniel himself (in his homily on Ps. 78) refers to an earlier homily on the plagues which afflicted the Egyptians in the time of Moses. Complete texts of these writings are not yet known, but it is to hoped that the publication of the Psalm Commentary will encourage others to look for copies in the great Syr. Orth. libraries and in the ms. collections of the west.</p>

<p>Author. Born in Beth Shahaq, in the region of <ref type="cr">Nineveh</ref>, he was abbot of the monastery of Mor Sargis, on the Dry Mountain in Sinjar. A marginal note to Dolabani no. 2, states that in 785 (cf. Mingana Syr. 29 for the year) he temporarily moved with others to a monastery on the Euphrates (evidently <ref type="cr">Qenneshre</ref>) and later brought back 170 <i>maʿnyoto</i> of <ref type="cr">Severus</ref>, adapting them for liturgical use in the east. The texts published by Dolabani are mainly letters, prose, and verse, in a learned style, to named correspondents; of particular interest are no.  6, on the authorship of Wisdom (Maccabean date), and no. 14 (LT in Rahmani, 44–6), on points in biblical mss., with reference to several scholars. At the end are two longer poems, on the 7 <i>klimata</i> (also ed. by Cardahi and Gottheil from different mss), and one on the trees and plants and their symbolism (the first part is given in <i>Qolo Suryoyo</i> 56 [1987], 153–49). He is also author of some short grammatical works (partial ed. Gottheil), a poem on the alphabet (ed. Gottheil), a commentary on Genesis 10 (in ms. British Libr. Add. 14,620; incomplete) and a dialogue with a Melkite on the Trisagion (excerpt in <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 1, 518–9). The attribution to him of the 22 short poems (forming an alphabetic acrostic) published by Qarabashi cannot be correct: each poem contains only a single example of its opening letter, a type of composition, as Barsoum points out, which does not otherwise appear till the 13th cent.</p>

(ca. 1431 – ca. 1500) [Syr. Orth.]
<p>Priest, author, and poet. Based on ms. colophons and an extant correspondence with Patr.<ref type="cr"> Nuḥ the Lebanese</ref>, it is known that Dawid lived in the latter half of the 15th cent. According to traditional biographical sources, he was born Dawid b. ʿAbd al-Karīm b. Ṣalāḥ in al-Qaryatayn in 1431. At a young age, he moved to <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref>, from which his sobriquet Puniqoyo (= of Ḥimṣ) derives. He became a monk and later a deacon at <ref type="cr">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>. In 1459, he went to <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> where he was ordained a priest. He then proceeded to <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Ṣalīb</ref> and in 1481 traveled to Constantinople. Dawid is one of the most prominent Syriac authors of the 15th cent. His prose works include an autobiography up to the middle of his life and a biographical piece on <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref>. In addition, he wrote a commentary on Psalms that incorporates material from various commentaries, especially those by <ref type="cr">Daniel of Ṣalaḥ</ref>, <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>. Dawid also composed a number of poetic works, some of which employ rhyme and/or are acrostics. These include <i>mimre</i>entitled ‘On Repentance’, ‘On Spiritual Life’, and ‘On the Afflictions of Exile’ (ed. with ET Butts). In addition to <i>mimre</i>, he wrote a <i>sedro</i>on resurrection and a number of liturgical poems. Despite his prolific literary activity, most of the works by Dawid remain unedited.</p>

<LemmaTitle>De’ Rossi, Azariah (Buonaiuto)</head><ab type="infobox"/> ʿAzariah ben Moshe min Haʾadumim (ca. 1511 – ca. 1577)
<p>Jewish Italian physician; biblical scholar and polymath; author of a treatise about the usefulness of the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> for the evaluation of the Vulgate of the NT. Little is known about his childhood and early education. After leaving his birth town, Mantua, he wandered to several Italian cities, living for some time in Ferrara, Ancona, Bologna, and Sabbioneta. His best known work, <i>Me</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>or ʿenayim</i> (‘Light of the Eyes’, Mantua, 1573), incited controversy among Jewish scholars, especially because of its critique of the historical reliability of the Talmud, but it earned him the appreciation of several Christian Hebraists. Ill, impoverished, and ostracized by many of his fellow Rabbis, De’ Rossi began to attempt to appeal to a Christian audience. His <i>Osservazioni di Buonaiuto de’ Rossi ebreo sopra diversi luoghi degli Evangelisti novamente esposti secondo la vera lezione siriaca</i> (‘Observations of Bonaiuto de’ Rossi the Jew regarding various passages in the Gospels expounded anew according to the true Syriac reading’), written in Italian, is dedicated to Giacomo Boncompagni, Captain General of the Catholic Church, and opens with a letter to cardinal Giulio Antonio Santoro, head of the Collegio dei Neofiti and a figure much involved in the attempts at achieving the ‘reunification’ with the Churches of the East (he supervised the translation of the Syr. Orth. missal). The book, composed in Ferrara between 1575 and 1577, must be read against the backdrop of the debate about the trustworthiness of the Vulgate that had followed the declaration of its authenticity on the part of the Council of Trent (1546). In this work, De’ Rossi set out to show that, thanks to its superiority, the NT Peshitta (published for the first time by Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter and <ref type="cr">Mushe of Mardin</ref> in 1555) could shed light upon corrupt or obscure passages of the NT Vulgate, especially those in which Aramaic expressions appear. In order to prove his point De’ Rossi expounded seventeen passages from the Gospels containing Aramaic words, citing each passage first in the Latin version of the Vulgate; then in Syriac (in Serṭo script and in cursive Hebrew and Latin transcription); and finally in his own Italian translation. De’ Rossi employed <ref type="cr">Teseo</ref> <ref type="cr">Ambrogio degli Albonesi</ref>’s <i>Introductio</i> as his main tool for learning Syriac, which like many of his contemporaries he considered just a different alphabet for writing Aramaic, but he also seems to have made use of Widmanstetter’s <i>Elementa</i>.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Denḥa</LemmaTitle> <ab type="infobox"/>(9th cent.?) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>Author of a commentary on the Psalms. On the basis of remarks by <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref>, Wright and Baumstark identify Denḥa as a disciple of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref>, placing him in the first half of the 9th cent. His only extant work is a commentary on the Psalms, which along with the commentary by <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> is an important witness to E.-Syr. interpretation of the Psalms. The earliest ms. of the commentary, Paris Bib. Nat. Syr. 367 (dated 1252; formerly Siirt 29), identifies two authors: ‘Rabban Denḥa, but others say Rabban Grigor, monk of Gamre.’ This double attribution, found in all the extant mss., seems to refer to a new edition of Denḥa’s commentary by the monk Grigor of Gamre, who is otherwise unknown, with the additions having been made in red ink. Van Rompay has shown that the Denḥa-Grigor commentary is in fact an expanded form of the anonymous Psalm commentary found in ms. Sachau 215 (dated 1882), both commentaries preserving elements of the exegesis of the Psalms by <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. The Denḥa-Grigor commentary was supplemented by material ascribed to <ref type="cr">Aḥob Qaṭraya</ref> and has been preserved in mss. that incorporate, in whole or in part, other works on the Psalms, notably a Book on the Cause of the Psalms of Mar Aḥob Qaṭraya, an introduction to the Psalms by <ref type="cr">Nathniel of Sirzor</ref> (ca. 600), and one of Isho<LemmaTitle>ʿ</LemmaTitle> bar Nun’s ‘Selected Questions’ (dealing with Ps. 119). The commentary appears to have been popular in the E.-Syr. tradition and is found in a number of 19th-cent. mss. (e.g., ms. Mingana Syr. 58 and ms. Cambridge Univ. Libr. Or. 1318). Echoes of the Denḥa-Grigor commentary are found in W.-Syr. commentaries on the Psalms by <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> (factual commentary) and <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref><LemmaTitle>.</LemmaTitle>A  few extracts of the Denḥa-Grigor commentary dealing with messianism have been published by Vandenhoff.</p>

<Author>S. D. Ryan</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Diamper, Synod of</head><ab type="infobox"/>(20–27 June 1599) 
<p>Diocesan synod of the <ref type="cr">Thomas Christians</ref>, or the Syriac-rite Christians of Kerala, held in the village of Udayamperur (Diamper) to the south of Kochi (Cochin). It marked a watershed in the process of strengthening Roman and Portuguese control over the Thomas Christians.</p>
<p>Prior to the Synod of Diamper, the Thomas Christians had been ruled by E. Syr. and, since the middle of the 16th cent. — after the recognition of Patr. <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref> by Rome in 1553 and the arrival of his brother Mar Yawsep in Kerala in 1558 — by Chald. bishops. At the same time, the second half of the 16th cent. had seen an increase in the activities of Latin missionaries in Kerala and moves by the Portuguese to strengthen their control over the Thomas Christians, who were indispensable for them as partners in the spice trade, with the result, for example, that the Chald. bp. Mar Abraham, who had arrived in India in 1568, was summoned in 1585 to attend the Third Provincial Council of Goa and was made to agree to the introduction of a number of Latin practices in the liturgy of the Thomas Christians.</p>
<p>Following the death of Mar Abraham in 1597, Archbishop Aleixo (Alexis) de Menezes of Goa (1559–1617, Archbishop of Goa 1595–1612) arrived in Kerala in Jan. 1599. After gaining the support of the local rulers and some of the local clergy, partly by ordaining a large number of new priests, and forcing Archdeacon George of the Cross (archdeacon 1594–1640), the leader of the Thomas Christians, to submit to him, Menezes called for a synod to be convened in June 1599. Udayamperur, more easily accessible from the Portuguese stronghold at Kochi than the traditional center of the diocese at Angamali, was chosen as the venue of the synod.</p>
<p>The synod, attended by 153 local priests and 660 lay representatives, lasted from the 20th to the 27th of June, and passed more than 200 decrees in rapid succession and evidently without any serious debate. The decrees covering doctrinal, liturgical, and customary matters were designed to bring the Church of the Thomas Christians in line with the post-Tridentine 
Roman Church, as well as to sever her links with the 
E.-Syr. (Chald.) Church, and included condemnations of ‘Nestorian’ heresy and prohibition of any recognition of the ‘Patriarch of ­Babylon’.</p>
<p>The Jesuit Francisco Ros (Roz), writing in 1604, reported that Menezes had altered the text of the acts and decrees of the synod which he sent to Rome after the synod had ended, and there are indeed significant differences between the Malayalam text of the decrees and the text which was made known in Europe, although we cannot be sure that the Malayalam text we have today, preserved only in 18th-cent. mss., faithfully represents the decrees as read out and passed at the synod. Serious doubts have also been cast on the canonical validity of the synod itself by scholars including J. Thaliath. Valid or not, however, the synod and its decrees, the latter somewhat modified at the diocesan synod of 1603 and by the so-called Rozian Statutes of 1606, were to determine the way of life and the course of events for the Thomas Christians, especially those who remained in communion with Rome, in the subsequent centuries.</p>
<p>After the synod, Menezes remained in Kerala until Nov. 1599 and made a tour of the diocese, during which books preserved in the local churches were submitted to his entourage for examination and those deemed heretical were consigned to the flame. It is believed that a large proportion of those Syriac mss. which were in Kerala at the time were lost in this way, although it is difficult now to determine the exact extent of the loss.</p>
<p>In Dec. 1599, Ros was appointed new bp. of the diocese of Angamali, which was now formally placed under the Portuguese Padroado and made suffragan to the archdiocese of Goa, although it regained its archiepiscopal status in name in 1608 (the see was transferred around the same time to Kodungallur/Cranganore). Ros was followed by a succession of Jesuit archbishops. The dissatisfaction of the Thomas Christians with their rule was to lead to the revolt against them at the Coonan Cross Oath of 1653 and the subsequent division of the Thomas Christians between those who remained in communion with Rome and those who turned to the Syr. Orth. Church.</p>
<p>On the different texts of the decrees of the synod, see Thaliath, <i>The Synod of Diamper</i>, 175–216. The English translation of the decrees by Michael Geddes, based on the Portuguese version and first published in 1694, has often been reprinted, e.g. in J.

<Author>H. Takahashi</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Diaspora
</LemmaTitle><p>Prior to the late 19th cent. there had been very little emigration from the Middle East, whereas today there are more Christians from the Syriac (and other Middle Eastern) Churches living in the Diaspora than remain in the homelands. The two main causes of this massive demographic change are 1. the massacres in Syria and Lebanon of 1860, and especially those in Eastern Turkey of 1895/6 and of 1915 (see <ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref>) and following years; and 2. the continuing unsettled political situation, involving wars and civil strife, in many countries of the Middle East, where certain events in particular have given rise to renewed waves of emigration, notably in 1933 after the end of the British Mandate in Iraq (1932), involving the Assyrians; the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and the three subsequent wars (1956, 1967, 1973), involving the Syr. Orth. in Palestine; the Lebanese civil war (1975–1990), involving the Maronites and other Syr. communities in Lebanon; the Turkish-Kurdish conflict in Eastern Turkey, involving mainly the Syr. Orth.; the Iraqi-Kurdish conflict, followed by the Iraq-Iran war (1980–88), the Gulf war (1990–1), and the invasion of Iraq (2003), involving the Chaldeans, Assyrians, Syr. Catholic, and Syr. Orth. In all these upheavals displacement and emigration has also been to other countries within the Middle East (or even within the same country), as well as to countries outside it (with or without refugee status). 
A further cause of emigration has been the lack of educational or employment opportunities in the countries of origin; this had already led to the earliest immigration to the United States (<ref type="cr">Chicago</ref>, New Britain, CT) from north-west Iran (<ref type="cr">Urmia</ref> region) in the late 19th cent.</p>
<p>The massacres of 1895/6 and 1915–18 led to large scale emigration, both within the Middle East (mainly to Syria, Lebanon, Palestine in the case of the Syr. Orth.; to Iraq, Iran, and the Caucasus [and thence, to Russia] in the case of the Chaldeans and Assyrians) and to the West, above all at this stage to the Americas, both North and South. The flight of Assyrians from Iraq in 1933 resulted in new settlements in eastern Syria, while others emigrated to Britain and especially the United States. The Americas were also the goal of most of those emigrating after the creation of Israel, and it has only been in the last 50 years that large numbers from all the Syr. Churches have emigrated to countries of western Europe, with a preponderance of Syr. Orth. settling in Germany (where the first priest was ordained in 1977) and Sweden, and of Chaldeans and Maronites in France. An important development in the case of the Syr. Orth. was the founding of three monasteries by the late bp. <ref type="cr">Julius Çiçek</ref> (Mor Ephrem, Netherlands, 1984; Mor Augen, Switzerland, 1999; Mor Yaʿqub da-Srug, Germany, 2000). Smaller communities from the different Syr. Churches are also found in Russia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Britain, and Greece. More recently emigration on a large scale has also been to Australia. A pattern followed in many cases has been for emigrés from a particular village to settle together in their new home. Since 2003 it has been Syria, Jordan, and Turkey that have been the immediate goals of those fleeing from the dangerous situation in Iraq.</p>
<p>The increasing sizes of the Diaspora communities has led to the creation of new dioceses outside the Middle East, following on from the earlier establishment of church communities in the different countries. The main topic of the 16th Congress of Catholic Patriarchs of the Middle East in 2006 was emigration. The following listing of Diaspora dioceses gives some idea of the geographical spread for each of the Syr. Churches; figures for numbers, where given, are inevitably only approximate (these can vary considerably from one source to another).</p>
<p><i>Ancient Church of the East</i>: Germany (Mainz), Western USA (Modesto, California), and Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p><i>Assyrian Church of the East</i>: Europe (Norsborg, Sweden); Canada (Weston, Ontario); Eastern USA (Chicago; residence of the Patr.), Western USA (Glendale, Arizona); Western California (San Jose); Australia and New Zealand (Sydney). With communities in several other countries, including Denmark, Germany, Great Britian, Greece, and Russia. Whereas some 150,000 now live in the Diaspora (ca. 90,000 in USA, and 10,000 in Australia/New Zealand), only ca. 100,000 remain in the Middle East.</p>
<p><i>Chaldean Catholic Church</i>: USA (Southfield, Michigan; San Diego [since 2002]), with ca. 170,000 faithful; Australia and New Zealand (since 2006), with ca. 15,000. There are sizeable communities in Canada (Montreal, Toronto, Windsor), and in Europe (especially France, with communities in Paris, Lyon, and Marseille; but also Sweden, Germany, Belgium, and smaller ones in Greece, Netherlands, Denmark, and Great Britain).</p>
<p><i>Maronite Church</i>: USA (Brooklyn, Los Angeles); Canada (Montreal); Brazil (Sao Paolo); Argentina (Buenos Aires [since 1990]); Mexico (since 1995); Australia (Strathfield, NSW); and sizeable communities in Europe, especially France. Estimates ranging between one million and two and a half million are given for Maronites in the Diaspora (a high proportion are in South America), while little over half a million remain in the Middle East.</p>
<p><i>Syrian Catholic Church</i>: USA (Newark NJ [since 1995]) and Venezuela (since 2001); with communities in in USA in Detroit, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Jacksonville (Florida). In Canada there are communities in Toronto and Montreal; in Europe, notably in Amsterdam, London, and Paris; in Australia, in Sydney. An estimated 50,000 (out of a total of ca. 100,000) live in the Diaspora.</p>
<p><i>Syrian Orthodox Church</i>: Europe: Sweden and Scandinavia (Södertälje and Klockarvägen); Germany (Warburg); Netherlands (Glane); Belgium (Brussels); Great Britain (London); with further communities in France, Switzerland, Italy, and Austria; USA (Teaneck, New Jersey; Burbank, California); Canada (Saint Laurent, Québec); Australia and New Zealand (Lidcombe, NSW); Argentina (La Plata). Some 150,000 live in the Diaspora, while roughly the same number remain in the Middle East (by far the largest numbers are in India).</p>
<p>The different Indian Churches of Syr. tradition also have considerable diasporas all over the world, and several now have a North American diocese (Syro-Malabar: Chicago, since 2001; Syro-Malankara: for America and Europe, since 2005; Syrian Orthodox: Cartaret, New Jersey; Orthodox Syrian: Alma, Michigan, and Belrose, New York). There are communities in several European countries from all the Syr. Churches in India (especially Great Britain, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria). Many from Kerala go as temporary workers to the Gulf states, in some of which churches have been built.</p>
<p>The above locations only cover countries where church communities have been established; for individuals from the Syr. Churches of the Middle East, the scatter is much wider, and includes countries of Africa and East Asia.<i></p>
</i><p>The move to secular societies where ethnic and cultural, rather than religious, identity is paramount has caused much dispute in the search for appropriate names to use (Aramaean, Assyrian, Chaldean, Assyro-Chaldean, Syriac, <i>Suryoyo</i>, etc.), and the issue has often proved sadly divisive, especially among the Syr. Orth. On the other hand, many new opportunities have been opened up, for the creation of cultural and other associations, and for new educational possibilities. In the 1930s when for a time it was Soviet policy to encourage minority languages, the written use of Modern Syriac (in Latin script) was encouraged; a more recent adaptation of the spoken language to western script has taken place with <ref type="cr">Turoyo</ref> in Sweden. Especially important has been the freedom to publish in western countries. This has given rise to a great many cultural magazines, often multilingual (and including both Classical and Modern Syriac), as well as the creation of television channels (such as Suryoyo SAT, Suroyo TV, Assyrian TV); it has also made it possible to publish information about <i>Sayfo</i>. Another notable development has been in the creation of music groups, both church-based and secular, the latter using lyrics in both Classical and Modern Syriac; though this development had its origins in the Middle East (e.g. ­Qamishli in the 1960s, and rather earlier in Iran), it has been greatly developed in the Diaspora.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Diatessaron 
</LemmaTitle><p>Title of a Gospel harmony composed in the 2nd cent.; the first-known Gospel translation into Syriac. The title is Greek, meaning ‘through [the] four [Gospels]’. In the Syriac world it was known either by its transliterated Greek name (<i>diyaṭessaron</i>) or as the <i>ewangeliyon da-mḥallṭe</i> (‘Gospel of the mixed’, as contrasted with the <i>ewangeliyon da-mparrše</i>, ‘Gospel of the separated’). The Diatessaron occupied a preeminent position in the Syrian Church in the first four centuries. <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref> often appears to cite the Gospels in the form of the Diatessaron. <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> composed his Commentary on the Diatessaron. The Syrian-born hymnographer <ref type="cr">Romanos the Melodist</ref> quotes its text in his Greek hymns. Later commentators and writers (e.g., <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, <ref type="cr">Dionysios</ref> <ref type="cr">bar Ṣalibi</ref>, <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>) all speak of it with great respect. Bar Brikha even imputes to Tatian an almost mystical grasp of the ‘intention’ of the evangelists, enabling him to accurately harmonize the Gospels without loosing or distorting anything. The evidence of the <ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref> and bp. <ref type="cr">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref> (‘Compendium of Heretical Fables’, I.20) are proof of the Diatessaron’s ecclesiastical, liturgical use into the early 5th cent. Theodoret reports he confiscated ‘more than 200 copies in reverential use in the churches of our diocese’, and replaced the Diatessaron with the four separate Gospels (<i>ewangeliyon da-mparrš</i><i>e</i>). And it must be assumed that Canon 43 of Bp. <ref type="cr">Rabbula of Edessa</ref>, which requires the use of the <i>ewangeliyon da-mparrše</i> in churches, is also directed against the Diatessaron. Eventually the Diatessaron was replaced by the <ref type="cr">Old Syriac</ref> <ref type="cr">Version</ref> of the separate Gospels and, eventually, the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>. Even in these, however, the Diatessaron’s influence is discernable in specific harmonizations and turns of phrase.</p>
<p>Although the origin of the Diatessaron is enshrouded in darkness, it was most likely compiled by <ref type="cr">Tatian</ref>, the author of an ‘Oration to the Greeks’ (preserved in Greek) who describes himself as an ‘Assyrian’ (the exact geographical meaning of which is debated: either Mesopotamia or Syria). After sampling many philosophies in the mid–2nd cent., he converted to Christianity and ended up in Rome where he studied under Justin Martyr. It seems that Justin was already using a Gospel harmony, apparently based on the synoptic Gospels. After Justin’s death (between 163 and 167), Tatian ran afoul of the Roman congregation. <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref> says that he was expelled from the Roman congregation in 172. After that we have only a report of <ref type="cr">Epiphanius</ref>, stating that he returned to the East, where he founded a school. Given this history, it seems unlikely that Tatian would have created the Diatessaron while Justin (with whom he seems to have had good relations) was alive. Similarly, since no Greek (‘Western’) source speaks of the Diatessaron prior to Eusebius (and Eusebius was an Easterner in practice, and wrote in the East), it seems unlikely that the Diatessaron was composed in Rome. Rather, it is more likely to have been composed on the way back to the East, or in the East, shortly after 172. Evidence suggests that the Diatessaron was composed in <ref type="cr">Syriac</ref> (see below). If correct, this too would favour composition in the East (but it should not be interpreted as precluding composition in the West, for Syriac was used in Rome in the 2nd cent.). While the use of the Diatessaron in early Syriac Christianity presupposes an early date for its composition, Tatian’s authorship is not explicitly mentioned in any of the early Syriac sources. Not surprisingly, therefore, his authorship has been questioned in recent research (Koltun-Fromm).</p>
<p>A Gospel harmony is a complicated creation. It seeks, by acute literary skill, to conflate parallel accounts. Duplications are excised, conflicts are resolved, and nothing of importance is lost. Various reasons for Tatian’s efforts have been suggested; none, on its own, is convincing, and the reality probably lies in a combination of motives. First, in his only other surviving literary work, his ‘Oration to the Greeks’, Tatian emphasizes the unity of truth. Four canonical Gospels as well as numerous extra-canonical Gospels do not present a ‘unity’ which, for Tatian, was the hallmark of truth. Here, then, one can discern a motive for creating a single, harmonized account. Second, the contradictions and inconsistencies in the Gospels had led critics such as Celsus to ridicule Christianity. One way to resolve these problems was Marcion’s: to select one gospel and exclude all others. But the same problem may also be solved as Tatian did: create one Gospel — a harmony — out of the many. A third motive may simply have been the spirit of the times. Tatian’s teacher Justin used a harmony, and other harmonies circulated in the early Church. In other words, Tatian may simply have been doing what others were doing. Fourth, the 2nd-cent. view of the task of an historian was to sift through the sometimes contradictory individual accounts of an event and then, through the exercise of sound historical judgement, write the single definitive account. According to this view, Tatian saw himself as an historian; the Gospels were ‘raw material’ for an historian; the Diatessaron was therefore a scholarly work of a ‘professional’ historian.</p>
<p>The Diatessaron is extremely important for recovering the oldest text of the Gospels. It is obvious that Tatian, when composing his harmony, had to use the Gospels in the form they had in the mid-2nd cent. He also, apparently, availed himself of Justin’s already-extant harmony of the synoptic Gospels, augmenting it with material from the Gospel of John and then recasting its sequence. Therefore, the Diatessaron preserves numerous ancient deviating readings — that is, readings which deviate from modern critical editions of the Gospels, but which agree with other 2nd cent. sources (such as the Jewish-Christian Gospel fragments, the ‘Gospel of Thomas’, Justin, etc.). This means that when he composed the Diatessaron, Tatian either used (proto-) canonical Gospels whose text contained readings now found only in the Jewish-Christian Gospels, or that, in addition to the canonical Gospels, he also used extra-canonical sources, including one or more Jewish-Christian Gospels.</p>
<p>Today no direct copies of the Diatessaron survive. Its text must be reconstructed through a painstaking collation and comparison of numerous ‘witnesses’ to the Diatessaron: an assortment of translations (into both Eastern and Western languages) and patristic quotations. These include translations (sometimes heavily revised) into Arabic, Latin, Old Italian, Old High German, Middle Dutch, Middle High German, Middle English, and other languages. A Persian harmony also exists, but its sequence is very different from that of the Diatessaron, even though in many individual variants it seems to agree with the Diatessaron. It should be noted that a gospel harmony has two distinctive features which can be used for identification: 1. the sequence of harmonization, and 2. the individual variant readings within a verse.</p>
<p>The Diatessaron’s influence was not limited to Syria, but extended to other areas, both Eastern and Western. It is thought that the Gospels first appeared in Armenian in the form of a translation of the Diatessaron, and it influenced the translation of the separate Gospels into Georgian. We even find its distinctive readings in the Manichaean texts written in Parthian and found at Turfan, in China. In the West, the oldest known translation of the Gospels into Middle Dutch is a Gospel harmony (known as ‘the Liège Harmony’) related to the Diatessaron; and while not the oldest Gospel translation into Old High German (that honour goes to a few fragments at a cloister in Monsee, Austria), a Gospel harmony related to the Diatessaron, Codex Sangallensis, is the oldest <i>complete</i> Gospel text in Old High German.</p>
<p>It is on the basis of these Western witnesses to the Diatessaron that one can reach a judgement about its original language. The presence of Syriacisms or Semitisms in these ‘Western’ witnesses to the Diatessaron can only be explained by presuming that their archetype was a document composed in a Semitic language, not Greek or Latin.</p>
<p>Because of the Diatessaron’s paramount importance for both the text and canon of the NT, much scholarly effort has gone into reconstructing its text. Equally important, however, is its position as the oldest of the versions, a translation and rearrangement of the Gospels that had world-wide impact, from England to China.</p>

<p>Bp., writer and educator. He was born on 8 Nov. 1833 in Ras Keifa, and was raised in Kfar Zina, near Tripoli. He studied at the College at ʿAyn Warqa, a successor to the Maronite College in Rome since 1789. He established in 1851 a school in Tripoli where he taught Arabic until 1852. He was ordained priest in 1855, and taught (1855–
1860) at Mar Yuḥanna Marun school in Kfar Ḥay. He was appointed secretary to Patr. Bulus Masʿad (1854–90), and consecrated bp. of <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref> in 1872. He helped to establish the <ref type="cr">printing</ref> press at Ahden in 1859, which was later bought by Dayr Quzḥayya, and became partner in the General Press (al-Maṭbaʿa al-ʿUmumiyya). He engaged in many polemical discussions, esp. with Bp. Yousef Daoud of the Syr. Cath. Church. He established a number of schools, most notably Al-Ḥikma in 1878 in Beirut. He built a number of churches, esp. the Maron. Cathedral in Beirut in 1894. He was a contemporary of St. Sharbil.</p>
<p>A complete list of his literary works, numbering 44 items, is given by Ḥayek. Of relevance are: 1. a history of Syria in 8 vols. (1893–1905), with an abridged edition (1907); 2. <i>al-Jāmiʿ al-Mufaṣṣal</i>, being the sections from the previous that pertain to the Maronite history (1905); 3.  a book on the lives of Saints (ms.). He also edited: 1. the office of burial in <ref type="cr">Garshuni</ref> (1882); sermons in Garshuni (1884); a lectionary of the Pauline Epistles in Garshuni (1886, 1897, 1901); three liturgical books on the Divine Liturgy (all in 1888); <i>Šḥimto</i>(1890). Finally, he translated theological books from Italian and Latin into Arabic.</p>

<p>Collection of teachings attributed to the twelve apostles. While the provenance of the Didascalia Apostolorum is subject to scholarly debate, the work probably originated in Syria during the 3rd cent. Of the Greek original only fragments remain; there are, however, a number of early translations. Most significant among these is the Syriac translation which is preserved in numerous mss. dated or datable between the 7th (or 8th) and the 20th cent. Vööbus’s 1979 edition includes the evidence of 18 mss., while an additional 23 mss. contain legislative texts that were incorporated in the third chapter of the Didascalia Apostolorum but that also circulated separately. Some of the mss. show traces of a later revision. A fragment of the Didascalia survives furthermore in a 9th-cent. Syriac papyrus, of which Sauget and Brock have each published a folio.The number of Syriac mss. and their geographical as well as chronological spread attest to the significance of the work within the juridical tradition of Syriac Christianity. The date of the Syriac translation is difficult to ascertain; scholars have variously attributed it to the mid-4th cent. (Vööbus, Connolly) or the late 5th through early 6th cent. (Brock, Schöllgen). While the Syriac translation of the Didascalia has occasionally been ascribed to <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, such a claim lacks scholarly support. A Latin translation from the late 4th cent. is also extant, as well as later Arabic and Ethiopic translations. The Didascalia has further been preserved in Greek in the 4th cent. ‘Apostolic Constitutions’, of which the Didascalia makes up the lion’s share.</p>
<p>A pseudepigraphical document, the Didascalia claims to be the product of the twelve apostles. Its real author remains unknown, although the emphasis on instructing bishops has led scholars to suspect episcopal authorship. The document’s stated purpose is the defense of the church against heretics and schismatics, particularly Judaizing Christians (ch. 26). The Didascalia, however, contains a wide range of other material, including advice on the selection and duties of bishops (chs. 4–8, 11–12, 18), male and female deacons (chs. 11, 16), as well as other church officers; instructions on church discipline and penitential practice (chs. 5–7, 9–11); theological direction (ch. 20), and guidelines for appropriate behavior of various groups of lay people within the church (chs. 14–15, 17, 19, 22). Interestingly, the Didascalia supports its arguments with extensive citations from Scripture, so much so that it resembles a topical commentary for church use. Because of its diverse content and regulatory aims, the Didascalia has been categorized as belonging to the Church Order genre, a designation the Didascalia shares with, e.g., the Didache and the Apostolic Tradition of <ref type="cr">Hippolytus</ref>. While the existence of such a genre has recently been called into question, the grouping of the Didascalia with other legislative texts in ancient codices, as well as the interpolation of legislative material concerning, e.g., the election of clergy, between chs. 3 and 4 supports its consideration as an early fore-runner of canon law collections.</p>

<p>Scholar and reform-minded educator. He was born in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> to ʿAbd al-Karīm Dinno and grew up at a time when his Church was at the low ebb, having emerged from nearly a half cent. of Catholic conversion. He also witnessed the arrival of refugees fleeing the 1915 massacres of Syriacs and Armenians in Southeastern Turkey. He saw the dire need to educate the members of his community, young and old in the virtues of his church beliefs and in the richness of its Syriac liturgy and heritage. He was consecrated a deacon on 
30 March 1941, and an archdeacon, by which title he was widely known, on 6 April of the same year by Athanasius Tumo Qaṣīr. Apart from initial schooling at St. Thomas School in Mosul from 1909 to 1918, he was self-taught. He later became a successfull merchant. He mastered the Syriac language and wrote several grammar text books for it. He wrote a number of books and articles defending the Syr. Orth. Church and its beliefs against what he saw as defamations and distortions of historic facts. He wrote on the <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> and Syriac culture and on church history and commented on literary works by others. He paid particular attention to church music. He complied and published a hymn book in Arabic for the Arabic-speaking community of his Church in the Middle East. This was a pioneering enterprise as the book is still extensively used in the Middle East and in the Syriac <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref>. On church revival, he worked closely with Patr. <ref type="cr">Afram Barsoum</ref>. He was in the forefront of the effort to introduce structural church reform, and to promote better education of the clergy through the newly established St. Ephrem Seminary, in which he also taught. He died in 1951, leaving behind a legacy that bore the imprints of a man who was devoted to the betterment of the Church that he so deeply loved to meet the challenges of a new era. Part of this legacy was several unfinished literary works, which Patr. Zakka I ʿIwas has published over the years in the Patriarchal Magazine.</p>

A native of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, and teacher of <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref> and <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, he was renowned in his own day as an exegete. As an important representative of Antiochene christology and exegesis, his works came under a cloud, along with those of Theodore, in the 6th cent. and so much has been lost, though his Commentary on Psalms escaped thanks to its re-attribution to Anastasius (Ps. 1–50, ed. J.-M. Olivier, CCSG 6, 1980; the remainder in PG 33). Although he is regarded as one of the three ‘Greek Doctors’ (with Theodore and <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>) in the Ch. of E., most of what survives in Syriac comes from hostile sources. Quotations from, or references to, his ‘On Providence’, however, are to be found notably in <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref> and <ref type="cr">Isḥaq</ref> <ref type="cr">of Nineveh</ref>.</p>

<p>Metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>, and prolific Syr. Orth. author. 
A biography, by Patr.<ref type="cr"> Michael Rabo</ref>, is unfortunately lost. He was probably born in <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>, which was an important meeting point for Syriac and Greek cultures in the 12th cent. His baptismal name was Yaʿqub. His earliest work was a refutation of a book written by <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon</ref> <ref type="cr">of</ref> <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, who had claimed that the fall of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> to the Seljuks in 1144 took place against God’s will. At Yuḥanon’s request, the Patr. put Yaʿqub (still a deacon) under an interdict, but later, once he had read Yaʿqub’s work, lifted this and appointed him bp. of Marʿash (Germanikia), with the episcopal name Dionysios (1148). After the capture of Marʿash by the Armenians in 1156 he returned to Melitene. In 1164/5, he was offered the see of Amid but declined it, though was later persuaded to accept, after Michael had become patr. (Oct. 1166). At Amid Dionysios restored the church of the Yoldat Aloho.</p>
<p>Dionysios died in November 1171, and was buried on the south side of the church of the Yoldat Aloho in Amid, alongside two patriarchs (Michael, Chronicle, III, 344–5). He must have been at least 50 years old, and perhaps considerably more. He was succeeded as bp. by his synkellos Abraham who, however, died shortly afterwards (Michael, Chronicle, III, 354).</p>
<p>Two slightly conflicting lists of his works survive, one in Michael’s Chronicle (III, 344–5), the other separately (printed in Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 2, 210–11). Many of the works named in these lists do not survive, while those that do survive have so far only partly been published.</p>
<p>Main extant works:</p>
<p>1. Commentaries on the Old Testament. Dionysios was the first Syr. Orth. writer to provide a commentary on the entire Bible. He draws on a great variety of earlier commentators, both Greek (in Syriac translation) and Syriac, including commentators from the Ch. of E. Much of the commentary on the OT was arranged in two parts, ‘material’ (<i>suʿrono</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>it</i>) and ‘spiritual’ (<i>ruḥono</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>it</i>). Of the OT commentaries only those on Psalms 73–82 (ed. S. D. Ryan, <i>Dionysius bar Salibi’s Factual and Spiritual Commentary on Psalms 73–82</i>[Cahiers de la Revue Biblique 57; 2004]) and the ‘spiritual’ commentary on Qohelet (based on the <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref>, rather than the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>) have so far been published 
(W. Strothmann, GOFS 31, 1988). The commentaries on other OT books remain unpublished, though some have been studied in dissertations. The oldest ms. was copied in 1189, only 18 years after his death (for mss., see 
A. Vööbus, in <i>ZAW</i> 84 [1972], 246–9).</p>
<p>2. Commentaries on the New Testament. The Commentaries on Matt., Mark, Luke, Acts, Catholic Epistles, and Apocalypse have been published by I. Sedlacek, J.-B. Chabot, and A. Vaschalde, with LT: Gospels, I.1 (CSCO 15–16; 1906); I.2 (CSCO 77, 85; 1915, 1922); II.1 (CSCO 95, 98; 1931, 1933); II.2 (CSCO 113–4; 1939, 1940); Acts, Catholic Epistles, and Apocalypse (CSCO 53, 60; 1909, 1910). The Comm. on John was later published (without tr.) by R. Lejoly (1975). That on the Pauline Epistles remains unpublished (for mss., see A. Vööbus in <i>Abr Nahrain</i> 9 [1969/70], 39–42). The commentary on the Apocalypse preserves some quotations from the otherwise lost treatise of <ref type="cr">Hippolytus</ref> against Gaius.</p>
<p>3. Commentary on the Liturgy, ed. with LT by 
H. Labourt (CSCO 13–14; 1903). There is an ET by 
B. Varghese, <i>Dionysius Bar Salibi. Commentary on the Eucharist</i> (Kottayam, 1998). Besides the commentary on the Eucharistic liturgy just mentioned, Dionysios also commented on the baptismal service and the Myron (ed. with ET by B. Varghese, <i>Dionysius Bar Salibi. Commentary on Myron and Baptism</i> [Moran Etho 29; 2006]).</p>
<p>4. Commentary on <ref type="cr">Evagrius</ref>’s Centuries. The Syriac text (from a Berlin ms.) has been edited by Mor Julius Çiçek (Glane/Losser; 1991).</p>
<p>5. Commentary on <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>’s logical works (Organon). This commentary covers <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s Eisagoge (‘Introduction’) and the first three books of the corpus of Aristotle’s logical works, namely, Categories, Interpretation, and Analytics I–II. The work was completed in 1148, shortly after Dionysios had become bp. of Marʿash. Dionysios states that his purpose was to provide an abbreviation of previous commentators. At the end of the work he complains about the barbarity and ignorance shown by the Syriac translator of Analytics  II. The work survives, not quite complete, in ms. Cambridge Gg. 2.14 (unpublished).</p>
<p>6. Polemical Works. Of his polemical works only the treatises against the Armenians (ed. A. Mingana, in <i>Woodbrooke Studies</i> 4 [1931], with ET), the Melkites (ed. Mingana, in <i>Woodbrooke Studies</i> 1 [1927], with ET), the Jews (ed. de Zwaan, 1906; text only), and the Muslims (J. P. Amar, CSCO 614–5; 2005) have been published. There are important studies of the last by A. Mingana (<i>BJRL</i>9 [1925], 188–240, on Qurʾān quotations) and 
S. H. Griffith (<i>SymSyr</i> IV, 353–65). An analysis of the treatise against the Nestorians was given by F. Nau in <i>ROC</i> II.4 (1909), 298–320.</p>
<p>7. Anaphoras. Three anaphoras attributed to Dionysios are known, but only the first (which is also sometimes attributed to <ref type="cr">Dionysius the Areopagite</ref>) has been published (e.g. Pampakuda editions of 1976, 1986; ed. Çiçek, 1985; LT in E. Renaudot, <i>Liturgiarum Orientalium Collectio</i> [1847], vol. 2, 448–52).</p>
<p>8. Canons. The penitential canons associated with Dionysios’s name survive in many different forms, whose interrelationships are studied by A. Vööbus in <i>Kanonessammlungen</i>, vol. IB (CSCO 317; 1970), 405–39; for other canons attributed to Dionysios see <i>Kanonessammlungen</i>, vol. IA, 240–53.</p>
<p>Lost works:</p>
<p>1. Commentaries on the doctrinal works of <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nyssa</ref>, <ref type="cr">Basil</ref>, Dionysius the Areopagite, <ref type="cr">Severus</ref>, <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref>.</p>

<p>Patr. 818–45, historian. Dionysios came from the village of Tel Maḥre. He was a monk in the monastery of John bar Aphtonia at <ref type="cr">Qenneshre</ref>, but after its destruction by fire in ca. 810, he moved to another monastery and eventually to the Monastery of Mar Yaʿqub at Kayshum. On 1 Aug. 818 at the synod in Kallinikos, on the suggestion of bp. Theodoros of the same monastery, Dionysios was elected patr. Then, in three successive days he was ordained deacon, priest, and patriarch (Michael, 503/III, 43).</p>
<p>At the very beginning of his pontificate he had to face opposition from Abraham, whom Dionysios calls Abiram (cp. Num. 16), a monk of Qarṭmin, and his followers of the Monastery of Gubba Barraya. The group was schismatic (Abraham ordained his own bishops), but also held dissenting views in the matter of the liturgical formula <i>Panem caelestem frangimus</i> (‘We break the heavenly bread’), which they wished to be accepted by the whole Syr. Orth. Church. The conflict in this matter had been troubling the Church already during the pontificate of Dionysios’s predecessor, Patr. <ref type="cr">Quryaqos</ref>. As it proved impossible to solve it, the synod of Kallinikos, at which Dionysios was elected, accepted that the usage of the formula was at the discretion of every bp. However not even this tolerant solution was accepted by Abraham’s group. Dionysios however succeeded in appeasing at least the people and monks of the diocese of Cyrrhus, who previously had supported Abraham. The latter repeatedly presented himself to the Muslim authorities as the legitimate patr., but without receiving official recognition (Michael 507, 508–12 / III, 49, 55–9), due to Dionysios’s intervention. In 820 Dionysios went to <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> where he received the confirmation of his election from Caliph al-Maʾmūn. In 829, after long talks with the caliph, Dionysios obtained from him a decree to the effect that non-legitimate bishops would not be officially approved by the Muslims. In this way Abraham no longer presented a threat to Dionysios’s authority or the unity of the Church. He died in 837, but the schism nevertheless continued, as Abraham’s supporters elected his brother Shemʿun counter-patriarch. Some bishops, however, turned their allegiance to Dionysios, so that this later phase of the schism was less troublesome, as Dionysios himself reports (Chronicle of 1234, 234/206).</p>
<p>Another problem Dionysios had to face was the opposition of the eastern (maphrianate) bishops, among whom the main figure was Basil bp. of <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref>. As he antagonised also the Muslims of his diocese, he was arrested by the Muslim authorities, which however also led to anti-Christian acts of violence, including destruction of churches, e.g. in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> and <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>. Dionysios, together with his brother, <ref type="cr">Theodosios bp. of Edessa</ref>, went to Egypt to meet Emir ʿAbdallāh, from whom he received an edict commanding any further destruction of churches to stop and to rebuild the ones that had been destroyed (Michael, 516 / III, 63–4).</p>
<p>Dionysios’s relations with the Muslim authorities were so good that on the caliph’s request he even intervened far beyond his own jurisdiction, namely in the matters of a group of Coptic Christians, known as Bashmurites, who had revolted against their Muslim oppressors. It seems that thanks to his intervention the caliph did not punish them with death but deportation.</p>
<p>During his pontificate Dionysios ordained 99 bishops (Michael, 754–55 / III, 453–55). He died on 22 Aug. 845 and was buried in his former monastery of Qen­neshre.</p>
<p>Dionysios was the author of an historical work in two parts, dealing with ecclesiastical (written earlier) and with secular matters, altogether in 16 books. Dedicated to <ref type="cr">Iwannis of Dara</ref>, it covered the period of over two and a half centuries, from the accession of the Byzantine emperor Maurice (582) until the death of Emperor Theophilos and of Caliph Abū Isḥāq al-Muʿtaṣim (842) (Michael, Chronicle, 544 / III, 111). It has not been preserved, except for fragments (ed. Brooks, CSCO 84, 88) and is known mostly from later Syriac chronicles, whose authors used it as their source, namely the anonymous <ref type="cr">Chronicle of 1234</ref> and the Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Michael Rabo</ref>.</p>
<p>Dionysios’s sources are not directly known, but the analyses by J.-B. Chabot (Introduction to<i> Chronique de Michel</i>, XXXII–XXXIV) and A. Palmer and R. Hoyland (<i>The Seventh Century</i>, 95–104) have identified some of them: Daniel son of Mushe (8th cent.), Yoḥannan son of Shmu’el, <ref type="cr">Theophilos</ref> the ‘Chalcedonian’, son of Toma of Edessa, the Common Source of the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes (d. 818), the Melkite Agapius of Mabbug, who wrote in Arabic (10th cent.), part of the material preserved in the Chronicle to the year 724, and some other Syriac, but also Greek and Arabic sources.</p>
<p>Due to an erroneous attribution by J. S. Assemani, Dionysios was until the end of the 19th century considered to be the author of the anonymous <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>, which consequently became known as that of Pseudo-Dionysios of Tel Maḥre.</p>
<p>Dionysios also promulgated some disciplinary canons, preserved in the Synodicon of the Syr. Orth. Church (ed. Vööbus). Another text of his is his profession of faith in Arabic, most probably one that he sent to the Coptic patr. of Alexandria (as was customary for newly elected patriarchs of both churches), in which, however, he says nothing about the current issues (the <i>Panem caelestem</i> controversy).</p>

<p>Greek author of an influential corpus of mystical writings. The author, whose identity remains unclear, must have been writing after the Neoplatonist Proclus (d. 485), upon whose works he draws, and before 532, when the writings are first mentioned; it is likely that he was writing in Syria or Palestine. The corpus consists of books entitled: On the Celestial Hierarchy (CH); On the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy (EH); the Divine Names (DN); the Mystical Theology (MT); and 10 Letters. These were translated into Syriac by <ref type="cr">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref> (d. 536), and again, in a revised form by Phocas of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> in the late 7th cent. The former survives in a single ms. (Sinai Syr. 52), the latter in several mss. The earlier version is a particularly important witness to the earliest form of the Greek text (critical edition by B. Suchla, G. Heil and A. M. Ritter, in <i>PTS</i> 33, 36; 1990, 1991); Sergios’s translation provides the unusual order of DN, CH, MT, EH, Letters. Neither Syriac version has yet been published in full; thus the only editions available so far are: MT, ch. 1: J.-M. Hornus, in <i>ParOr</i> 1 (1970), 69–94 (both versions); and EH, ch. 4 (on Myron): W. Strothmann, GOFS 15:
1–2 (1977) (both versions).</p>
<p>Already in the 6th cent. the Corpus was provided with Greek Scholia by John Scholasticus, and later by others too; those by John were also translated into Syriac, and further scholia were added by a number of Syriac authors. The scholia are only found in mss. of Phocas’s version.</p>
<p>There are also several later Syriac works associated with Dionysius the Areopagite: 1. The Book of the Holy Hierotheos (ed. with ET, F. S. Marsh; 1927), probably by <ref type="cr">Sṭephanos bar Ṣudayli</ref>; this work claims to be by the teacher of Dionysius; on it see K. Pinggéra, <i>All-Erlösung und All-Einheit</i> (2002); 2. A supposed autobiography (ed. M. Kugener, in <i>OC</i> 7 [1907], 292–348); 3. an astronomical and meteorological treatise (ed. Kugener, in <i>Actes</i> <i>XIV Congrès International des Orientalistes</i>, vol. 2 (1905), 137–94; also by G. Furlani, in <i>JRAS</i>1917, 245–72); and 4. an Anaphora (ed. M.

<p>Greek grammarian and philologist; pupil of Aristarchus of Samothrace; and alleged author of the <i>Téchnē grammatik</i><i>ē</i><cTypeface:Italic>́ (‘Art of Grammar’), which became the standard grammar handbook in Constantinople after the 5th cent. The attribution of the treatise to Dionysius has been long debated, but there is now some agreement that the book is the result of the compilation of chronologically heterogeneous materials. The work, of which an Armenian translation also exists, was adapted into Syriac in the 6th cent. This translation is attributed by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> and by E.-Syr. mss. to the <i>maqryānā</i> (‘teacher of reading’) <ref type="cr">Yawsep Huzaya</ref> (d. before 580), disciple of <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref> at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>, and author of linguistic and philological studies that have not survived. The name of the translator is missing in the W.-Syr. ms. tradition. The Syriac version of the <i>Téchnē grammatik</i><i>ē</i><cTypeface:Italic>́ presents a contrastive analysis of Syriac and Greek, and its reflection on Syriac morphosyntax shows a certain degree of originality. In this adaptation the first ten chapters of the text are missing. While the omission of chapters 2–9, which treat orthographic, phonologic, and prosodic issues, can be explained with the difficulties of applying Greek grammatical categories to the Syriac language, the absence of the first, programmatic chapter has been tentatively related to a possible reluctance on the part of the translator to praise the study of literary pagan texts (Contini).</p>

</head><ab type="infobox"/>Yūḥannā Dūlabānī (1885–1969) [Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Modern writer, educator and Syr. Orth. bp. of <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> (1947–69). He was born and raised in Mardin and embarked on a shoe-making career. As he was the only son to his parents, they objected to his idea of becoming a monk. Dolabani left his career and toured various local monasteries. At the request of his parents, Patr. <ref type="cr">ʿAbdullāh Ṣaṭṭūf</ref> tried to convince young Yuḥanon to forget about monastic life, but to no avail. In 1907, he joined Dayro d-Noṭpo, became a monk in 1908, and was ordained priest in 1918. He taught at the local school of <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>, other monasteries, and the Syr. Orth. Orphanage of Adana (see <ref type="cr">Taw Mim Semkath</ref>). Dolabani accompanied Patr. <ref type="cr">Eliya III</ref> on two pastoral tours in the Middle East: the first in 1919 prompted by the aftermath of World War I and the <ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref> massacres, and the second in 1925 to <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> and <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> where he spent two years teaching at <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Mark</ref>. When the newly consecrated Patr. <ref type="cr">Afram Barsoum</ref> moved the patriarchal seat from Mardin to <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref> in 1933 due to current socio-political difficulties, the community leadership in Mardin desired to elect Dolabani as anti-Patr. in defiance. Dolabani rejected the move and denounced rumours of any such election publicly in 1934. In 1947, Mardin became a diocese and Dolabani was consecrated its bp. He spent his last days at Dayr al-Zaʿfarān where he was buried.</p>
<p>He edited the following works: an abridged version of the <i>Beth Gazo</i> (Mardin, 1913); a prayer book for priests (Mardin, 1952); a list of lectionary readings (Mardin, 1954); selected poems of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (Jerusalem, 1929); poems of <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon Bar Maʿdani</ref> (Jerusalem, 1929); poems of <ref type="cr">Nuḥ the Lebanese</ref> (1956); and Bar ʿEbroyo’s ‘Book of the Dove’ (Mardin, 1916). He authored over 40 books in Syriac, Arabic, and Turkish, the most important of which are the following: A pedagogical Syriac Grammar (vol. 1, Mardin, 1915; vol. 2 Glane/Losser, 1997); A history of the patriarchs (Glane/Losser, 1990); and Catalogues of the Syriac mss. of Dayro d-Mor Marqos, Dayr al-Zaʿfarān, and other churches and monasteries (Aleppo, 1994). Finally, he translated many works from Arabic into Syriac, especially Barsoum’s <i>al-Lu</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>lu</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i> al-manthūr</i>, and Boulos Behnam’s drama <i>Theodora</i>. Dolabani drew up a list of his writings of 82 items, most of which remain unpublished. His autobiography was published posthumously (<i>Tašʿito d-ḥayaw d-Dolabani</i>, 2007).</p>

</LemmaTitle><p><ref type="cr">Sureth</ref> poetic genre. Probably deriving from the Semitic root *<i>drk</i> ‘to tread, step on’, the term seems to be related to the Mesopotamian Aramaic word \<<cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>drkt</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ\> ‘song, hymn’. The spelling <i>dureg</i> (from Classical Syriac *<i>drg</i> ‘to step forward’) is common in Urmi Neo-Aramaic. Kurdish etymologies have also been proposed: <i>du-</i> ‘two’ + <i>r</i><i>êk</i> ‘in good order’ \> ‘couplet’; Arabic *<i>dwr</i> ‘be circular’ + Kurdish -<i>ek</i> (see the Dehok Jewish Neo-Aramaic equivalent, meaning ‘round bread’) \> ‘cyclic poem’. In the mss., <i>dorekthā</i> (pl. <i>dorekyāthā</i>) is used as an equivalent of Classical Syriac <i>memrā</i>, <i>soghithā</i>, or <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>onithā</i>. Although the first authors (<ref type="cr">Israel of Alqosh</ref> and <ref type="cr">Yawsep of Telkepe</ref>) were not Catholic, ms. collections of <i>dorekyāthā</i> have been preserved by the Chald. communities of Northern Iraq and from the 19th cent. onwards the genre has been cultivated predominantly by Chald. poets. The 19th-cent.<i> dorekthā</i> On the Virgin Mary (1st line <i>B-šemm</i><i>ā d-bābā u-bronā</i> ‘In the name of the Father and of the Son’), attributed to the Sureth poet David Kora or to the French Dominicain <ref type="cr">J.  Rhétoré</ref>, has become a kind of national hymn for the Chaldeans of the plain of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>. The <i>dorekyāthā</i> are usually structured in stanzas of 3, 4, or 6 lines, and their form suits the requirements of an oral transmission perfectly. Melodies are sometimes mentioned at the beginning of the text. Rhythmical repetition creates rather lengthy texts which are, however, easy to memorize and listener-friendly. Contents range from paraenetic exegesis to hagiography. From the 18th cent. onwards, Sureth poets followed the path of late E.-Syr. masters such as <ref type="cr">Gewargis Warda</ref> in writing on disasters which befell Syrian communities: pestilences, famines, wars. For this reason the term <i>dorekthā</i> has sometimes been translated as ‘complaint’.</p>

<p>Belgian Syriac scholar, editor of CSCO Scriptores Syri and Subsidia. Educated at the Catholic University of Louvain, he was appointed to the Chair of Theology in 1927, but his critical approach to the subject resulted in his being deprived of this in 1942, whereupon he transferred to the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, where he taught Oriental languages until his retirement in 1966. He was eventually reintegrated into the Faculty of Theology in 1948, due to the intervention of Cardinal G. Mercati and Pope Pius XII, and later (1965) Cardinal Suenens saw to his full rehabilition. He became editor of CSCO in 1948, and under his direction over 300 volumes were published. His own early work, <i>Julien d’Halicarnasse et sa controverse avec Sé</i><i>vère d’Antioche</i>(1924), was the first to point out the real issues behind this controversy. His publications of Syriac texts in the CSCO for the most part concern the Egyptian monastic tradition: they cover the Asceticon of <ref type="cr">Isaiah of Scetis</ref> (CSCO 289–90, 293–4; 1968), the Commentary on Abba Isaiah’s Asceticon by <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref> (CSCO 326–7; 1972), another, anonymous, Commentary on it (CSCO 336–7; 1973), <ref type="cr">Palladius</ref>’s ‘Lausiac History’ in its different recensions (CSCO 389–90, 397–8; 1978), and <ref type="cr">Athanasius</ref>’s ‘Life of Antony’ (CSCO 417–8; 1980). Several of these volumes include long introductions, in some cases (‘Lausiac History’, ‘Life of Antony’), arguing that the earliest Syriac recensions were translated from lost forms of the Greek text; if correct, this would have important implications for the traditional authorship of these works. As far as the ‘Life of Antony’ is concerned, subsequent scholarship has mostly come down against his views. He had also planned to edit the Syriac Apophthegmata collections (‘Sayings of the Desert Fathers’), but this was unfortunately never completed. Together with R. Hespel, he provided the French translation of <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>’s ‘Book of Scholia’ (CSCO 431–2; 1981), whose text alone had been published long ago (CSCO 55, 69; 1910, 1912) by <ref type="cr">A.

<p>Scholar of Aramaic, Syriac, and religions of Late Antiqu­ity. He was Professor of Semitic Languages and Cultures and the Archeology of the Near East at the University of Groningen (The Netherlands). After his edition of the ‘Book of the Laws of Countries’ and his dissertation on <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref> of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (1966), his broad and varied interests in Syriac studies were particularly focused on the language, literature, culture, and religion of early Syriac Christianity and its center, the city of Edessa. His many publications in this field concern among other things the pagan religions in Edessa and Syria, Judaism, Gnosticism, Christian heresies, Manichaeism, Marcionism, and early Syriac literature such as the <ref type="cr">Odes of Solomon</ref>, the works of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, and the <ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref>. A special field of attention is represented by his studies of Aramaic <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref>, in particular the Old Syriac inscriptions of Edessa and Osrhoene. Collections of his scholarly articles were published in 1984 and 1994. Two Festschrifts were offered to him in 1999.</p>

<Author>G. J. Reinink</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Dura-Europos
</LemmaTitle><p>Ancient city situated on the west bank of the Middle Euphrates, today known as Tell Ṣāliḥiyya, some 90 km. south-east of Dayr al-Zor, Syria. King Seleucus Nicator founded the city at a place known as Dura around 300  BC and gave it the name of his birthplace in Macedonia, Europos. In antiquity, either the name Dura or Europos was used; the combined name Dura-Europos is a modern invention.</p>
<p>After having been ruled by the Macedonians and Greeks, the city was conquered by the Parthians around 113 BC and remained a military outpost of the Parthian Empire until AD 165. In that year the city came under Roman rule and was to play an important role in the defense of the Roman Empire. Around 250, the Sasanians took hold of the city. Following its destruction, in 256, the city was abandoned and fell into oblivion. Rediscovered in 1920, Dura was excavated mainly by a French-American team between 1928 and 1937. Work was interrupted by the Second World War and was only resumed in 1986, now by a Syrian-French mission.</p>
<p>Both its military role and its function as a commercial center in the trade between East and West explain the presence of many sojourners of various origins, having different religions and speaking different languages. Greek, in all likelihood, was the main language for official purposes throughout the history of the city and most inscriptions are in Greek. In addition, various <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> language forms must have been spoken and written, although it has not been possible to pinpoint the local dialect of Dura. In the inscriptions of the synagogue, Jewish Aramaic is found, and the Palmyrene community of Dura used the Palmyrene Aramaic language and script. A few inscriptions are in Syriac, comparable to the non-Christian <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref> of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (most recently Bertolino, 54–8). In recent years Dura has received much scholarly attention for the ways in which different religious communities co-existed and interacted (Dirven; Elsner; Kaizer), while the exceptionally rich iconography of the Jewish synagogue has been studied in connection with early Christian art (Weitzman and Kessler).</p>
<p>Among the many important archeological discoveries there is a Christian assembly house with a baptistery annexed to it. The baptistery is decorated with wall paintings, representing scenes from the OT (e.g. Adam and Eve, David and Goliath) as well as from the NT (e.g. the Good Shepherd, Christ walking on the water, Resurrection scenes). Inscriptions are in Greek; a graffito from the courtyard, however, may be interpreted as a Syriac alphabet (Bertolino, 57). A unique Greek parchment fragment containing some verses of the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref> provides a further reference to Christianity in this garrison town around the middle of the 3rd cent.</p>
<p>More significant for Syriac studies is the discovery, early in 1933, of a Syriac parchment (catalogued as 
P. Dura 28) describing the purchase made by a resident of <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref> of a twenty-eight year old female slave from an Edessene lady. The transaction is dated in ‘the month of Iyyar, the year 554 by the former reckoning’ and in ‘the year 31 of the Freedom of ... Edessa ...’, which is AD 243 (the Freedom of Edessa refers to the city gaining the status of a Roman <i>colonia</i> in 213). This document bears witness to the use of Syriac as the language of official transactions in Edessa and its environs, in the middle of the 3rd cent. Situated outside the realm of Edessene Christianity, the language of this document is the continuation of the language used in inscriptions of Edessa and Osrhoene. Two more Syriac legal documents from the Middle Euphrates area, also dating from the early 240s, which came to light in the 1980s, provide further evidence to the use of Syriac for secular purposes (see <ref type="cr">Old Syriac documents</ref>).</p>

<p>Professor at the Collège de France of Paris, Syriac scholar. Paul-Rubens Duval was born on 25 Oct. 1839, as the son of the mayor of the town of Morsang sur Seine (Seine et Marne). His father, who loved the art of the Renaissance, wanted his son to become an artist and appropriately named him ‘Paul-Rubens’. The young man, however, preferred the study of law and received a law degree in 1860. While working at a lawyer’s office in Paris, he met with Edmond Drouin, with whom he began to study eastern languages as a pastime at the École Pratique des Hautes Études and in the Collège de France. In 1867, Duval quit his law position and went to Göttingen, Germany, where he studied for two years under the great biblical scholar and Semitist Heinrich Ewald, and where he also made the acquaintance of another well-known biblical scholar, Julius Wellhausen. Duval then traveled to the Middle East. He took part in the festivities surrounding the opening of the Suez Canal by the French Empress Eugénie and subsequently visited Palestine and the Syrian coast. Upon his return to France, he decided to devote himself entirely to the study of Semitic languages and particularly <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref>, with a special interest in lexicography and dialectology. His first publication dealt with the Aramaic dialect of Maʿlula (1879). In 1881 his <i>Traité de grammaire syriaque</i> followed. This important grammar of Syriac, published one year after the first edition of <ref type="cr">Theodor Nöldeke</ref>’s <i>Kurzgefasste syrische Grammatik</i>(1880), came as a surprise, since Duval was not yet known as an authority in the field of Syriac studies. Between 1886 and 1893 he was an <i>auxiliaire</i>of the French <i>Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres</i>, in charge of the preparation of the <i>Pars aramaica</i> of the <i>Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum</i>, an ambitious project aiming at the publication of all Semitic inscriptions. In 1895 the Collège de France recreated for him the chair that once had been occupied by the famous orientalist scholar Barthélemy d’Herbelot (1625–95) but was discontinued in 1770. In his capacity as professor of Aramaic language and literature at the prestigious Collège de France, Duval taught Syriac topics, which was his primary interest, as well as Targumic Aramaic. For reasons of poor health, he tried to obtain a substitute from 1904 onwards, but since he was unsuccessful in this, he continued teaching until 1907, when the condition of his health forced him to resign. He retired to the family house in Morsang sur Seine, where he died on 10 May 1911. While his publications cover various subfields of Aramaic studies, including Neo-Aramaic dialects, Palmyrene, Nabataean, and Targumic lexicography, his major works are in the field of Syriac studies.</p>

<p>Maronite Patr. (1670–1704) and scholar. He was born on 2 Aug. 1630 in Ahden, and as a boy he was sent (in 1641) to Rome to study at the Maronite College. While in Rome he took the opportunity to collect historical materials on Maronite history. He returned home in 1655, and was ordained priest in 1656. In 1668 he was made bp. of Nicosia (Cyprus), and two years later was elected Patr. He died on 3 May 1704. Much of his prolific output, mostly in the fields of liturgical theology and history, was only published posthumously, or in some cases still remains in manuscript.

</LemmaTitle><p>The 5th cent. witnessed much controversy over how best to describe the relationship between the divinity and humanity in the incarnate Christ while maintaining, on the one hand the transcendence of the Godhead, and on the other, the full reality of the incarnation.</p>
<label type="subsection">The Origins of Division</label>
<p>In the second quarter of the 5th cent. two different approaches to christology emerged, usually referred to as ‘Antiochene’ and ‘Alexandrian’, after the locations of the leading theologians of each. Different concerns and starting points led to differences of emphasis on either side, giving rise to two different conceptions of how salvation for humanity comes about. For the Antiochenes, a concern for the transcendence of the divinity meant that it was important to maintain the distinction between the divinity and the humanity in the incarnate Christ (hence their dislike of ‘theopaschite’ language): for them, salvation for humanity was achieved by means of the humanity of Christ, raised up at the Ascension; as a result, it was important for them to call Mary ‘mother of Christ’ and not ‘mother of God’. By contrast, for the Alexandrians, salvation is brought about by the divine Word ‘becoming’, but without change, fully human at the incarnation. Thus for them it was essential to stress the ‘oneness’ in the incarnate Christ. For each side, the other side’s approach was seen at best as unsatisfactory, and at worst, heretical.</p>
<p>Successive Roman emperors attempted to get the issue resolved by convening a series of Councils, of which those at Ephesus (431) and at Chalcedon (451) proved to be the most important, and as matters turned out, the most divisive. At Ephesus, owing to the delayed arrival of the Antiochene bishops (under John, bp. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>), the Alexandrian bishops (under <ref type="cr">Cyril</ref>, bp. of Alexandria) met by themselves and deposed <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>, bp. of Constantinople, a leading proponent of Antiochene christology. When the Antiochene bishops subsequently arrived they held their own council, and condemned Cyril’s. Two years later, in 433, a compromise was reached (the ‘Formulary of Reunion’). Polarization of the different positions, however, continued, and in the course of this three technical terms became prominent in formulations of christology, above all at the Council of Chalcedon: person (<i>parṣopā</i>; Greek <i>prosopon</i>), nature (<i>kyānā</i>; Greek <i>physis</i>), and ‘hypostasis’ (<i>qnom</i><i>ā</i>), the last two of which were understood in different ways by different people. According to the dogmatic Definition of faith laid down at Chalcedon, the incarnate Christ is ‘made known in two natures ... concurring into one person and one hypostasis’. This formulation gave rise to a sharp division between those who spoke of ‘two natures’ in the incarnate Christ (‘dyophysites’) and those who adhered to Cyril’s formula ‘one incarnate nature of God the Word’ (‘miaphysites’).</p>
<p>It was very largely the imposition, by Justin (518–527) and especially Justinian (527–565) of Chalcedon’s Definition of faith as the sole touchstone of orthodoxy that led to the three-way split in Eastern Christianity which is represented today by three separate traditions: 1. the Oriental Orthodox Churches, among which is the <ref type="cr">Syr. Orthodox</ref>; these accept the Council of Ephesus of 431, but not the Council of Chalcedon; 2. the Churches which accept both the Council of Ephesus and that of Chalcedon (the various Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, and Reformed Churches); and 3. the <ref type="cr">Church of the East</ref>, which does not accept either of the two Councils (since its adherents were largely outside the Roman Empire, the imperial councils did not directly concern them).</p>
<p>For both the Oriental Orthodox and the Church of the East the Chalcedonian Definition was seen as illogical, the former objecting to ‘in two natures’ and the latter to ‘one hypostasis’. The basic problem lay in different understandings of two of the terms used, ‘nature’ (<i>physis</i>/<i>kyānā</i>) and ‘hypostasis’ (<i>qnomā</i>): for the miaphysites ‘nature’ implied ‘hypostasis’ (and not <i>ousia</i>), while for the Church of the East <i>qnomā</i> meant ‘set of characteristics’, and not ‘hypostasis’. With these different understandings it can readily be seen that the Chalcedonian Definition was not satisfactory. Thus the miaphysites (Syr. and other Oriental Orthodox) insisted on Cyril’s ‘one incarnate nature’, while the Church of the East spoke of ‘two natures with their <i>qnome</i>’ (where <i>qnome</i> has the sense of ‘characteristics’ and not ‘<i>hypostaseis</i>’). In an attempt to overcome the problem, the ‘Neo-Chalcedonians’ of the early 6th cent. held that either ‘in two natures’ or ‘out of two natures’ was acceptable (the latter, which had been in the draft of the Council’s Definition, was acceptable to the Syr. Orth.), but attempts at bringing about agreement by Justinian and others failed, though this was very nearly achieved under Heraclius in the early 630s with both the Syr. Orth. and the Church of the East. The Arab invasions, which followed shortly after, then fossilized not only the divisions, but also the misleading polemical names given by Chalcedonians to their opponents: ‘Nestorians’ (implying a belief in two sons, the Son of God and the son of Mary), ‘Eutychians’ (implying a belief that the Christ was not ‘consubstantial with us’, as well as ‘with the Father’), and ‘Monophysites’ (implying a Eutychian position) — positions which the Church of the East and Syr. Orth. have always strongly rejected. On every side the polemical literature became increasingly scholastic in character, although a few voices (notably that of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>) were to be heard, pointing out that underlying the conflicting doctrinal formulae there lay a consensus on the essential understanding of the incarnation. The general feeling of antagonism between Churches only became increased as a result of the creation of the Eastern Rite Catholic Churches (<ref type="cr">Chaldean</ref>, 1553; <ref type="cr">Syrian Catholic</ref>, 1782), and of the various Protestant missions of the 19th cent. Though the help in educational matters given by different Western Churches benefited individual Syr. Churches, this never led to any real dialogue, and so matters continued largely unchanged until the late 20th cent. when ecumenical dialogue at last began to remove the fog of misconceptions on all sides.</p>
<label type="subsection">Modern Dialogue</label>
<p>The aim of modern dialogue is not uniformity, but unity through the acceptance of variety. At the end of the very first meeting of the Oriental and Eastern Ortho­dox non-official dialogue, in 1964, the communiqué stated ‘on the essence of the Christological dogma we found ourselves in full agreement. Through the different terminologies used by each side, we saw the same truth expressed’. The four non-official dialogues were followed by an Official Dialogue, and at the end of the third meeting (1990) it was recommended that a mutual lifting of anathemas and condemnations should take place (this, however, still remains to be implemented). In 1991 an important agreement on various practical matters was made between the Syr. Orth. and Rum Orth. Patriarchs of Antioch.</p>
<p>Dialogue between the Oriental Orthodox and Catholic Churches began in 1971 with a series of non-official meetings in Vienna initiated by the Pro Oriente Foundation. The very first meeting produced what came to be known as ‘the Vienna Christological formula’, which has played an important part in subsequent Official Dialogue. The 6th meeting of this Dialogue took place in Jan. 2009, with the theme ‘The Nature, Constitution and Mission of the Church’. Meetings also took place between the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius Yaʿqub III</ref> and Pope Paul VI in 1971, and between Patr. Ignatius Zakka I and Pope John Paul II in 1984. Each ended with a joint communiqué.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1994, Pro Oriente has arranged a series of non-official meetings entitled ‘Syriac Dialogue’, involving all the different Syr. Churches; these have proved most helpful in clearing away traditional misunderstandings, especially concerning the christology of the Church of the East. In particular it was soon recognized that ‘Nestorius’ (and hence ‘Nestorianism’) means completely different things to different people: to the Church of the East Nestorius is primarily seen as a leading figure, alongside Diodore and <ref type="cr">Theodore</ref>, of the dyophysite cause, but to the Oriental Orthodox he is an arch-heretic who divided Christ into two sons, while to modern scholarship the real character of his christology is disputed and remains unclear. In any case, the theology of the Church of the East is far more under the influence of the writings of Theodore (in a modified form) than of those of Nestorius.</p>
<p>The Church of the East had at first been left out of the wider dialogue in the 1960s and 1970s, but in 1984 Patr. Mar Denḥa IV had an official meeting with Pope John Paul II in Rome, and ten years later, on 11  Nov. 1994, the two heads of Churches issued a historical Common Declaration of Faith. A further important event, in 1997, was the decision of the synods of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church to inaugurate moves to bring about the full ecclesial union of the two Churches; an important step towards this was the Vatican’s publication (26 Oct. 2001) of ‘Guidelines for admission to the Eucharist between the Chaldean Catholic and the Assyrian Church of the East’, which incorporated recognition of the legitimacy of the Anaphora of Addai and Mari in its original form, without any explicit Institution Narrative. Another momentous decision of the synod of the Assyrian Church of the East in 1997 was to lift unilaterally all anathemas against persons in other Churches whom they had traditionally regarded as heretical, thus setting an example for all other Churches. Unfortunately relations between the Church of the East and the Oriental Orthodox Churches (in particular the Coptic) have remained problematic, at least on the official level, and the Church of the East still has not yet been admitted as a member of the Middle East Council of Churches.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The town of Eddé lies in the foothills of Mount Lebanon, above the town of Batrun (Botrom). The church of Mar Saba, which nowadays is Maronite, is an imposing Crusader building from the 12th cent., with a wide central nave and side aisles, under a complicated system of rib vaulting. An open narthex with groin vaults adorns the west end. The interior of the church was cleaned of white wash only recently, and a few fragments of wall painting were exposed which are now being preserved.</p>
<p>On the northern wall, near the entrance, are two fragments of painting representing the Dormition of the Virgin. In this imposing scene, only a few of the apostles, angels, and <ref type="cr">Dionysius the Areopagite</ref> can still be distinguished. An inscription above the Dormition was read by the Maron. Patr. <ref type="cr">Isṭifān al-Duwayhī</ref>, in the 17th cent., where he gives the date of this painting as the Greek year 1573 (= AD 1261/2).</p>
<p>There are also a fine Crucifixion on the northern wall of the nave, above the arches; an imposing but very damaged painting of the Virgin in the position known as the Nikopoia, with the Christ Child held frontally on her lap; and the scant remains of several equestrian cavaliers and other saints.</p>
<p>The Virgin Nikopoia is inscribed in Greek and stylistically this painting belongs to the Syr. Orth. style of the 12th cent. The inscriptions of the Dormition, however, are in Syriac. In spite of the Syriac inscriptions, this Dormition shows a fine 13th-cent. style that most closely follows the style of painting associated with Constantinople in the 13th cent. This style is unquestionably Byzantine and far removed from the Syr. Orth. style of other Lebanese paintings.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Modern Urfa, Syriac Urhay, and ancient Adme, on the Balikh river, to the northwest of <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref> in southeastern Turkey. In ancient times Edessa was a caravan city on a trade route mentioned in Old Assyrian and Babylonian itineraries as Adme, Admi, and Admum, located beside Ḥarran. <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>associates Edessa with biblical Erech (the ancient Sumerian Uruk) ruled by the legendary Nimrod. Another source associates its name with its mythical first ruler ʾRHY BR ḤWYʾ, whereas Jewish and Islamic traditions conveniently turned the city into the dwelling place of Abraham. In 304 BC, Seleucus I Nicator rebuilt the ancient settlement into a Hellenistic polis, naming it after the Macedonian city of Edessa, possibly because both localities enjoyed plentiful water. The Syriac name <i>Urhay</i> (Arabic <i>al-Rahhā</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ) may derive from the name Antiochia Kallirhoe ‘Antioch by the Kallirhoe’ inscribed on coins struck there by Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175–64 BC). The city became part of the small province of Osrhoene created after the defeat of Antiochus Sidetes in 130–129 BC at the hands of the Parthians. From this time the province enjoyed independence, being ruled by local kings (most of whom were named Abgar or Maʿnu) until AD 213 when it turned into a Roman colony (see <ref type="cr">Abgarids</ref>). Christianity spread out in Mesopotamia probably through Edessa, and in any case, its <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> dialect attested in inscriptions, deeds of sales, and coins, became the language of Syriac Christianity. Edessa is the scene of Addai’s missionary activities according to the <ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref>, and it had a church destroyed in 201 by the flooding of the Daiṣan, the river that passed through the city. This is reported by the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, which drew on the royal archives of the city. During the 3rd and 4th cent. Edessa witnessed a diversity of Christian traditions including followers of <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>, <ref type="cr">Marcion</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Mani</ref>, all contending with Roman ecclesiastical orthodoxy championed by Ephrem 
(d. 373). During most of the 5th cent. Edessa was the scene of struggles between ‘Nestorians’ and Mia­physites, opposing Bp. <ref type="cr">Rabbula</ref> (d. 435), an archenemy of Nestorianism, and <ref type="cr">Hiba</ref> (d. 457) who, while teaching at the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref>, assisted in the translation of the works of <ref type="cr">Theodore</ref> and other Antiochene theologians from Greek into Syriac. After succeeding Rabbula as bp. of Edessa, Hiba eventually anathematized both <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref> and <ref type="cr">Eutyches</ref>, but the suppression of Nestorianism in the city occurred during the time of bp. Qiyore (d. 498), under whose instigation the ‘School of the Persians’ was shut in 489 by Zeno on account of its ‘Nestorian’ tendencies. During the 6th cent. Edessa suffered the consequences of warfare between Byzantines and Sasanians some of which are vividly recorded in the so-called Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Yeshuʿ the Stylite</ref>. In about 542 the city had a bishop named <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref> (d. 578), who, with the support of the Empress <ref type="cr">Theodora</ref>, undertook the reorganization of the Miaphysite community in Syria into the Syr. Orth. Church that survives to this day. In 641 Edessa was conquered by the Arabs and in 1098 it became a Crusader principality to be crushed by Zengi of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> in 1144. The Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> contains a dramatic report of the massacres that accompanied the fall of the city and a lamentation over it was composed by <ref type="cr">Dionysios Bar Ṣalibi</ref> bp. of <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>. From 1517 Edessa became part of the Ottoman empire, and during World War I some of its Syriac and Armenian inhabitants were massacred, a fact that led the remnants to leave the city once for all in 1924, heading to <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> where they still live in Hay al-Suryān ‘Quarter of the Syriacs’. Edessa was a Syr. Orth. Metropolitan seat probably from the early 6th cent. and as late as 1924.</p>

<p>The School of Edessa, or the School of the Persians in Edessa, as it is referred to by the earlier and more reliable sources, seems to have been one of several intellectual circles in 5th-cent. <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (‘Acts of the Council of Ephesus of 449’, ed. Flemming, 24.22–4). Its appellation and the background of those persons immediately associated with it in the sources suggest an originally ethnically-based institution, which in time, perhaps due to the influx of Christians from the East and the changing theological standards in the West, became the center of a more conservative Antiochene theology. The works of the so-called Nestorian fathers, such as <ref type="cr">Diodore of Tarsus</ref> and <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, were translated by those associated with the school (as evidenced in Letter 14 of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>). The school was closed in 489 under the auspices of the bp. Qiyore by order of the emperor Zeno, at which (or slightly earlier) point its members migrated into the Persian empire, some of them, most notably <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>, founding the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> (the date has been disputed in the secondary literature).</p>
<p>The standard view of the School of Edessa in modern scholarship has suffered from an uncritical reading of the sources and an anachronistic understanding of what kind of institution the term ‘school’ may have referred to in antiquity (e.g. Vööbus). Scholarship has attributed greater significance to the school than it perhaps deserves, arguing, for example, that commentaries on <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref> were composed and studied therein (e.g., on <ref type="cr">Proba</ref>, see Vööbus, 104–5) and extending its history back to the time of <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref> (d. 222) by using the title ‘School of Edessa’ more broadly to refer to intellectual activity in the city of Edessa in general (e.g. Hayes 1930; more recently, Drijvers 1995). Furthermore, a tradition developed from early on that <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> taught in and even founded the school. All but one of the sources for the school derive from after its closure and thus reflect the ongoing controversy between the W. Syrians, for whom the school was a source of heresy, and the E. Syrians, who understood it as the intellectual predecessor of the School of Nisibis. The question remains unresolved as to how much continuity there was between the School of Nisibis and that of Edessa. The two richest sources for the School of Edessa, ‘The Cause of the Foundation of the Schools’ and the Ecclesiastical History, both attributed to a <ref type="cr">Barḥadbshabba</ref> (perhaps the same person — the question of the identity of these two authors is not resolved), were composed at the School of Nisibis and describe the development of the school in the 5th  cent.; however, inconsistencies between these two texts suggest that their knowledge of this predecessor institution is hazy.</p>

<Author>A. H. Becker</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Eli of Qarṭmin</head><ab type="infobox"/>(ca. 13th cent.) [Syr. Orth.]
<p>Monastic author of a verse biography of <ref type="cr">Philoxenos</ref> <ref type="cr">of</ref> <ref type="cr">Mabbug</ref> (445–523), who had become the patron saint of the monastery of Qarṭmin (20 km. southeast of <ref type="cr">Midyat</ref>). Nothing is known of the author, except that he is a member of the monastic community at Qarṭmin. References in the text imply that he was a priest and probably wrote the <i>mimro</i> during the 13th cent.</p>
<p>The <i>mimro</i> survives in a single ms., Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 377, ff. 219r–241v. The ms. was copied in 1855, belonging to <ref type="cr">Addai Scher</ref>, before being acquired by the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.</p>
<p>The <i>mimro</i> is a panegyric composed in honor of Philoxenos and read on the occasion of one of the three annual commemorations at the Miaphysite monastery of Qarṭmin (lines 343–8): 1. Ordination to the episcopacy, 18 August; 2. Death, 10 December; 3. Translation, 18 February.</p>
<p>The modern editor, André de Halleux, divides the <i>mimro</i> into two parts: 1. (vv. 1–24) Introduction; (vv.  25–290) Life of Philoxenos; (vv. 291–332) Passion and martyrdom of Philoxenos — suffocation in bathhouse at Gangra; (vv. 333–68) Translation of Philoxenos’s remains to Qarṭmin and Midyat; 2. (vv. 369–410) Narrative of a posthumous miracle, dated 1144/5, when raiders attacked and pillaged <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, emptying the bones and head of Philoxenos on the road. A column of light appeared from the remains; (vv. 411–504) Elegy paralleling the life and achievements of Philoxenos with various Biblical characters; (vv. 505–550) Invocation to Philoxenos for patronage over Ṭur ʿAbdin; (vv. 551–4) Closing doxology.</p>
<p>De Halleux concludes that Eli’s biographical details are only as good as his sources from such a distance in time, and while there are numerous errors, Eli’s focus on Philoxenos’s relationship with Ṭur ʿAbdin deserves attention.</p>
<p>Philoxenos’s connection with Ṭur ʿAbdin is tied to three locations: 1. the monastery at Qarṭmin at Dayr al-ʿUmr where his body is interred; 2. the monastery of Mar Abraham, near Midyat, where his head was reputedly transferred in 1144/5; 3. Beth Severianos (Bāsebrīna), in the vicinity of which Philoxenos is said to have constructed a stone cell for himself (vv. 505–6).</p>
<p>The <i>mimro</i> relates two significant events in the life of Philoxenos that connect him to Qarṭmin: the miraculous encounter with the stylite Abel when Abel’s column bent down to meet Philoxenos (vv. 99–118); and his correspondence with bp. Yuḥanon of Amid (vv.  231–54), both of whom were said to be fellow novices with Philoxenos at Qarṭmin. Both, according to de Halleux, while being problematic historically, give evidence of genuine encounters.</p>
<p>De Halleux appended a short <i>qolo</i> on the martyrdom of Philoxenos, entitled ‘For the definition of the faith’ (ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 165, f. 237v.), eight verses in Ephrem’s meter (two hemistichs of heptasyllabic verse). He also pointed out the possible connection of the <i>mimro</i>with a biographical notice on Philoxenos preserved in ms. Vat. Syr. 155 (CSCO 234, I n. 2).</p>

<p>Teacher of biblical interpretation and director of the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> in the 1st or 3rd decade of 6th cent. The last part of Elishaʿ’s name has not yet been satisfactorily explained. <ref type="cr">Barḥadbshabba ʿArbaya</ref> calls him ‘Elishaʿ ʿArbaya bar Quzbane (<i>sic</i>)’ (ed. F. Nau). The Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref> introduces him as a fellow student of <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref> at the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref>. He is said to have been the director at the School of Nisibis, but the sources are divided as to whether he was the immediate successor of Narsai (d 502/3) or whether he served as director twenty years later, when <ref type="cr">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref> was temporarily removed from that position. Regardless, he was an old man when he became director, and his tenure was relatively short, 4 or 7 years.</p>
<p>Barḥadbshabba ʿArbaya ascribes to Elishaʿ an apologetic work written in response to criticism (<i>zeṭeme</i>) by the Magi. This may be the same work which, according to the Chronicle of Siirt, Elishaʿ composed on the Christian religion and which Cath. <ref type="cr">Aqaq</ref> translated into Persian before submitting it to the Persian emperor Qawad. The sources also mention didactic writings and biblical commentaries. The Chronicle of Siirt singles out commentaries on the Pauline letters, Job, Joshua, Judges, and Samuel (for which book Elishaʿ is said to have completed the commentary of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>). None of Elishaʿ’s complete works survive, but two brief comments on Job are quoted by <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, under the simple name Elishaʿ. The 
Chronicle of Siirt also ascribes to him a book on ‘the cause of the setting of the <i>mawtbā</i> (Arab. <i>al-mawtib</i>; perhaps “academic session”) in the school’, a title that links the work to a well-known work by the author who is known as Barḥadbshabba of Ḥalwan (published by A. Scher).</p>

<p>Bp. of Ṭirhan; Cath., author. After having been bp. of Tirhan, Eliya was consecrated Cath. in 1028. Prior to becoming bp. he wrote his influential Syriac grammar, aimed at students accustomed to the system of grammars of Arabic. He also may be the author of three treatises on accents and diacritics. As Cath. he ordered the introduction of some new liturgical practices, such as the Service of the Genuflection (<i>Syām burk</i><i>ā</i>) on Pentecost. He most likely is responsible for the final redaction of the great E.-Syr. <ref type="cr">Synodicon</ref>, and he issued several canons in the field of hereditary law, possibly written in Arabic and translated into Syriac. Ṣalībā b. Yuhannā, the compiler of the theological encyclopedia <i>Asfār al-asrār</i>, attributes to him a theological handbook in Arabic (<i>Kitāb us</i><i></i><i>ūl al-dīn</i>), which, however, on the basis of internal criticism, must be the work of a later author.</p>

<p>Patr. (1917–32), and a local saint in Malankara. The son of a priest, he was born in <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> and christened Naṣri. He worked as a shoemaker during his teens, then joined <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> in 1887. He became a monk in 1889 upon which he was renamed Eliya. He was ordained priest in 1892, and consecrated bp. of <ref type="cr">Amid</ref> in 1908. In 1912, he was transferred to <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> where he served until his election to the patriarchate in 1917. He held the <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>Synod in 1930. At the invitation of Lord Irwin, the British Viceroy to India, and appeals from the local clergy, Eliya visited Malankara in 1931 to resolve the dispute there, but died before completing his mission. He was buried outside of the Church of Mor Sṭephanos. Later, Dayro d-Mor Ignatius was built on the burial site. His tomb has become a pilgrimage center. At the recommendation of the local Malankara Synod, Patr. Zakka I issued a bull in 1987 granting permission to add Eliya’s name to the 5th Diptych, after the name of Mor Adai, along with the names of Maph. Yaldo and Bp. Gregorios of Parumala, effectively declaring him a ­local saint. This bull is published in <i>PatMagDam</i> 26 (1988), 66–72; the corresponding bull bears no. E 265/87. His feast day is 13 Feb.</p>

<p>Author of a Life of <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Tella</ref>. No information about Eliya is available outside the Life itself. Eliya claims to have lived with Yuḥanon and, in addition, to have received information from Yuḥanon’s mother. He may, therefore, have been a monk from Kallinikos, like Yuḥanon himself. The Persian capture of the city in 542, to which the author refers as the ‘rod of the Assyrian’ (cf. Is. 10:5), serves as the <i>terminus post quem</i> for the composition of the Life.</p>
<p>The Life has been called ‘a masterpiece of Syriac literature, with a prose of elegant simplicity’ (Harvey, 34). In Europe it exists in three W.-Syr. mss.: Berlin Syr. 26 (Sachau 321, 8th cent.), Brit. Libr. Add. 14,622 (9th  cent., incomplete), and Brit. Libr. Add. 12,174 (dated 1197, written for <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref>). It was first edited by H. G. Kleyn in 1882, on the basis of the two Brit. Libr. mss. (with DT) and again by E. W.  Brooks in 1907, using all three European mss. (with LT). A   fourth witness has been identified by Palmer in 
ms. 12/18 of the Syr. Orth. Patriarchate in Damascus (late 12th  cent.).</p>
<p>Kleyn’s suggestion that Eliya might be identical with Eliya of Dara, whose life was written by <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> (but survives only very imperfectly), was rejected by Brooks for lack of evidence. Yuḥanon of Ephesus, in his ‘Lives of the Eastern Saints’, wrote a (much shorter) Life of Yuḥanon of Tella (ed. E. W. Brooks, in PO 18, 513–26), but this is quite different from Eliya’s; whether Yuḥanon of Ephesus knew and used Eliya’s work remains uncertain.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Eliya of al-Anbār</head><ab type="infobox"/>(first half of the 10th cent.) 
[Ch. of E.] 
<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">al-Anbār</ref> and composer of didactic poetry in the first half of the 10th cent. There are three sources about his life and writings: 1. The ‘Chronology’ of <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (d. 1046) notes that Eliya was in (probably dogmatic) conflict with the Cath. Abraham III al-Abrāzā (906–37) in the year 1233 of the Greeks (= AD 921–22); 2. According to the ‘Book of the Tower’ (<i>Kitāb al-Majdal</i>, ed. H. Gismondi) Eliya was ‘unique in his time by knowledge and virtue’ and elected Cath. in 938. But the Caliph’s approval was withdrawn after his secretary was offended by Eliya shortly before the inthronisation; 
3. <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (d. 1318) in his ‘Catalogue’ of Syriac writers attributes to Eliya metrical discourses in three volumes, homilies, letters, and an apology. Moreover, Eliya of Nisibis claims that his ‘Chronology’ is a continuation of the one by Eliya, which he cites twice (286 and 287 A.H.).</p>
<p>Only the discourses survived, a voluminous collection of didactic (heptasyllabic) poetry known as <i>Ktābā d-Durrāšā</i> ‘Book of Exercise’ or by its popular name <i>Ktābā</i><i> d-Ma</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>wātā</i> ‘Book of Centuries’. The book is divided into three parts with a total of ten <i>memre</i> and 3,000 stanzas, organized in 30 centuries. It is a manual of ‘theoria’ based on scripture (typology), tradition (doctrine, heresies), and nature (profane knowledge), directing the reader to the Trinity, the world to come, and salvation history by unfolding symbols (<i>rāze</i>, <i>ṭupse</i>) and their explanations (<i>theoriai</i>). The elaborate structure of the book reflects the celestial hierarchy of <ref type="cr">Dionysius the Areopagite</ref>, enlarged by a tenth rank of the human beings. Purification, illumination, and perfection by participating in the knowledge of the angelic ranks is the mystical idea behind this symbolism.</p>
<p>There was a second E.-Syr. bp. of al-Anbār by the name of Eliya during the reign of Patr. Mari bar Ṭobi (987–99).</p>

[Ch. of E.] 
<p>Metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> and author. Eliya d-Ṣoba or bar Shinaya was born in Shenna (North Iraq) and studied in the St. Michael’s monastery near <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>. In 1002, he was ordained bp. of <ref type="cr">Beth Nuhadra</ref> and, in 1008, metropolitan of Nisibis. The majority of Eliya’s works were written in Arabic. His Chronography (<i>maktbānut zabne</i>) is bilingual, Arabic and Syriac, and consists of two parts: Part I opens with lists of names of secular and ecclesiastical leaders, followed by a chronological series of mostly short entries on ecclesiastical and political events, covering the years AD 25–1018, with careful indication of Syriac (East and West) and Muslim-Arabic sources. Part II consists of conversion tables of feasts and years according to different eastern calendars.</p>
<p>The report of his discussions with Abū al-Qāsim al-Maghribī, minister at the court of the Marwānids in Diyarbakır (see <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>), though written in Arabic, is important because of Eliya’s reflections on the <ref type="cr">Syriac language</ref> and culture. He tries to demonstrate the superiority of the Syriac language with a number of syntactical and lexicographical arguments as well as by referring to the fact that the Muslims have many scientific works translated from Syriac, whereas the Syrians do not have a single science borrowed from the Arabs. His argumentation is partly based on observations made by <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> in the 9th cent. and is no longer valid for his own period. His remark about the absence of translations of Arabic among the Syrians is contradicted by his chronicle which gives Syriac translations of fragments of Arabic historiographical works. He also argues that the Syriac<ref type="cr"> script</ref> is ‘more beautiful, accurate and useful’ than the Arabic script. We may have an example of his own Syriac handwriting in the only surviving ms. of his chronicle, ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 7197, written as early as 1019. His interest in Syriac grammar — and the relation between Syriac and Arabic — also appears from his Syriac-Arabic dictionary and Syriac grammar.</p>
<p>Eliya of Nisibis was also active in the field of liturgical poetry, which became partly inserted into later liturgical compilations such as the ‘Abū Ḥalīm’ or the book of <ref type="cr">Gewargis Warda</ref>. According to <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ of Nisibis</ref>, Eliya is also the author of a no longer extant four-volume canonical collection in Syriac; the part on the law of inheritance is preserved in an Arabic translation by ʿUbaydallāh b. Bakhtishūʿ. His interest in canonical matters also appears from his Letter on the election of Cath. <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb IV</ref>. Other letters, in Syriac and Arabic, ascribed to him by ʿAbdishoʿ of Nisibis, are lost.</p>

<p>Monk in the Upper Monastery (<i>Dayrā ʿell</i><i>āytā</i>) near <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, author of a Hexaemeron, which is still unpublished. Biographical data on Emmanuel are almost completely lacking. The Hexaemeron is a metrical work, partly in twelve- and partly in seven-syllable meter, on the creation of the world and on salvation history. In the 13  mss. of the work known today, 28 <i>memre</i> are listed. However, the first <i>memrā</i> (Incipit: <i>urḥā ḥdattā</i>) is also transmitted under <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>’s name (no. 81 in Macomber’s list) and most likely belongs to him. The second <i>memrā</i> is missing in all mss. It is only from the third <i>memrā</i> onwards, therefore, that Emmanuel’s authorship is well established. In the first part of the work (up to <i>memrā</i> 15), creation is described in great detail. Discussions on the creation of the angels, on original sin, punishment, and Sabbath rest are included, as well as a number of scientific digressions on anatomy, natural science, astronomy, and meteoro­logy. The second part, consisting of <i>memre</i>16 to 28, is more theological in nature and focuses on salvation and the New Adam. Excerpts from Emmanuel’s work are quoted in the 15th-cent. Prose Commentary of <ref type="cr">Isḥaq Shbadnaya</ref>.</p>
<p>The title ‘Book of the six days’ (<i>Ktāb</i><i>ā d-eštat yawme</i>) places this work in the longstanding tradition of Greek and Syriac writings on the Hexaemeron, the six days of Creation. The incorporation of data derived from secular sciences was a common characteristic of the later Syriac tradition, witnessed, e.g., in <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>’s Hexaemeron. As an exegete and theologian, Emmanuel was familiar with the theological and exegetical views of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>; however, Narsai was his more direct model, not only as an early Syriac transmitter of Theodore’s teachings, but also as the main E.-Syr. master of the metrical homily. At the same time, Emmanuel should be seen as a representative of the E.-Syr. school tradition of his day.</p>
<p>Other compositions transmitted under Emmanuel’s name include a <i>memrā</i> on the sacrament of baptism (in the seven-syllable meter, ed. J. Ishaq, <i>Bayn al-Nahrayn</i> 14.42 [1983], 33–66), and a Hymn on Mary, preserved in the <i>Ḥudr</i><i>ā</i>.</p>

<p>A monastic district southwest of Alexandria (Egypt) on the coastal road to Cyrene (Libya) which flourished esp. in the 5th to 7th cent. It was called ‘The Enaton’ (i.e. ‘The Ninth’) after the ninth milestone from Alexandria (Greek <i>ennea</i> ‘nine’). The Enaton served as a relay-post for travellers to and from Alexandria, to the monasteries of the Nitrian Desert, the Kellia, and the Scetis and shared in the permanent circulation of pilgrims, tourists, and merchants. A part of its own population was of international provenance. The district was a conglomeration of autonomous monasteries and cells of varying size and identifications of their own (e.g., the ‘Three Cells’ of Abba Zenon, the Monastery of ‘the Fathers’, of ‘Salomon’, of the ‘Antonines’). The ‘History of the Patriarchs’ (ed. B. Evetts [PO 1; 1948], 472) gives the number of six hundred monasteries, which might rather be true for the total of monasteries in the region of Alexandria. A sort of federal constitution is reflected by the election of a common <i>hegumenos</i> (in the ‘Life’ of Longinus, ed. R. Basset [PO 11, 1916], 764–7).</p>
<p>The origins of the Enaton are shrouded in darkness. When Longinus became <i>hegumenos</i> in the mid–5th cent., it had been in existence for a long time. His ‘Life’ presents him and the monks of the East as fervent opponents of the Council of Chalcedon (451), and this theological feature dominated in the time to follow (though ca. 542/3 there was a period when the monks of the Enaton followed the decisions of Chalcedon and received a theological tract from the Emperor Justinian  I). Miaphysitism was established in 453 when the monks of the monastery of <ref type="cr">Peter the Iberian</ref> at Maïuma/Gaza in Palestine were expelled and took refuge in the Enaton. Notable Miaphysite refugees were <ref type="cr">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref> and <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> after his deposition (518), who died in Egypt (538) and was buried in the Enaton; and <ref type="cr">Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref> (Bp. of Mabbug) together with <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Tella</ref> after the expulsion from their sees in 599. As the Coptic Miaphysite patriarchs could not reside in the Melkite (Chalcedonian) Alexandria, the Enaton was the appropriate place for them to stay (Peter IV, Damian).</p>
<p>The quasi-autonomous status of this monastic district in which the multi-national population intermingled with emigrants, expelled bishops, and fugitive patriarchs yielded a fertile milieu of theological controversy and negotiation. This milieu helped bring about a settlement, in 616, of the schism between the Coptic and Syriac ­Miaphysites (Maspero, ‘Histoire des Patriarches’, chap.  x), which dated from the time of Pope Damian (578–606) and the Patr. <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref> (581–91). The Enaton is not expressly mentioned, but no doubt this location brought together the leaders Anastasios (Apozygarios, 607–619) and <ref type="cr">Athanasios I Gamolo</ref> of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> (594–631) who both had no access to Alexandria. This reunion was based on extensive philological work on the Holy Scriptures, which took place in the Enaton in the monastery ‘of the Antonines’ (cf. Honigmann, <i>Év</i><i>êques</i>, 238) and was favored by the vicinity of Alexandria with its philological traditions and resources. Pawlos of Tella provided a translation of the Septuagint (‘<ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref>’), and Tumo of Ḥarqel a translation of the NT (<ref type="cr">Ḥarqlean version</ref>). According to the subscriptions of the Ḥarqlean Gospels (Hatch, <i>The Subscription</i>), Acts, and Pauline epistles this translation was executed ‘at the Enaton of (i.e. near) Alexandria, the great city, in the holy Convent of the Antonines (…) in the year 927 of Alexander, in the fourth indiction’ (i. e., 615/16), while the subscriptions of the ‘Syro-Hexapla’ refer to the progress of the work between 615/17 (Vööbus, <i>The Hexapla</i>, 36–44). Shortly after the completion of the translation work the Persians invaded Egypt and sacked the Enaton in 619. A visit of Alexandria is reported for <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, who thoroughly revised the OT. The Enaton is not mentioned, but the location ‘Alexandria’ does not necessarily exclude this monastic district.</p>

<Author>A. Juckel</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Ephrem</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. 373) 
<p>Deacon, poet, and theologian. Born probably of Christian parents in the early years of the 4th cent. in the region of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, he spent most of his life in Nisibis, serving a series of bishops (beginning with <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref>, d. 338). As part of the peace treaty between the Roman and Persian Empires in 363, Nisibis was handed over to the Persians and the Christian population had to leave. Ephrem may have gone first to <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>, but ended up settling in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, where he spent the last ten years of his life. He probably died on 9 June 373. His biography, written perhaps 200 years after his death, is full of unreliable information (see <ref type="cr">Ephrem, Life of</ref>).</p>
<p>Ephrem’s genuine writings fall into four main categories, prose, artistic prose, stanzaic poetry (<i>madrāše</i>), and 7+7 syllable couplets (<i>memre</i>).</p>
<p>1. Prose: Commentary on Genesis and part of Exodus (ed. R. M. Tonneau, CSCO 152–3); Commentary on the Diatessaron (ed. L. Leloir, 1963, 1990), whose final editing was probably after his death; Commentaries on Acts and the Pauline Letters which only survive in Armenian translation; various works against <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>, <ref type="cr">Marcion</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Mani</ref> (ed. C. Mitchell and F. C. Burkitt, <i>Prose Refutations</i>, I–II [1912, 1921]).</p>
<p>2. Artistic prose: <i>memrā</i> on our Lord (ed. Beck, CSCO 270–1); Letter to Publius (ed. S. P. Brock, <i>LM</i>89, 1976); <i>memrā</i> on the signs performed by Moses in Egypt (ed. Overbeck, <i>S. Ephraemi ... Opera Selecta</i> [1865], 88–94).</p>
<p>3. <i>Madrāše</i> (‘<i>Hymni</i>’). Nearly 400 <i>madrāše</i> survive, using some 50 different metrical patterns, designated by their melody titles (<i>qāle</i>). According to <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, Ephrem instituted women’s choirs to sing his <i>madrāše</i>. These are transmitted in collections of various sizes, and are all edited by E. Beck: on the Church (CSCO 198–9); on the Crucifixion (CSCO 248–9); on Faith (CSCO 212–3); on the Fast (CSCO 246–7); against Heresies (CSCO 169–70); against Julian the Apostate (CSCO 174–5); on the Nativity (CSCO 186–7); of the Nisibenes (CSCO 218–9, 240–1); on Paradise (CSCO 174–5); on the Resurrection (CSCO 248–9); on Unleavened Bread (CSCO 248–9); and on Virginity (CSCO 222–3). Collections attributed to Ephrem, but which largely contain <i>madrāš</i><i>e</i> that must be slightly later, are: on Abraham of Qidun and Yulyana Saba (ed. Beck, CSCO 322–3); on the Confessors (ed. Beck, CSCO 363–4); on Epiphany (ed. Beck, CSCO 186–7).</p>
<p>4. <i>Memre</i> (‘<i>Sermones</i>’). Since the seven-syllable metre, used by Ephrem, became known as the ‘meter of Mar Ephrem’, a large number of <i>memre</i>, certainly not by Ephrem, came to be attributed to him. The six <i>memre</i> on Faith (ed. Beck, CSCO 212–3) are definitely genuine. Of the four further collections of <i>memre</i> edited by Beck (<i>Sermones</i> I–IV, CSCO 305–6, 311–2, 320–1, 334–5), only the following are considered by him to be genuine: I, 1–3; II, 1 (on Jonah and Nineveh) and the core of 4 (On the Sinful Woman, Luke 7); and IV, 2 (perhaps). All the rest in these volumes date from times later than Ephrem; this also applies to <i>memre</i> in Beck’s further volumes, CSCO 363–4 (<i>Nachträge</i>) and 412–3 (on Holy Week). Only some excerpts from a collection of <i>memre</i> on Nicomedia survive in Syriac, but a complete Armenian translation preserves it (ed. C. Renoux, PO 37, 2–3).</p>
<p>The dating of Ephrem’s writings, to before or after his move from Nisibis in 363, for the most part remains uncertain. Very probably composed before 363 are the <i>memre</i> on Faith, the <i>madrāše</i> on Paradise, and at least most of the Nisibene collection (the first can be dated exactly, since it describes the flooding of the surroundings during the siege of Nisibis in 350). The <i>madrāše</i> against ­Julian must date from shortly after the emperor’s death in 363, during his Persian campaign. It would seem reasonable to date with confidence to his Edessan period those works which include references to Bardaiṣan (Prose Refutations, <i>madrāše</i> against Heresies); likewise the <i>madrāš</i><i>e</i> on Faith, many of which are concerned with the later developments of Arianism.</p>
<p>The <i>madrāše</i> collections are preserved in 6th-cent. mss. (not always quite complete). This is fortunate since later mss. (almost all liturgical) provide only excerpts, often mixed in with later material; furthermore they attribute to Ephrem numerous poems which are certainly not by him (see <i>Studia Patristica</i> 33 [1997], 490–505). An important clue to the early transmission of the collections is provided by an early index of <i>qāle</i> (ed. A. de Halleux, <i>LM</i>85 [1972], 171–99). Three of the six-volume Roman edition of Ephrem’s works (1732–6) provided the first printed edition of his works in Syriac (the other volumes contain texts in Greek). In the 19th cent. editions of further works were published by Overbeck (1865), Bickell (1866), and especially Lamy (I–IV, 1882–1902). These older editions are now almost entirely replaced, as far as genuine works are concerned, by the 20th-century editions of Beck and others (a guide to all these editions is given in <i>The Harp</i> 3 [1990], 7–29; in <i>S. Ephrem, un poè</i><i>te pour notre temps</i>, 281–307; and in the Russian Theological Encyclopaedia [under Ephrem]).</p>
<p>Ephrem was already known outside Syriac circles to <ref type="cr">Epiphanius</ref> (‘Panarion’, 51.22.7: ‘the sage among the Syrians’) and to Jerome (‘On Famous Men’, 115, written in 392), and translations of some of his works into Greek were soon made. Ephrem’s fame, however, led to a large number of Greek texts being attributed to him, only a few of which are really by him (and many are not even translations from Syriac); <i>CPG</i> 3905–4175 provides a guide to these. Translations were made from Greek into Latin, Slavonic, and other languages; those into Armenian, however, were directly from Syriac.</p>
<p>Ephrem was also a profound thinker, preferring to express his theological vision through poetry, rather than prose. Though his importance for the Christian tradition as a whole was recognised by Pope Benedict XV in 1920, when he proclaimed Ephrem to be a Doctor of the Universal Church, it is only in fairly recent years that his significance as a theologian has begun to be properly appreciated.</p>
<p>The iconographical tradition either depicts him as a deacon (thus on a 10th-cent. icon at <ref type="cr">St. Catherine’s Monastery</ref>, Sinai), or (more frequently) as a monk, following the misleading 6th-century Life. A popular theme in Late Byzantine art was the Death of St. Ephrem.</p>
<p>The dates of his liturgical commemorations vary in the different Churches. Syr. Orth., Saturday of the 1st week of Lent (with St. Theodore); also 28 Jan. and 19 Feb.; Maron., 27 Jan.; Ch. of E., Friday of 5th week after Epiphany (Syriac Doctors). Greek and Russian Orthodox, 28 Jan. Roman Catholic, 9 June.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Ephrem, Life of</LemmaTitle> 
<p><ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>(d. 373) is universally acknowledged as the greatest writer in Syriac literary culture. However, the earliest biographical notices of Ephrem did not emerge from the Syriac-speaking world, but were the work of Greek ecclesiastical historians (Palladius, Sozomen, <ref type="cr">Theodoret</ref>) who created an image intended to conform to their own monastic-inspired ascetical values. The accounts they produced preserve practically no reliable information about Ephrem; rather, they are constructed from a stereotypical repertoire of anecdotes and stories intended to depict an ideal monk. Monasticism had not entered Syria in Ephrem’s time. His dedication to an evangelical life of chastity and service was based on the native Syriac institution of the <ref type="cr">Bnay qyāmā</ref> ‘Sons of the Covenant’ which flourished in the pre-monastic period of Syriac asceticism.</p>
<p>It is clear that the purpose of the early Greek biographical sketches of Ephrem was to confer legitimacy on him from the point of view of the Great Church of the Byzantine Empire, for example, by fictitiously associating him with <ref type="cr">Basil</ref> the Great, Father of Byzantine monasticism, and with monastic foundations in Egypt. These fictional encounters tactlessly depict Ephrem as a social inferior and an unlettered country-bumpkin whose fondest desire is to be able to speak Greek. It is during Ephrem’s fictitious visit to Basil that his purported ordination to the diaconate takes place. By conferring clerical status on Ephrem, his teaching authority is legitimized and sanctioned. As a provincial, non-Greek-speaking culture with a history of independent thought and practice, Syriac-speaking Christianity represented a deviation from Byzantine imperial hegemony. By authorizing Ephrem, the Byzantine ecclesiastics who produced the Life brought him into the fold and legitimized the authority he possessed in native Syriac culture.</p>
<p>A historically and culturally accurate depiction of Ephrem is found in a <i>memrā</i> by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> dedicated to Ephrem. The homily knows nothing of the severe ascetic depicted in the Life who shuns everyday life and disparages women as inferiors. On the contrary, it celebrates Ephrem for his moderation (<i>puršānā</i>) and simplicity (<i>šapyutā</i>), and remembers him precisely for his work among the <i>Bnāt qyāmā</i> ‘Daughters of the Covenant’.</p>
<p>The several ms. traditions of the Life of Ephrem are all based on three Syriac recensions which, in order of length are: ms. Vat. Syr. 117; ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 235; and ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 9384.</p>

<p>Christianity reached the Kingdom of Aksum, on the northern edge of the great Ethiopian plateau, by the reign of ʿĒzānā in the middle of the 4th cent. According to Rufinus (4th cent.), the introduction of Christianity was facilitated by a certain Frumentius from Tyre (later known in the Ethiopic tradition as Salāmā Kaśātē Berhān), who was ordained bp. of ‘India’ (i.e. Ethiopia) by <ref type="cr">Athanasius of Alexandria</ref>. In the 6th cent., the traveler Cosmas Indicopleustes reported that there were a large number of churches in Ethiopia as well as numerous bishops, martyrs, and monks. In time, Ethiopic Christianity became associated with the Oriental Orthodox Churches, which include the Coptic, Armenian, <ref type="cr">Syriac Orthodox</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Malankara Syriac Orthodox</ref>Churches, all of which accept the Councils of Nicea, Constantinople, and Ephesus, but reject the Council of Chalcedon (see <ref type="cr">Ecumenical dialogue</ref>). Throughout its history, Ethiopic Christianity has had various contacts with Syriac Christianity. In general, the influence of Ethiopic Christianity on Syriac Christianity seems to have been rather limited, though it was certainly not non-existent. The influence of Syriac Christianity on Ethiopic Christianity, on the other hand, was more substantial. This influence can be divided into two basic time periods: the Aksumite Period (4th cent. – ca. 900) and the Solomonic Period (1270–1770).</p>
<label type="subsection">The Aksumite Period</label>
<p>In the scholarly literature, a great deal of attention has been focused on possible Syriac influences on Ethiopic Christianity in the Aksumite period. Although Christianity reached Ethiopia in the 4th cent., the spread of Christianity throughout Ethiopia is traditionally attributed to the efforts of a group of foreign missionaries active in the late 5th to early 6th cent. These missionaries include the Ṣādeqān, Maṭāʿ, and especially the so-called Nine Saints (see A. Brita, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 3, 1188–91). 
A number of scholars, including I. Guidi (1888, 33–4 with n. 1; 1932, 13–5) and especially C. Conti Rossini (1928, esp. 155–65), have argued that these foreign missionaries originated from Syriac-speaking areas. Based on this connection, a theory was developed that attributed a great deal of Syriac influence to the development of Christianity in Ethiopia, including the introduction of monasticism as well as the translation of the Bible into Geʿez, the classical language of Ethiopic Christianity. The association of these missionaries with Syriac-speaking areas was based on three principal arguments, all of which have been seriously challenged in more recent scholarship.</p>
<p>First, it was argued that the personal names of the missionaries and the geographical names from which they are said to originate are of Syriac origin (Guidi 1888, 33–4 n. 1; Conti Rossini 1928, 161). More recently, however, Marrassini (1990, 35–8; 1999, 326–8) has shown that few, if any, of these names are actually of Syriac origin.</p>
<p>Second, it was proposed that the transcription of Greek names in Geʿez, especially in translations of the Bible, was based on the pattern of Aramaic (Guidi 1888, 33–34 n. 1; Conti Rossini 1928, 156). Marrassini (1990, 39–41; 1999, 329–30) has, however, pointed out that this pattern is not restricted to Aramaic, but rather it is the typical way in which Greek is transcribed in Semitic languages.</p>
<p>The third argument adduced in favor of Syriac influence on Ethiopic Christianity in the Aksumite period involves Syriac loanwords in Geʿez. More than a century ago, Th. Nöldeke drew attention to a number of <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> loanwords in Geʿez. Guidi (1932, 14) and especially Conti Rossini (1928, 155) argued that some of these Aramaic loanwords in Geʿez are more specifically of Syriac origin, e.g. Geʿez<i> hāymānot</i> ‘faith’ (often translating Greek <i>pístis</i>) from Syriac <i>haymānutā</i>. In an influential study, however, Polotsky showed that several of these Aramaic loanwords were not borrowed from Syriac, but rather from Jewish Aramaic, e.g. Geʿez <i>meṣwāt</i>‘alms, charity’ (no such word exists in Syriac) and Geʿez <i>ṭāʿot</i>‘idol’ (Syriac has <i>ṭāʿyutā</i>, which not only preserves the third root consonant <i>y</i>, but means ‘error, mistake’). Further research by Ullendorff (1967, 120–5), Witakowski (1989–90, 191–2; forthcoming), and Marrassini (1990, 38–9; 1999, 328–9) has raised additional questions about some of the purported Syriac loanwords in Geʿez while at the same time suggested several new possible examples. In the current state of research, it can only be conclusively stated that Geʿez contains a number of Aramaic loanwords, some of which are certainly not Syriac, but others of which may potentially be Syriac. Before any meaningful historical conclusions can be drawn, an updated analysis of all the Aramaic loanwords in Geʿez is needed, taking into account recent developments in Aramaic dialectology as well as the increasingly robust methodology of contact linguistics.</p>
<p>In the end, the evidence for significant Syriac influence on Ethiopic Christianity in the Aksumite period is rather slim. Nevertheless, it does seem all but certain that there were contacts between Ethiopic Christianity and Syriac Christianity at this time, especially given that the Aksumite kingdom was involved in various power struggles with South Arabian kingdoms in the Arabian Peninsula, a place where Syriac-speaking Christians are known to have resided. In one instance of particular importance to contacts between Syriac and Ethiopic ­Christianity, the Aksumite <i>neguś</i> Kālēb (fl. first half of the 
6th cent.) intervened against the king of <ref type="cr">Ḥimyar</ref> on behalf of miaphysite Christians who where being persecuted in <ref type="cr">Nagran</ref>(see recently Nebes).</p>
<label type="subsection">The Solomonic Period</label>
<p>Setting aside the problematic evidence of the Aksumite period, Syriac influence on Ethiopic Christianity can be firmly established for Geʿez literature from the Solomonic period. In this case, however, Syriac influence was almost always mediated by Arabic Christianity, which inherited a great deal from the Syriac heritage.</p>
<p>Alongside original compositions, Geʿez literature contains a significant body of translations which were made from Greek in the Aksumite period and from Arabic in the Solomonic period; there is little evidence for literary activity in the intervening time of the Zāg<sup>w</sup>ē dynasty (900–1270). In many cases, the Arabic literature was itself translated from Greek, Coptic, and Syriac. While there may be a few rare cases in which Syriac literature in Geʿez was translated directly from Syriac, in most cases Arabic was the bridge by which Syriac literature reached Ethiopic Christianity.</p>
<p>The Bible is the earliest piece of literature associated with Ethiopic Christianity. At least part of the Bible was already translated into Geʿez by the end of the 4th to the early 5th cent. as can be deduced from biblical quotations in the Aksumite inscriptions (Knibb, 46–54). Though there is now general consensus that the Geʿez OT and NT were both translated from Greek, a number of different <i>Vorlagen</i>, including Syriac, have been proposed throughout the history of scholarship. A. Vööbus, for instance, argued that the Geʿez Gospels were translated from Syriac and then revised against the Greek text. It is now clear, however, that Syriac influence on the Geʿez Bible occurred at a later stage (probably in the 14th cent.) when the Geʿez biblical text was revised against a Syriac biblical text or, more likely, an Arabic version of a Syriac biblical text (see Knibb, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 1, 565 and more extensively Knibb 1999). Evidence of interest in the comparison of Syriac and Ethiopic biblical texts (along with Coptic, Arabic, and Armenian) is found in ms. Vat. Barberini Or. 2, a 15th-cent. polyglot Psalter in five languages, which was owned by a Syr. Orth. priest named Ṣalib (see S. Brock, <i>The Bible in the Syriac tradition</i>[2nd ed. 2006], 145).</p>
<p>Moving beyond the Bible, a number of Syriac-speaking authors appear in Geʿez literature. Two demonstrations by <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref> (fl. 336–45) are found in the Ethiopic tradition (see W. Witakowski, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 1, 287). In 1906, F. M. Esteves Pereira published a Geʿez version of Dem. 5. In this text, the author is (incorrectly) identified as <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref>, an attribution which is also found in the earliest Syriac ms. of Aphrahaṭ (London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,182; dated 474), as well as in the Armenian translation. In 1964, E. Cerulli published a text on the resurrection of the dead, which was subsequently identified as a portion of Aphrahaṭ’s Dem. 8 by T. Baarda.</p>
<p>A number of Geʿez texts are attributed to <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> (d. 373), including both homilies and prayers (a list is provided by Weninger, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 1, 331–2); it is, however, unclear whether any of these are among Ephrem’s genuine writings. Several homilies attributed to Ephrem are extracted in the <i>Hāymānota ābaw</i>‘Faith of the Fathers’, which is a large compendium of patristic writings, synodical statements, and canons (unedited; see A.  Wion and E.  Fritsch, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 2, 1073–5 and Graf). In addition, Ephrem is said to have composed the <i>Weddāsē Mā</i><i>ryām</i>‘Praise of Mary’ (ed. with FT ­Velat), a collection of hymns to Mary for each day of the week, which is found in Ethiopic Psalter mss. as well as in the <i>Meʿerāf</i>, a liturgical text which forms part of the Divine Office. Due to his association with the <i>Weddāsē Māryām</i>, Ephrem is usually depicted in Ethiopic iconography standing at the feet of an enthroned Mary (see Hammerschmidt and Jäger, 101–8). Ephrem also sometimes bears the sobriquet <i>labḥāwi</i>‘the potter’ in the Ethiopic tradition, likely due to a conflation with <ref type="cr">Shemʿun Quqoyo</ref>.</p>
<p>The legend of Abgar V Ukkama (see <ref type="cr">Abgarids</ref>), which is found in Syriac in the <ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref>, exists in at least four Geʿez versions, two of which are associated with the <i>Ta</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>āmmera Iyasus</i>‘The miracles of Jesus’ (see Weninger, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 1, 40–41 and especially Haile). Most of the <i>Ta</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>āmmera Iyasus</i>consists of a translation of the Arabic Apocryphal Gospel of John (ed. with LT I. Galbiati, <i>Iohannis evangelium apocryphum arabice</i>[1957]), which is itself based on a variety of sources, including the <ref type="cr">Cave of Treasures</ref> and the <ref type="cr">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</ref> (see Witakowski 1995).</p>
<p>No less than twenty texts are attributed to <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (d. 521) in the Ethiopic tradition (inventories are provided in W. Witakowski, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 2, 263 and Uhlig 1999, 13–16). A majority of these belong to the genre of <i>dersān</i> ‘homily’, the Geʿez equivalent of Syriac <i>memr</i><i>ā</i>. While only one of these homilies has thus far been edited (Uhlig 1999), it seems that many of them were translated from Arabic, and at least some may go back to Syriac originals. Others, however, were only ascribed to Yaʿqub in the Geʿez ms. tradition, e.g. the <i>Dersāna sanbat</i> ‘Homily on the Sabbath’ (see Wurmbrand 1963). Interestingly, Yaʿqub’s<ref type="cr"></ref>‘Homily on the death of Aaron’ formed the basis for the <i>Mota</i><i><cCase:All Caps>ā</i><cCase:><i>ron</i>‘Death of Aaron’, a Geʿez text that is found not only in the literary tradition of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, but also in that of the Bēta Esrāʾēl (or Falāšā) (see Wurmbrand 1961). In addition to homilies, an anaphora, incipit ‘Stand up in the fear of the Lord’, is also attributed to Yaʿqub (ed. with GT Euringer), but again it is probably pseudonymous (see Hammerschmidt, 47–8).</p>
<p>A Profession of Faith attributed to <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref> (d. 578) is preserved in Geʿez in the <i>Hāymānota ābaw</i>(ed. with GT Cornill; see J. Tubach, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 3, 261–2). This text is not extant in Syriac, but is found in Arabic (ed. with DT H. G. Kleyn, <i>Jacobus Baradaeüs. De stichter der syrische monophysietische kerk</i>[1882], 121–63), from which the Geʿez was translated.</p>
<p>Geʿez preserves the ‘Conflict of Severus’ by <ref type="cr">Athanasios I Gamolo</ref> (d. 631) (ed. Goodspeed and Crum), which deals with the life of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref>(d. 538). Though not extant in Syriac, this text is found in Arabic as well as in Coptic fragments. Several texts attributed to Severus also exist in Geʿez, some of which may ultimately derive from Syriac originals (see Witakowski 2004).</p>
<p>Several Syriac authors feature prominently in the <i>Maṣḥafa manakosāt</i>‘Book of monks’, which is one of the central collections of Ethiopic monasticism (see A. Bausi, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 2, 997–9). This collection consists of three distinct texts, each of which is directly associated with at least one Syriac-speaking author. Included in the <i>Maṣḥafa manakosāt</i>is the <i>Ārag</i><i>āwi manfasāwi</i>‘Spiritual ­Elder’, which is the name by which the Ch. of E. mystical writer <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref> (8th cent.), or Yoḥannan Saba (‘Elder’), is known in Geʿez. The <i>Āragāwi manfasāwi</i>was translated from an Arabic version of Yoḥannan’s original Syriac composition (see E.  Lucchesi, in <i>EAe</i>, vol.  1, 309–10). Another text found in the <i>Maṣḥafa manakosāt</i>is the <i>Filkesyos</i>(see Witakowski 2006; idem, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 2, 541–2). Though attributed to the Syr. Orth. theologian<ref type="cr"> Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>(d. 523), the <i>Filkesyos</i> is actually a Geʿez version (via Arabic) of the commentary of <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref> (late 7th cent.) on the ‘Paradise of the Fathers’ by <ref type="cr">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref> (7th cent.). ʿEnanishoʿ’s work is in turn a large compilation of monastic texts, which includes <ref type="cr">Palladius</ref>’s ‘Lausiac history’, the ‘History of the monks in Egypt’, and various apophthegmata. The final book that makes up the <i>Maṣḥafa manakosāt</i>is the <i>Maṣḥafa Mār Yesḥaq</i>‘The book of Mar Isaac’ (ed. with GT Berhanu; see S. Weninger, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 2, 193–4). As the title suggests, this text is attributed to the famous Ch. of E. monastic author <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref> (late 7th cent.). More specifically, the <i>Maṣḥafa Mār Yesḥaq</i> is a Geʿez translation of the Arabic collection attributed to Isḥaq. The Arabic version is in turn a translation from a Greek version of writings attributed to Isḥaq, which consists of most of the ‘First Part’ of the original Syriac writings of Isḥaq as well as four homilies by Yoḥannan of Dalyatha and an abbreviated version of the ‘Letter to Patricius’ by Philoxenos of Mabbug. Thus, although the <i>Filkesyos</i>is incorrectly ascribed to Philoxenos, the <i>Maṣḥafa manakosāt</i> does still contain a text by this Syr. Orth. theologian. Outside of the <i>Maṣḥafa manakosāt</i>, Geʿez monastic literature preserves a number of sayings attributed to Syriac-speaking authors, including Ephrem, Yoḥannan of Dalyatha, and Isḥaq of Nineveh, in various collections of apophthegmata (ed. with LT Arras 1963, 1967, 1984, 1986, 1988).</p>
<p>Geʿez biblical exegesis has also been influenced by Syriac-speaking authors, especially those belonging to the Ch. of E., such as <ref type="cr">Aḥob Qaṭraya</ref> (late 6th cent.?), <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Koni</ref> (fl. end of the 8th cent.), <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (d.  828), and <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> (fl. ca. 850). This contact was mediated by the Christian Arabic tradition, in particular the exegetical works of <ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> 
(d. 1043), especially his <i>Firdaws al-naṣrāniyya</i>‘The Paradise of Christianity’. In its Geʿez version, E.-Syr. biblical exegesis was transmitted to the Andemta commentary tradition (Cowley 1983, 1988). The Andemta commentaries contain a translation of the Geʿez biblical text into Amharic, the official language of present-day Ethiopia, as well as a wealth of traditional exegetical material (Psalms ed. with ET Stoffregen Pedersen; Hosea ed. with IT Andeberhan). Several anonymous Syriac exegetical homilies are also extant in Geʿez. The Syriac verse homily on Abraham and Sarah in Egypt (ed. with ET S. P. Brock and S. Hopkins, ‘A verse homily on Abraham and Sarah in Egypt: Syriac original with early Arabic translation’, <i>LM</i> 105 [1992], 87–146), for instance, found its way via Arabic into Geʿez (ed. with FT Caquot), where it is attributed to Ephrem. Similarly, the Geʿez <i>Zenāhu la-Yosef</i>‘History of Joseph’ (ET Isaac; an edition of the Geʿez is in preparation by the current author) ultimately derives (via Arabic) from a Syriac version, which is attributed to <ref type="cr">Basil of Caesarea</ref> (see Heal; ed. M. Weinberg, <i>Die Geschichte Josefs angeblich verfasst von Basilius dem Grossen aus Caesarea</i> [1893]; S. W. Link, <i>Die Geschichte Josefs angeblich verfasst von Basilius dem Grossen aus Cäsarea</i> [1895]; K.  Heal, ‘A Missing leaf from the <i>Syriac History of Joseph</i>’, forthcoming).</p>
<p>Finally, a number of Syriac individuals appear in Geʿez hagiographic literature. The <i>Senkessar</i> ‘Synaxary’, for instance, commemorates, among others, Abgar V Ukkama, <ref type="cr">Barṣawmo</ref>, Ephrem (cf. Pérès), <ref type="cr">Marutha of Maypherqaṭ</ref>, <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>, and Yaʿqub of Nisibis (ed. with FT by various authors in PO; for full references, see Colin; ET Budge 1928). More developed hagiographic works, such as the Life of Barṣawmo<ref type="cr"></ref>(ed. with FT Grébaut), are also extant in Geʿez.</p>
<p>Among the many interesting aspects of this large body of Geʿez literature that is attributed to Syriac-speaking authors is the fact that several E.-Syr. authors are represented in the Ethiopic tradition, especially in texts related to biblical exegesis and monasticism. The appearance of these E.-Syr. authors is intriguing given that Ethiopic Christianity has throughout its history been dogmatically aligned with the Syr. Orth. Church, not with the Ch. of E. In some cases, a work by a 
Ch. of E. author seems to have been stripped of its ­distinctive E.-Syr. features before it passed into Geʿez. This is, for instance, the case with Ibn al-Ṭayyib’s ‘Commentary on the Gospels’, which is extant both in an original form as well as in an adapted, miaphysite version (ed. Y. Manquriyūs, <i>Tafsīr al-mašriqī</i> [1908–10]; see Faultless), which served as the textual basis for the Geʿez translation. In other cases, however, it is less clear how Syriac-speaking authors belonging to the Ch. of E. found their way into Geʿez.</p>
<p>In addition to the Geʿez literature that is attributed to Syriac-speaking authors, there are a number of originally Greek works that passed through Syriac on their way to the Ethiopic tradition, again almost always with Arabic standing in between. This is, for instance, likely the case with the <ref type="cr">Didascalia Apostolorum</ref>(ed. with ET Platt; ed. with ET Horner), the <ref type="cr">Testament of our Lord Jesus Christ</ref> (ed. with FT Beylot 1984), and several texts related to the <ref type="cr">Alexander cycle</ref> (ed. with ET Budge 1896; see G. Lusini, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 1, 195). Likewise, the Sayings of <ref type="cr">Aḥiqar</ref> seem to have traveled through Syriac (and then Arabic) on their way to the Ethiopic tradition, where they are transmitted in late mss. of the <i>Maṣḥafa falāsfa ṭabibān</i> ‘Book of the wise philosophers’ (see U. Pietruschka, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 2, 485–6). A similar trajectory is likely for the related narrative about Aḥiqar that is preserved in Geʿez (ed. with FT Schneider).</p>
<p>It is clear then that Geʿez literature from the Solomonic period, which includes a number of texts that are attributed to Syriac-speaking authors as well as texts that passed through Syriac on their way to Geʿez, provides an example of Syriac influence on Ethiopic Christianity. It must be stressed, however, that this Syriac influence was in most, if not all, cases mediated by Arabic Christianity.</p>
<p>The Syriac influence on Ethiopic Christianity in the Solomonic period can be explained by various points of contact. During the reign of Yekunno Amlāk (1270–85) at the beginning of the Solomonic period, it appears that a ‘Syrian’ became head of the Ethiopian Church, a position normally restricted to Coptic monks (see Tamrat, 69–72). Though this seems to have been short lived, it clearly demonstrates a Syriac presence in Ethiopia at this time. Outside of Ethiopia, contacts between Ethiopic and Syriac Christianity occurred at various locations. Ethiopic monks are known to have lived in several monastic communities in Egypt alongside Syriac monks (in general, see O. Meinardus, in <i>EAe</i>, vol. 2, 243–5). Both Syriac and Ethiopic monks also resided at the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref> (Cerulli, 1943–7, vol. 1, 148 and 151). In addition, contacts between Syriac and Ethiopic monks took place in <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>, where the various Christian communities were represented (Cerulli 1943–7). Finally, moving closer to the Syriac homeland, Ethiopic monks were present from the 13th cent. onwards in Lebanon and Syria, and some may have possibly played a role in the renaming of <ref type="cr">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>(‘Monastery of St. Moses the Ethiopian’) (Cerulli 1943–7, vol. 1, 325–33; Cruikshank Dodd, 19–25; Kaufhold, 54–9).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Euphemia and the Goth
</LemmaTitle><p>The narrative concerning Euphemia and the Goth, set in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> of 395/6, belongs to the genre of miracle stories connected with a shrine (in this case, the shrine of the local martyrs, Gurya, Shmona, and Ḥabib). It is transmitted in two Syriac hagiographical mss. (the older of which is of the 9th cent.), and is also to be found in Greek (ed. E. von Dobschutz, <i>Texte und Untersuchungen</i>, vol. 3 [1911], 37). The unknown author claims to have heard the story from the <i>paramonarios</i> ‘custodian’ of the shrine. At the time of an invasion of the region by Huns, a Goth in the Roman army in Edessa was billeted on a widow (Sophia) and her daughter (Euphemia). The Goth wants to marry Euphemia and eventually bullies Sophia into allowing this. When the time comes for the Goth to leave Edessa and take his new wife with him, Sophia takes them to the Shrine of the Confessors and gets him to swear that he will not harm her daughter. Once they have left Edessa, it emerges that the man already has a wife, and he treats Euphemia as a slave girl. When Euphemia gives birth to a child, the Goth’s wife, out of jealousy, poisons it, but Euphemia succeeds in poisoning her with the remains of the poison that had killed her son. The wife’s family shut her up in a tomb, intending to kill her; Euphemia in her desperation prays to the Confessors — and miraculously finds herself the next morning by their shrine, safe and sound. When the Goth is sent back to Edessa, Sophia manages, with the help of bp. Eulogios (d. 387!), to get him arrested, and he is sentenced to death by the Military Governor, Addai (who is also attested in other sources). Whether or not the story has an actual historical basis, it no doubt reflects a not uncommon situation. It will have been put into writing (almost certainly in Syriac) by someone connected with the shrine of the Confessors, and probably around the mid 5th cent..</p>

<p>Greek Church Father, bp. of Caesarea (Palestine), and author of the first History of the Church and first universal Chronicle. His Ecclesiastical History is confined to the Roman Empire; at the end of Book I it contains the earliest reference to the letter of king Abgar of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> to Jesus and the sending to Edessa of Thaddaios (Addai in the later Syriac work, <ref type="cr">The Teaching of Addai</ref>). Many of Eusebius’s works were translated into Syriac and some survive complete only in Syriac.</p>
<p>1. ‘Ecclesiastical History’ (<i>CPG</i> 3495), preserved incomplete; ed. P. Bedjan (1897) and W. Wright and N. Mclean (1898); GT by E. Nestle (1901). The Armenian translation was made from Syriac, rather than Greek.</p>
<p>2. ‘Martyrs of Palestine’ (<i>CPG</i> 3490): the long recension is preserved solely in Syriac (ed. with ET, 
W. Cureton [1861]); in Greek only the short recension is found in Book X of the Ecclesiastical History.</p>
<p>3. ‘Theophania’ (<i>CPG</i> 3488), preserved complete only in Syriac, ed. S. Lee 1842, ET 1843; GT by H. Gressmann (1904; new ed., by A. Laminski, 1992), and study by Gressmann (1903). Extracts are given in Bedjan, <i>Mar Jacobi Sarugensis Homiliae Selectae</i>, vol. 1, 721–69.</p>
<p>4. ‘Chronicle’ (<i>CPG</i> 3494). The Greek original of this important work is lost, and the complete text is preserved only in Latin and Armenian translations. According to <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> this was translated by Shemʿon of <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref> (6th cent.?), but according to <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (who in fact continued Eusebius’s Chronicle in his own work). Only excerpts survive incorporated into Syriac chronicles (notable the<ref type="cr"> Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>, <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref>, and Michael Rabo); for these, see P. Keseling, ‘Die Chronik des E. in der syr. Überlie­ferung’, <i>OC</i> 3.1 (1927), 23–48, 223–41, and 3.2 (1927), 33–56; also R. W. Burgess, <i>Studies in Eusebian and post-Eusebian Chronography</i>, vol. 1 (1999), and W. Witakowski, ‘The Chronicle of Eusebius, its type and continuation in Syriac historiography’, <i>ARAM</i> 11/12 (1999/2000), 419–37.</p>
<p>5. ‘Onomasticon’ (<i>CPG</i> 3466), on biblical place names; fragments of the Syriac translation were ed. by 
I. E. Rahmani (and others) in <i>ROC</i> 23 (1922/3), 225–70, and have been republished (in transcription) by S. Timm (TU 152; 2005).</p>
<p>6. ‘Letter to Carpianus’ (<i>CPG</i> 3465), explaining the tables indicating concordances between the four Gospels. This ingenious system was originally devised by Ammonius, but was considerably refined in Syriac (where the tables are found in many early Gospel mss.). The Syriac text is edited by P. Pusey and G. H. Gwilliam in their edition of the Peshitta Gospels (1901), 1–21; with a study by Gwilliam in <i>Studia Biblica</i> 2 (1890), 241–72.</p>
<p>7. ‘Gospel Questions’ (<i>CPG</i> 3470), dealing with the exegesis of select passages; the available Syriac excerpts were ed. by G. Beyer, in <i>OC</i> 2.12–14 (1925), 30–70; 3.1 and 2 (1927), 80–97, 57–69.</p>
<p>8. ‘Apology for Origen’ (<i>CPG</i> 3476). An excerpt in Syriac translation is attributed to <ref type="cr">Gregory Thaumaturgus</ref>, ed. P. de Lagarde, <i>Analecta Syriaca</i> (1858), 64–5.</p>
<p>Two further works survive only in Syriac, but are not thought to be genuine:</p>
<p>9. ‘Encomium on the Martyrs’ (<i>CPG</i> 3493), preserved in a ms. dated 411; ed. B. H. Cooper, in <i>Journal of Sacred Literature</i> 5 (1868), 404–8.</p>
<p>10. ‘On the Star of the Magi’ (<i>CPG</i> 3507), ed. 
W. Wright, in <i>Journal of Sacred Literature</i> 4.9 (1866), 117–36; 4.10 (1867), 150–64.</p>
<p>According to ʿAbdishoʿ there was also a Syriac translation of Eusebius’s ‘Life of Constantine’, but this does not survive. In his ‘Preparatio Evangelica’ (not translated into Syriac) Eusebius quotes (VI.10.1–48) from a Greek translation of the ‘Book of the Laws of the Countries’, attributed to <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Eusebius of Emesa</head><ab type="infobox"/>(ca. 300 – before 359) 
<p>Bp. of the Syrian city of Emesa (<ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref>), author of homilies and biblical commentaries. A native of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> and contemporaneous with <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, Eusebius received a Greek education. He studied and worked in Caesarea (Palaestina), <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, and Alexandria, before becoming bp. of Emesa (shortly after 341). In the Greek tradition, Eusebius’s name somehow remained tainted with Arianism, which helps explain why his writings, all originally written in Greek, do not survive in direct transmission.</p>
<p>In addition to Eusebius’s homilies, a number of which exist in early Latin and Armenian translations, there is an Armenian translation of his commentaries on: Gen., Ex., Lev., Num., Deut., Josh., Judges, 1–4 Kings (i.e. 1–2 Sam. and 1–2 Kings). Only the Gen. commentary is quite developed; the other books are dealt with very succinctly. Excerpts of the original Greek text have been identified in the Greek Catena tradition and in an exegetical collection (‘Epitome’) by Procopius of Gaza (d. ca. 538). Some of Eusebius’s works existed in a Syriac translation. <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> quotes Eusebius for his opinion that Hebrew was the first language. 
A much more important witness is <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, who quoted numerous passages from Eusebius’s commentaries, without, however, ever mentioning his name.</p>
<p>A specific feature of Eusebius’s biblical interpretation consists in the many quotations from ‘the Syrian’ (<i>ho Suros</i>), i.e., the Syriac OT (along with the less numerous quotations from ‘the Hebrew’). Somewhat critical of the Greek Septuagint, Eusebius used the Syriac version to gain access to what he saw as the authentic meaning of the Hebrew original. These quotations from ‘the Syrian’ are an important witness to the early <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>.</p>
<p>As for Eusebius’s Christology, in addition to references in the sermons and — only rarely — in the commentaries, 33 passages explicitly attributed to him were included in the Florilegium that <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> added to his ‘Memre against Ḥabbib’ (ca. 482). Even though they were used by Philoxenos in support of his late–5th-cent. Miaphysite Christology and may not, therefore, give an unbalanced picture, there seems to be no reason to doubt their authenticity. As such, they provide further evidence of the existence of Syriac translations of Eusebius’s works.</p>

<p>His early life, of which hardly anything is known, was evidently as a monk, and then an archimandrite, in Constantinople where, by 448, he and his teaching evidently had an influential following. In Nov. 448 Eusebius bp. of Dorylaeum denounced his teaching to Patr. Flavian, and Eutyches was summoned to a synod which condemned him (<ref type="cr">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>, ‘Church History’, II.2; Acts of Council of Chalcedon, First Session). He appealed to Pope Leo I (<i>CPG</i> 5948) and to Dioscorus, presenting professions of faith in formulations that were considered acceptable (Leo’s reply also survives [<i>CPG</i> 5953]). He was restored at the second Council of Ephesus (449), but under the new emperor Marcian he was condemned again at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and this time exiled. Exactly what his teaching really was is unclear (both at the time and today), but he was understood to have held that Christ is consubstantial only with the Father, and not with us — a position rejected by both miaphysites and dyophysites.</p>

<p>Greek monastic author originating from Pontus. After a short career in Constantinople, where he was befriended by <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, he left for Palestine where he was converted to the ascetic life by Melania the ­Elder, and in 383 went on to Egypt where he spent the rest of his life as a monk. His extensive writings (<i>CPG</i> 2430–2482) were condemned in Greek at the Council of Constantinople (553), due to his speculative theories on cosmology and the Fall, developed from those of Origen. Though some of his monastic texts survived in Greek under different names and so his ascetic teaching remained influential, it is only in Syriac and Armenian translation that extensive writings are preserved under his own name. Only part of those in Syriac have yet been edited, the most important being the ‘Chapters on Knowledge’ (<i>Kephalaia Gnostika</i>), which survives in two forms, a widely read one in which the speculative elements had been modified, and (in a single ms.) an unexpurgated form. Several works are transmitted in two or even three translations, indicating their popularity.</p>
<p>Evagrius’s writings were very much appreciated and often quoted by Syriac monastic authors; <ref type="cr">Babai the Great</ref> wrote an extensive Commentary on the Chapters on Knowledge (in the adapted version; ed. Frankenberg). In the 8th cent. <ref type="cr">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref> had knowledge of both forms of the ‘Chapters on Knowledge’, but considered the unexpurgated version to be an adaptation by some heretical reader.

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Exegesis, Old Testament 
</LemmaTitle><p>The Bible and its interpretation have always played a major role in the world-view of Syriac-speaking Christians. A great number of texts are preserved in which the Bible is retold or explained. Biblical interpretation is found not only in commentaries, but also in many other genres.</p>
<label type="subsection">The Earliest Syriac Literature</label>
<p>The OT was translated into Syriac at a very early stage, probably even before the New Testament: though the Book of the Laws of Countries (see under <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>) quotes Gen. 9:6 in a form that stands closer to Targum Onqelos, the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> OT is already cited in <ref type="cr">Tatian</ref>’s <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref> (written in the 170s; Joosten). Neither these works, nor any of the other texts written before the 4th cent. that have come down to us, is dedicated to the exegesis of the OT, though such compositions as the <ref type="cr">Odes of Solomon</ref> and the Hymn of the Pearl (see <ref type="cr">Acts of Thomas</ref>) may certainly have been influenced by it, for instance in the way they describe Paradise.</p>
<label type="subsection">Fourth- and Early Fifth-Cent. Exegesis</label>
<p><ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>’s twenty-three Demonstrations (between 337 and 345) are treatises based to a large extent on biblical quotations. Aphrahaṭ discusses issues that must have been important to his community, which lived in the Persian Empire. In addition to subjects such as faith, love, fasting, prayer, wars, conversion, humility, and death, he also wrote on themes which suggest that his community had to defend its position vis-à-vis Jewish groups or rather Judaizing tendencies within Christianity. Thus he discusses, among others, circumcision, Pesach, Sabbath, food laws, virginity, and sanctity. Although he wrote against the Jews, especially in his historical interpretation he used Jewish traditions. His spiritual interpretation is mainly typological.</p>
<p><ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> (d. 373) wrote a Commentary on Genesis and an Explanation of Exodus (he may have written commentaries on other books of the OT as well, as the monk <ref type="cr">Severos</ref> and <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> claim, but this can no longer be ascertained). He retells the biblical narrative, while filling the gaps and trying to establish what happened and why. Method and content show a clear affinity with Jewish biblical interpretation; still, no Jewish sources known today are quoted. Although he himself would call most of his exegesis in these commentaries ‘factual’, he did aim at a refutation of Manichean and Marcionite interpretations. He seems less interested here in spiritual exegesis, though there are a number of passing references to Christ. By way of exception, he adds a spiritual interpretation to his factual (historical) exegesis of Gen. 49. In marked contrast to these commentaries, his <i>memre</i> (homilies, mostly in verse) and <i>madrāše</i> (often translated as ‘hymns’) show a wealth of symbols. In the Hymns on Paradise (11.6–7) he explains that in addition to the factual meaning one should try to find the ‘hidden power’ of the plain terms, or ‘pale colors’, which God uses in order to communicate with human beings. In these hymns the horizon is not the end of the OT period, but the eschaton. Still, the commentaries and the poetic works remain connected through a common basis, formed by Ephrem’s factual interpretation as well as his theological interests.</p>
<p>The particular genre of Ephrem’s commentaries (close to that of the ‘rewritten Bible’) was not commonly followed by later Syriac exegetes, but his poetry became a great source of inspiration. In the 5th and 6th cent., and even later, many <i>memre</i> and <i>madrāše</i> were written (see <ref type="cr">Poetry</ref>), of which some were attributed to Ephrem. Most of these <i>memre</i>are sermons in verse, but some are rather narrative poems in which a biblical story is retold. A special form of <i>madrāšā</i> is formed by the genre of the dialogue poem, in which two biblical characters speak in alternating verses. The oldest Syriac representatives of this ancient genre were indeed written by Ephrem himself, but many others are anonymous. In Greek numerous works survive under the name of Ephrem, but most of these are not authentic.</p>
<p>Not long after Ephrem, the anonymous author of the <ref type="cr">Book of Steps</ref> uses biblical interpretation to teach about a perfect, ascetic way of life. The author has a number of ideas in common with Aphrahaṭ and Ephrem, but in contrast to them he does not incorporate Jewish traditions in his work. The <ref type="cr">Cave of Treasures</ref> recounts biblical history from the Creation to Pentecost. Its use of apocryphal traditions (e.g. on Adam and Eve) has led some scholars to assume an early date for this composition, but in its present state it certainly does not antedate the 5th cent. (Leonhard 2004). Though the author clearly used Jewish traditions, his reconstruction of history omits parts which are important for Judaism, such as the time of Moses.</p>
<p>Commentaries on Qohelet and Job are attributed to <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>. The latter is, however, a text translated from Greek (Van Rompay 2006b). The Qohelet commentary, however, which was quoted by both East and West Syrians, could have well been written by Yoḥannan Iḥidaya in the first half of the 5th cent. He paraphrases the text and discusses its historical setting and purpose; at the same time, he does not shun allegorical interpretation.</p>
<label type="subsection">Parting of the Ways: From the Middle 
of the Fifth Cent. until the Advent of Islam</label>
<p>The <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref> played a pivotal role in the further development of the Syr. exegetical tradition. It was probably here that the works of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> (d. 428) were translated into Syriac. This Greek Antiochene theologian and exegete was one of the main sources of inspiration for the Dyophysites. Even during his lifetime his works were already studied in the School and his hermeneutic principles and terminology were taken over, together with his Christology and his view on history as a manifestation of God’s pedagogic interaction with humankind. A loyal follower of Theodore was <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref> (d. ca. 500), the author of many <i>memre</i> discussing OT passages. He was head of the School of Edessa until he had to flee to <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, probably around 471, where he became head of the newly founded <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>. Narsai knew Theodore’s works very well, and almost totally and exclusively adhered to his views. Theodore was considered the Interpreter <i>par excellence</i> by him as well as in the later E.-Syr. tradition.</p>
<p>The adoption of Theodore’s Christology and anthropology also met with resistance, however. The early miaphysite exegete and poet <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>(d. 521), for example, felt more at home with Ephrem’s views and those of moderate Alexandrians. Like Narsai, he mainly wrote <i>memre</i>, many of which interpret the OT. Yet Yaʿqub and Narsai had more in common. First of all, they shared a common Edessene tradition. In addition, it seems that the miaphysite opposition to Theodore did not necessarily lead to the acceptance of the radical allegorizing trend of some Alexandrians, who were ready to abandon the plain sense of Scripture altogether. Though Yaʿqub and other Miaphysites protested against certain parts of Theodore’s thought, through their connections with the School of Edessa they were influenced by his exegetical method and sought to achieve a balance between the Antiochene ‘historical’ approach and spiritual exegesis. Early translations of the Antiochene exegete <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref> were also widely read by Miaphysites and Dyophysites alike.</p>
<p>From the 6th- and 7th-cent. E.-Syr. tradition we know names such as <ref type="cr">Aḥob Qaṭraya</ref>, <ref type="cr">Nathniel of Sirzor</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Ḥenana of Adiabene</ref>, but we have no more than fragments of their exegesis. We do know that there was a crisis connected to the latter, who directed the School of Nisibis from 572 to 610. Much of the background to this crisis is no longer clear to us. His Christological views were condemned at a meeting of bps. in 612. His views may also have been more accommodating toward allegorical interpretations of the OT. However, as Reinink (2010) has indicated, the popular statement that Ḥenana rejected Theodore’s exegesis in favor of that of John Chrysostom is an oversimplification. The main problem seems to have been that Ḥenana showed some openness toward sources other than Theodore of Mopsuestia.</p>
<p>The mid-6th-cent. Commentary on the Psalms by <ref type="cr">Daniel of Ṣalaḥ</ref>gives us insight into the developing mia­physite tradition. Its interest in the historical setting and purpose of each Psalm reminds one of the Antiochene approach of Theodore of Mopsuestia. On the other hand, his exegesis often leads to an allegorical interpretation, which becomes quite prominent in his commentary. As the Psalms were read daily in the monasteries, it was important to control their interpretation. Daniel supplied the miaphysite leadership with a commentary in the form of 150 coherent, self-contained homilies, which were ideally suited to this purpose. They helped shape his community’s doctrine but also addressed larger political issues. It is here that we find the first serious attacks on the position of the emperor (Taylor 2010).</p>
<p>As an alternative to the dyophysite use of Theodore of Mopsuestia, the Miaphysites used a wider selection of Greek Fathers. Long and short versions of commentaries by authors such as <ref type="cr">Athanasius</ref>, <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nyssa</ref> have come down to us. It appears that the shorter ones constitute abbreviations of the longer ones, which date back to the 5th and 6th cent. <i>Terminus ad quem</i> for the abbreviated versions of the three authors just mentioned is the so-called London Collection (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,168), which was composed probably in the second quarter of the 7th  cent. The London Collection consists of extracts from various, primarily Greek, authors in Syriac ­translation, forming a commentary on most of the OT and NT. It is a work of encyclopedic scope. It would seem that the compiler is offering miaphysite readers a digest of Greek material in a form that is meant to replace earlier Syriac material. He often quotes Athanasius, Cyril, <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref>, <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, <ref type="cr">Basil the Great</ref>, Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom; Ephrem and <ref type="cr">John bar Aphtonia</ref><LemmaTitle> are the only Syriac authors mentioned. The compiler took as the basis for his commentary the Syriac translation of the Greek biblical text of his sources as well as the</LemmaTitle><ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref>.</p>
<label type="subsection">The Later E.-Syr. Exegetical Tradition</label>
<p>Even though Theodore of Mopsuestia was known as <i>the</i> Interpreter among the East Syrians, only fragments of the original 5th-cent. translations have come down to us. It seems that he was soon deemed too difficult to read. The simplification, explication, and defense of Theodore of Mopsuestia therefore formed a large part of the E.-Syr. exegetical efforts in the 8th and 9th cent. The witnesses to this process of simplification include some unedited question-and-answer collections attributed to Theodore himself, the Psalter commentaries of <ref type="cr">Denḥa</ref>-Grigor and of ms. Sachau 215, and the works to be discussed presently.</p>
<p><ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>’s Book of the Scholion (<i>Ktābā d-eskoliyon</i>), written ca. 792, explains problems in the form of questions and answers. It is in fact a systematic introduction to the entire E.-Syr. intellectual tradition. The author presents his work as an aid to understanding the commentaries of the Blessed Interpreter for those who have only just embarked on the study of his works. Theodoros bar Koni was indeed a very loyal follower of Theodore of Mopsuestia. One of his main sources must have been a collection of traditional material representing the common stock of E.-Syr. exegesis, in which problems in Theodore’s exegesis were dealt with, as well as objections against him.</p>
<p>Around the same time as Bar Koni, <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> wrote his Selected Questions on the entire Bible. This collection follows the biblical text without adding the kind of non-exegetical material that Bar Koni supplies. If these two authors used the same or a comparable collection of traditional exegesis at all, we must conclude that Ishoʿ bar Nun reworked this collection more thoroughly than Bar Koni did. The number of literal agreements between the two authors is very small. Another characteristic that sets Ishoʿ bar Nun apart from Bar Koni and Theodore of Mopsuestia is the use of the concept of <i>theoria</i> in a way that most Antiochenes would denounce as allegory.</p>
<p>Perhaps the closest we can get to the exegetical collection that may have been used at least by Bar Koni is the anonymous Commentary on Genesis–Exodus 9:32 of the ms. (olim) Diyarbakır 22. Like Ishoʿ bar Nun’s Selected Questions, this work does not have the encyclopedic character of the commentaries by Bar Koni and Ishoʿdad. It presents itself as an independent, original commentary, though it is clear that its core goes back to Theodore of Mopsuestia. As the Diyarbakır Commentary is not reworked in the form of questions and answers, we are often — but not always — closer to the original words of Theodore.</p>
<p>In its present form the Diyarbakır Commentary covers only a very small part of the Bible (Gen.–Ex. 9:32), but Van Rompay (1977) has been able to show that this work formed the core of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>’s commentaries on these parts of the Bible (9th-cent.). Ishoʿdad added other material to this and also used Ishoʿ bar Nun. Even though Ishoʿdad may occasionally have had access to the original Syriac translations of Theodore of Mopsuestia’s works, his knowledge of the Interpreter was often mediated by the Diyarbakır Commentary and other sources. A unique feature of Ishoʿdad’s work is its use of authors that did not commonly belong to the E.-Syr. tradition, among whom are even the Miaphysites Severus of Antioch and Cyril of Alexandria.</p>
<p>The Diyarbakır Commentary also formed the basis of the so-called Anonymous Commentary on the Pentateuch. In ms. (olim) Diyarbakır 22 we find a version of the latter work which includes the rest of the OT as well. For the sections where the Diyarbakır Commentary is extant, the Anonymous Commentary summarizes Diyarbakır while adding a limited amount of material from other sources, including Ishoʿdad. One source almost identical to the Diyarbakır Commentary and another close to Ishoʿdad and the Anonymous Commentary were employed in the OT sections of the <ref type="cr">Gannat Bussāme</ref> (‘Garden of Delights’), together with fragments of the exegetical <i>memre</i> of <ref type="cr">Aba II of Kashkar</ref>(d. 751). The <i>Gannat Bussāme</i> is probably a 10th-cent. commentary on the pericopes read in the liturgy, arranged according to the liturgical year.</p>
<p>Ishoʿdad was probably also the main source for the Paradise of Christianity by <ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043), a commentary on a large part of the Bible. This E.-Syr. author wrote in Arabic and became the intermediary of the Theodorian tradition not only to other Christian-Arabic authors, but also to <ref type="cr">Ethiopic Christianity</ref>. A different voice is heard in <ref type="cr">Eliya of al-Anbār</ref>’s Book of Instruction (<i>Ktābā d-durr</i><i>āšā</i>; 10th cent.), in which a number of OT passages receive allegorical interpretations. In contrast to him, his contemporary <ref type="cr">Emmanuel bar Shahhare</ref>’s Hexaemeron is inspired by Narsai, even in the form of the work, which consists of 28 <i>memre</i>.</p>
<p>The last two E.-Syr. works to be mentioned, <ref type="cr">Shlemon of Baṣra</ref>’s Book of the Bee (13th cent.) and <ref type="cr">Isḥaq Shbadnaya</ref>’s Poem on the Divine Economy (15th cent.), discuss the entire history of salvation in prose. These works contain much exegetical material, while the latter author also adds a prose commentary with quotations from the earlier exegetical tradition.</p>
<label type="subsection">The Later W.-Syr. Exegetical Tradition</label>
<p>As we have seen above, in the 7th cent. W.-Syr. exegesis was very much dominated by a number of Greek authors who were read in Syriac translation. The great polymath <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub</ref> of Edessa (d. 708) and his followers adopted many of their interpretations. He is not only the author of a revision of the Peshitta, but he also wrote a Commentary in short on the Octateuch (Kruisheer), a large number of Scholia, a Commentary on the Hexaemeron, and a number of letters of exegetical content. The works of Athanasius, Cyril, and Gregory of Nyssa were thus ‘Syriacized’ in three stages: after the full translation, an abbreviated version was produced; finally later Syriac authors such as Yaʿqub<ref type="cr"></ref>wrote their own commentaries using either the shorter or the full version, and appropriating interpretations often without indicating their sources. Though the 7th cent. was the heyday of the very precise and literal mirror translations, at the same time a movement began that aimed to make the main exegetical texts more accessible and especially more compact.</p>
<p>The OT part of the Commentary by the monk Severos (written in 861) likewise represents the movement just mentioned. Severos’s work consists, as he him­self states, of a commentary on difficult words of the OT, based mainly on Ephrem and Yaʿqub of Edessa, and a commentary on the NT, based mainly on John Chrysostom. There are a number of longer additions in this text, and in addition Shemʿun, the scribe of ms. Vat. Syr. 103, added a number of marginal comments. The biblical text quoted is that of the Peshitta, and for the OT, the number of explicit references to Greek exegetes (most of which were added by Shemʿun rather than Severos) is low. All in all, the work seems to be the opposite of the London Collection: this is the best of Syriac exegesis on the authentic Syriac Bible, with rather limited use of Greek sources. This fits very well with the atmosphere among the Syr. Orth. in the 8th and 9th cent., when Greek learning had become less popular and even suspect.</p>
<p>From the period of Severos, one should also mention the work of <ref type="cr">Mushe bar Kipho</ref> (d. 903), which also builds on predecessors, including Yaʿqub of Edessa. He must have written a commentary on most of the Bible, but on the OT mainly a Commentary on the Hexaemeron and a Commentary on Psalms have survived. Interestingly, he also quotes ‘Theodore the Nestorian’.</p>
<p>The 10th and 11th cent. show little activity in the field of W.-Syr. exegesis. It was not until the period of the <ref type="cr">Syriac Renaissance</ref> in the 12th and 13th cent. that ­<ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> and <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> compiled new exegetical collections. These works lean on earlier collections, but also show evidence of further ‘cultivation’ and ‘pruning’ of the tradition. A notable feature, for instance, is Bar ʿEbroyo’s openness toward the E.-Syr. tradition. After the 13th cent., hardly any new material was added to the W.-Syr. exegetical tradition.</p>
<label type="subsection">Conclusion</label>
<p>Syriac biblical interpretation shows a unique richness of metaphors and depth of spirituality. At the same time, its typological and symbolic interpretations are usually based on an explanation of the plain sense, answering the simple questions of what happened and why. Based on a long literary tradition Syriac-speaking Christians developed their own genres, both in prose and poetry. Yet from its very beginning Syriac exegesis has also shown openness to other traditions. Ephrem already knew about different versions of the biblical text, and the use of alternative readings would remain a feature of many later Syriac commentaries. He and his contemporaries also used Jewish exegetical traditions. In the 5th cent. Greek interpretations were taken over that may have appeared more precise and systematic than the earlier Syriac tradition, but they were actually quite similar in terms of their general approach to the biblical text. Greek sources became so popular that the exegetes of the 6th and 7th cent. even seem to have lost sight of the earlier Syriac tradition.</p>
<p>The balance was redressed, however, after the 7th  cent., paradoxically when Arab rule gradually began to weaken the position of the Syr. Churches. In this period, their members started editing anthologies and summaries of earlier exegetical literature. In the process of sifting, selecting, and summarizing, choices were made and new elements were added. Thus they built authoritative interpretative traditions that helped to give answers to questions posed by the political and religious circumstances of the period. Though the translation of Greek texts in the 5th cent. can be associated with the split between the Syr. Churches, later exegetes would also recognize the common ground formed by the teaching of Ephrem and the Cappadocians, by the Antiochene interpretation and method of John Chrysostom, and by philological comments, even if they originated with their doctrinal opponents. Some of the existing collections have assumed canonical status themselves, and are fostered and studied to the present day.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Syriac-speaking Christians, like Christians and Jews of every generation, have employed various exegetical strategies for interpreting their biblical canon. Their exegetical literature includes not only prose commentaries but also hymns, verse homilies, dialogue poems, treatises, commentaries on the lectionary cycle of biblical readings, and the Syriac versions of the NT. The astute biblical insights of early writers, such as <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> and <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, were extolled by subsequent authors who recycled their ideas in later prose commentaries. Since most Syriac authors were rarely explicit about their hermeneutical approach, their methods for interpreting the Bible are uncovered by studying their works.</p>
<label type="subsection">Early Syriac Literature</label>
<p>The history of the reception of the NT in the Syriac-speaking world begins with the Syriac translations of the Greek text of the Gospels. These translations introduced (or perhaps preserved) interpretations of the Gospels that are no longer found (or were never found) in the Greek text. For example, <ref type="cr">Tatian</ref>’s <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref> (2nd cent.) reports that John the Baptist (Mark 1:6) consumed milk and honey (not locusts and wild honey), which links his diet to the foods of the Promised Land (Deut. 6:3). The Old Syriac Gospels (<i>Ewangelion da-mparrš</i><i>e</i>), also known as the <i>Vetus Syra</i>, report that Barabbas was imprisoned for murder and <i>heresy</i>(Luke 23:25 [Curetonian]), a reading that may allude to the theological controversies at the time of this translation. Much of early Christian Syriac literature, though not explicitly exegetical, is in dialogue with the NT. The elusive <ref type="cr">Odes of Solomon</ref>(2nd cent.), a group of 42 liturgical poems (a few of which are also known in Greek and Coptic), show traces of early interpretations of the NT, such as the extended meditation on the virgin birth of Jesus in Ode 19. In the ‘<ref type="cr">Acts of Thomas</ref>’ (3rd cent.), the apostle Thomas sprinkles his farewell discourse with phrases from the NT allowing scholars to observe how these NT verses were interpreted in early Syriac Christianity. Particularly important for the author of the ‘Acts of Thomas’ were passages that promoted an encratic lifestyle such as Matt. 5:3 and 5 (ch. 94), 6:34 (ch. 28), and 11:29 (ch. 28 and 86).</p>
<label type="subsection">Aphrahaṭ and Ephrem</label>
<p><ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, who called himself a ‘student of Holy Scriptures’ (Dem. 22, §26), composed twenty-three ‘Demonstrations’ (337–45) that rely heavily on the Bible (he cites the NT approximately 700 times). Reading the Bible as an integral book, he illustrates its integrity through numerous ‘exemplary sequences’ (Murray 1977) in which characters from the NT find their precursors in the OT. He can focus on particular passages, as in the Fifth Demonstration (‘On Wars’), which is an exegesis of Dan. 2, 7, and 8. His exegesis is driven by a concern for practical questions of Christian life, such as prayer, fasting, humility, and the relations between Jews and Christians. For this reason, he exhorts his audience to put biblical precepts into practice: ‘My friends, it is not sufficient that we learn to read the books of God [i.e. the Bible], rather, we must do them!’ (Dem. 14, §32).</p>
<p>The first running Syriac commentary is Ephrem’s ‘Commentary on the Diatessaron’ (4th cent.), most of which survives in Syriac. He also wrote commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles and Paul’s letters (surviving in Armenian). Like most Syriac commentators, Ephrem does not remark on every verse, rather, employing a close reading of the text, he explains difficult verses and unravels conundrums. He distinguishes between the factual (or historical) and spiritual interpretations. The former focuses on the details in the biblical passage, the persons involved, and their historical circumstances, while the latter seeks to uncover the eternal truths within the text (Brock 2006). Aphrahaṭ (Dem. 5, §25 and Dem. 22, §26) and Ephrem (Comm. Diat.<i>,</i>ch 1,18–9) would agree that while the factual interpretation of the Bible is essential, the sacred text permits innumerable spiritual interpretations. Ephrem can use his exegesis to engage in polemics against his adversaries such as the Marcionites, the followers of <ref type="cr">Mani</ref>, and those he calls Arians in order to defend Nicene orthodoxy (Shepardson).</p>
<p>Like Aphrahaṭ, Ephrem interprets the Bible as an integral text: comparing and contrasting different scenes of the Bible, especially between the Old and New Testaments. Events in the OT prefigure (*<i>ṣwr</i> and *<i>rmz</i>) NT events and terms such as <i>rāzā</i> ‘symbol’ or ‘mystery’, and <i>ṭups</i><i>ā</i>‘type’ are used to penetrate the meaning of such events. These <i>rāze</i>, or ‘mysteries’, are not enigmas or inscrutable quandaries; the term <i>rāzā</i> is already found in Dan. 2:17–9 which reports that Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, along with its meaning, was a <i>rāzā</i>, the significance of which could only be revealed by God. The <i>rāze</i> drawn from nature prompt the believer to contemplate the divine. Thus, Ephrem teaches his audience how the natural characteristics of the olive tree illuminate the mystery of Christ (<i>rāz mšiḥā</i>; Comm. Diat.<i>,</i> ch. 21,11).</p>
<p>Also in the 4th cent. dramatic dialogue poems, many of which are anonymous (though they are sometimes ascribed to <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>), pictured imaginary exchanges between two biblical characters. One such poem extends the conversation between Mary and the angel Gabriel in order to draw out the theological implications of the annunciation and Mary’s role in the economy of salvation.</p>
<label type="subsection">Fifth and Sixth Century Exegesis</label>
<p>By the mid-5th cent., the works of the Antiochene exegete, <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> (d. 428), had been translated into Syriac. Theodore opposed the allegorical interpretation of the Alexandrian school in favor of a literal sense that takes into account the historicity of the passage and places less emphasis on the Christological interpretation of the OT (his ‘Commentary on the Gospel of John’ survives in Syriac). When emperor Zeno closed the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref> for its adherence to Theodore’s theo­logy (489), the school was reestablished at <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, just inside the Persian border, under the direction of Narsai (d. ca. 500). The establishment of this school would lead to distinct E.- and W.-Syr. exegetical traditions. Narsai wrote over three hundred verse homilies (<i>memre</i>) in many of which he recast particular biblical passages, including several Gospel parables, with dramatic style. His exegesis has much in common with Theodore’s: events in the OT must be seen in their context before they are considered as types for NT events.</p>
<p>Yaʿqub of Serugh (d. 521), though schooled in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> in the dyophysite Christology with Narsai, resisted Antiochene exegesis and the Chalcedonian formula. Like Narsai, he composed verse homilies (<i>memre</i>) in metered couplets of 7 + 7 or 12 + 12 on biblical topics. He engaged the Bible with a close reading in which he explored the meaning of a single verse or word in relationship to other passages from the entire biblical canon (similar to Ephrem). Thus, when David selects rocks to sling at Goliath (1 Sam. 17:40), Yaʿqub sees the rock as Christ, a reference to 1 Cor. 10:4 in which Paul alludes to Ex. 17:6 and Num. 20:7–13 (David and Goliath; <i>Memr</i><i>ā</i> 34). This complex interrelationship among four biblical verses illustrates how, for Yaʿqub, the Bible, an integral text, is best interpreted through an intertextual, typological approach.</p>
<label type="subsection">The E.-Syr. Exegetical Tradition</label>
<p>Adhering to the E.-Syr. tradition of Theodore of Mopsuestia and Narsai, <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Koni</ref> (8th cent.), a teacher at the school in Kashkar, wrote the ‘Book of the Scholion’ (792) which comprises 11 <i>memre</i>, four of which treat the NT. This work consists of questions and answers (a format well-known in E.-Syr. exegesis; Griffith 1982, 59) on individual or collections of biblical books. The NT chapters discuss the Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, and difficult passages in Paul’s Letters. His hermeneutical approach is explicitly typological: words and events in the OT are types and allegories for Christ’s salvific role in the NT. His exegesis seeks to defend the doctrines that were of interest to Theodore of Mopsuestia and the E.-Syr. exegetical tradition, though he also quotes <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref> and Origen.</p>
<p>In the mid-9th cent., <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> wrote commentaries on most of the NT, integrating the works of previous authors including Ephrem, <ref type="cr">Basil of Caesarea</ref> and the Cappadocians, John Chrysostom, and several unknown sources. He adhered to the exegetical approach of Theodore of Mopsuestia. The <ref type="cr">Gannat Bussāme</ref> is an anonymous, lengthy commentary that compiles E.-Syr. exegetical traditions according to the cycle of biblical texts in the liturgical year. Its date is disputed; it may be as early as the 10th cent. It includes texts from Ephrem, <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, and especially Ishoʿdad of Merv. The writings of several E.-Syr. exegetes are only known through quotations in the <i>Gannat Bussāme</i>. This repository of exegetical traditions influenced successive generations of Syriac authors.</p>
<label type="subsection">The W.-Syr. Exegetical Tradition</label>
<p>The W.-Syr. tradition steered closer to the exegetical approach of Alexandrian exegetes, the Cappadocians, and John Chrysostom. A contemporary of Yaʿqub of Serugh, <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> (d. 523) wrote Gospel commentaries (surviving in fragments). Because he viewed the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> as unsatisfactory for theological argumentation, he initiated a new translation of the Greek NT into Syriac (known as the Philoxenian version of which only fragments survive) that included the Minor Catholic Epistles and Revelation. His commentaries, in which he focuses on the plain sense and context of a passage, are closer to polemical homilies than to a verse-by-verse exegesis (McCullough, 19–21). Much of the works of <ref type="cr">Mushe bar Kipho</ref> (d. 903), who commented on the entire Bible, have been lost, though his commentaries on John, Luke and Acts along with part of the commentary on Matthew survive. He stands at the crossroads of W.-Syr. exegesis: as a compiler who brought together earlier exegetical traditions and as one who would influence later Syriac authors. <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> (d. 1171), who knew Mushe bar Kipho’s works, wrote commentaries on the entire NT. His aim was to summarize the exegetical insights of previous authors, though his main source may have been Ishoʿdad of Merv (McCullough, 83). Finally, in 1277 the polymath <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (d. 1286) completed his ‘Storehouse of Mysteries’, a collection of exegetical remarks on the entire Bible that reaches back into Syriac exegetical tradition to quote Ephrem, Yaʿqub of Serugh, Philoxenos, and even the E.-Syr. writer Ishoʿdad of Merv, though he was largely dependent on Dionysios bar Ṣalibi.</p>
<label type="subsection">Conclusion</label>
<p>The Bible has held a central place in Syriac literature as this brief history of the reception of the NT demonstrates. Early Syriac writers such as Aphrahaṭ, Ephrem, and Yaʿqub of Serugh knew the Bible well, having committed much of it to memory, and their writings witness to a close reading of it. They focused on the factual or historical sense of a passage and then perceived the <i>rāze</i> ‘mysteries’ within it that could give rise to spiritual interpretations. Syriac exegesis came under the increasing influence of the Greek Fathers. A century and a half after Ephrem, Philoxenos of Mabbug insisted on a new translation of the NT that was closer to the Greek. A century after that <ref type="cr">Tumo of Harqel</ref> revised the Philoxenian version (AD 616) mirroring the Greek text in Syriac at the expense of good Syriac idiom. But even as more Greek authors were translated into Syriac, later Syriac writers continued to revere the works of their cultural ancestors, such as Ephrem and Yaʿqub of Serugh, reprising their exegetical insights for successive generations including our own.</p>

[Syr. Orth.] 
<p>He was born in Diyarbakır (<ref type="cr">Amid</ref>) to Eliās Jacob Palak and Saydeh Safar and was given the baptismal name Naʿʿūm (he gave himself the nickname Fā<cTypeface:Italic>ʾiq). He studied in the local schools, and then taught from 1888 to 1912 at various community schools, mostly in Diyarbakır, but also for short periods in al-Bsheriyyeh, <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, Adıyaman, and <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref>. He witnessed the horrific massacres of 1895 in Diyarbakır. Fā<cTypeface:Italic>ʾiq was ordained a deacon in 1889 by Ignatius Peṭros III/IV. In 1908, after the Young Turk Revolution, he established in Diyarbakır the Jamʿiyyat al-Intibāh (known in Syriac as ʿIrutho), and shortly thereafter the newspaper <i>Kawkab Madenḥo</i> (1910–12, 43 issues), published in Syriac, Garshuni Arabic, and mostly Gar­shuni Turkish. He immigrated to the USA in 1912 where he lived in NJ. There, he established the newspaper <i>Beth Nahrin</i> (1916–21), and later became the editor of <i>Ḥuyodo</i> (Union) for one year (1921–22, 39 issues), an organ of the Assyro-Chaldean Association, after which he reissued <i>Beth Nahrin</i> (1922–30). He contributed to other periodicals such as <i>Intibāh</i> (NY, ed. Gabriel Boyaji), <i>Murshid Athurion</i> (Kharput, ed. Ashur Yusuf), and <i>Shiphuro</i> (Diyarbakır, ed. Basshār Ḥilmī). According to his biographer, he wrote many books in Arabic and Turkish which remain unpublished, but it is not clear how many are in final form and how many are mere notes.</p>
<p>His Syriac writings include:</p>
<p>1. A collection of national anthems in Syriac (but also in Turkish, and Arabic) (Diyarbakır, 1908; 2nd ed. NJ, 1913).</p>
<p>2. A Syriac reader titled <i>Ktobo d-qeryono d-suryoyuto</i> (NJ), designated as part 1 but probably no other parts were published.</p>
<p>3. A brief question-answer pedagogical work on mathematics (incomplete ms.).</p>
<p>4. A pedagogical work on geography based on Salīm Sāmī Juqqī’s Arabic textbook <i>al-Khawāṭir al-wāfiya fī uṣūl al-jughrafya</i> (incomplete ms.).</p>
<p>5. The sayings of Benjamin Franklin translated from Arabic into Syriac (ms.).</p>

<Author>G. A. Kiraz</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Fars
</LemmaTitle><p>A region in southwestern Iran, often identified as the heartland of the Iranian people. Known as Anshan in Elamite texts, the region received the name Fars in the mid 7th cent. BC, following the migration of Persian-speaking tribes from the northern Zagros Mountains (de Planhol 328). Under the Sasanian Empire (224–642), the region reclaimed its role — established under the Achaemenids — as the epicenter for Persian royal ritual and building. Early Sasanian rulers honored the ‘holy places’ of their ancestors with new cliff reliefs and multilingual inscriptions and established ambitious urban foundations, such as Bishapur and Firuzabad, in the broad highland basins of the region’s interior (Wiesehöfer 336).</p>
<p>Christianity arrived in Fars via at least two major channels between the 3rd and 4th cent. Deportees from Roman Syria, forcibly resettled in the region by Shapur I (r. 240–72) and his grandson Shapur II (r. 309–79), included Christians who maintained their faith even after some of them intermarried with the local ‘Persian’ population. E.-Syr. martyr literature, chronicles, and archaeology preserve scattered echoes of these deportees’ background in Roman Syria (Jullien and Jullien 153–87). Commercial contacts with northern Mesopotamia provided the other major conduit for the introduction of Christian doctrines into Fars. The <ref type="cr">Acts of Mar Mari 
</ref>(a 7th-cent. apostolic narrative) claim, for instance, that merchants from Fars and Khuzistan traveled to the ‘West’, where they were converted by ‘the blessed apostle Addai’, presumably at <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, before returning home. The region’s earliest churches were thus diverse in both their origins and ethnicity. According to a plausible report in the 11th-cent. Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref> (ed. Scher, I.I [PO 4], 222, ch. 2), the liturgy in 3rd-cent. Fars was conducted in both Greek and Syriac.</p>
<p>During the 5th–6th cent., the Christian community of Fars emerged as one of the most important eparchies of the Ch. of E. The region’s metropolitan bp., based in the coastal city of Rev Ardashir, signed as the sixth highest ranking bp. at the synod of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>in 424 (Fiey 178–9). Other regional cities, such as Darabgard, Ardashir Khurrah (possibly to be identified with medieval Siraf), and even Istakhr (where the Sasanian dynasty was founded), had also attained episcopal status by this time (idem 202–3). The bishops’ names, more often Persian than Syriac, hint at the growing influence of ethnic Persians, whose conversion sparked a wave of translations, beginning in the 6th cent., from Syriac into Middle Persian. The demand for these translations was heightened by the links between Fars and the Persian-speaking population of adjoining regions, especially the dioceses scattered around the periphery of the Persian Gulf. According to a well-known passage in the Chronicle of Siirt (ed. Scher, II.I [PO 7], 117, ch.  9), Maʿna, metropolitan bp. of Fars in the mid-6th cent., produced Persian ‘hymns, homilies, and responses to be sung in church’, and distributed them to ‘the maritime lands (<ref type="cr">Beth Qaṭraye</ref>) and India’. It appears that the metropolitans of Fars even appointed clergy for the most far-flung merchant communities of the Indian Ocean. The 6th-cent. pepper merchant of Alexandria, Cosmas Indicopleustes, was amazed to find clergy appointed ‘from Persia’ (<i>dia Persidos</i>) on the island of Socotra near modern Somalia and at Kalliana on the south-western coast of India (‘Christian Topography’ 3.65; Weerakkody 237 and 244).</p>
<p>In the late Sasanian and early Islamic period, the metropolitan bishops of Fars entered into a prolonged and bitter conflict with the E.-Syr. patriarchs. The patriarchal correspondence of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> documents the growth of this rivalry that culminated in the synod in 676, which raised the provinces of Beth Qaṭraye and India to metropolitan status, thus removing them from the authority of bishops of Fars. Despite this truncation of its jurisdiction, Fars remained the base for a vigorous Persian Christian culture deep into the Islamic period. Christian law books produced in Fars in the 8th and 9th  cent. reveal not only the depth of Christians’ adoption of Sasanian-derived marriage patterns, but also the determined efforts of the clergy to purge their flock of these ‘Magian’ habits (Payne 191–241). Synodical lists continue to name bishops for the region into the 12th  cent. —
and indeed as late as 1318 at the port city of Siraf.</p>
<p>In contrast to the range and depth of these textual references, the archaeology of Fars has not yet yielded any clear physical evidence for the region’s Christian communities. This lacuna probably reflects the biases of modern research conditions more than a lack of archaeological potential, since parallel fieldwork in the Persian Gulf has identified the remains of churches at at least eight sites, including a large 9th-cent. monastery 
(123 x 88 m) on the island of Kharg, only 50 km northwest of ancient Rev Ardashir (Carter 97–8; Steve 85–154).</p>

[Syr. Orth., then Syr. Cath.]
<p>Elias Fatḥallāh was a Syr. Orth. priest from <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>. Following his conversion to Catholicism in 1770, he moved to the Vatican, where he worked as an interpreter for Pope Pius VI and published a second edition of the Syriac Breviary in 1787, based on the first 1696 edition of Athanasius Safar of <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, to which he added the Sunday office. From 1793 to 1798, he held the chair of Syriac and Chaldaic at the Collegio de Propaganda Fide. Recruited there in 1798, he became Napoleon’s interpreter and a member of the Commission des Sciences et des Arts as the director of the Oriental section of the press during the Egyptian Campaign. He is referred to as ‘Don Elias Fatalla’ in Napoleon’s correspondence dated 16 Oct. 1798. He is also once mentioned as the interpreter of General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, the father of the famed author of <i>The Three Musketeers</i>. Western biographers of Bonaparte are not aware of his Syriac heritage, nor do Eastern biographers know of the Napoleonic episode. Among the former, he is sometimes confused with Elias Pharaon, a younger Melk. interpreter from <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>, called back to France at Napoleon’s request in 1802. Among the latter, Tarrazi confuses him with Elias Amīrkhān, another Syr. Cath. priest from Amid and the chorepiscopos of the Mar Behnam Syr. Church in Cairo, an erroneous account frequently repeated thereafter. Further inaccuracies, such as the report attributing his conversion to the exhortations of Michael Jarweh, the bp. of <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> and future Syr. Cath. Patr., may be explained by the desire of early Syr. Cath. historio­graphy to embellish the storyline of this patriarch, who reestablished in 1782 the Uniate patriarchal line started in 1662 and interrupted since 1702. As a matter of fact, Fatḥallāh became Catholic four years before Jarweh, and no reference is made to the Patr. in the introduction to his breviary. Two Armenian-Turkish letters exposing the grievance of the Armenian widow Hripsime and addressed to the Doge of Venice, signed and sealed in attestation of content by, among others, his brothers Khawājas Isḥāq Niʿmatallāh and Maqd. Bishāra Fatḥī and the Chald. Patr. Yawsep IV in Amid in 1782, are now preserved in the private collection of the Fathi family (Aleppo). That his family was then leading the Catholic party in Amid may be inferred from a Garshuni epistle addressed by the Amid community to Patr. Jarweh in Mardin on 25 Feb. 1782, regarding the adoption of the Catholic mass, in which the names of his father, Khawāja Fatḥallāh son of the deacon Amīrchāh, also known as Fatḥī, and his two aforementioned brothers appear first among some seventy four civilian signatories. This letter, today at the <ref type="cr">Sharfeh</ref> Monastery, was also signed by eleven Syr. priests, reflecting the early inroad made by the Syr. Cath. movement in Amid, supported by the local presence of the Chald. patriarchate and Capuchin monks. Catholicism had much less success here, however, than in Aleppo or <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, as resistance to it was fierce, since the city was the frequent residential abode of Syr. Orth. patriarchs. In 1810, Khawāja Mikhāyil Fatḥī Zadeh obtained a <i>firman</i> establishing the Catholic bp. Behnam as Patr. at <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿ<ref type="cr">farān</ref>, in a last attempt to catholicize the entire Syr. church. This attempt was later aborted by the Orthodox party, and the split of the Syrians into two churches has persisted to the present day.</p>

<p>French historian of the Syriac Churches. Born at Armentières in northern France, he studied for the priesthood at the Dominican Seminary at Le Saulchoir, outside Paris. After his ordination in 1938 he was sent to Iraq where he spent over three decades (1939–73) at the Dominican House in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>. It was as a result of living in Iraq that his interest in the history and topography of the Syriac communities of the region was aroused. Ironically it was soon after his being granted Iraqi citizenship that he was expelled from the country (1974). He moved to Beirut, and then spent a short period living in Cairo, but returned to Beirut, despite the outbreak of the civil war, in order to be closer to the Syriac tradition which he so much loved; he remained in Beirut for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>His first major publication (1959) was a historical guide to the ancient churches of Mosul, but it was his three-volume <i>Assyrie chrétienne</i> which established him as the leading authority on the topographical history of the Syriac communities of Iraq. In his next book, <i>Jalons</i> (1970) he set out to supplement J. Labourt’s classic <i>Le christianisme dans l’empire perse sous la dynastie sassanide (224–632)</i>, of 1904, in those areas where more recent publications had shed new light. His doctoral thesis (Dijon, 1972), on the dioceses of the Maphrianate (covering from its inception in 629 to 1860), was published in <i>Parole de l’Orient</i> 5 (1974) and 8 (1977–8). Having dealt in <i>Jalons</i> with the pre-Islamic centuries he then turned to a monograph (1975) on the Mongol period, and only two books later did he go back in time to cover the Abbasid period (1980), concentrating on the patriarchal line. The intervening monograph <i>Nisibe</i> (1977) returned to topographical history, this time of a particular diocese. While producing these books he was also publishing a large number of important articles, usually on historical topography, and a small (but very useful) selection of these was reprinted in <i>Communautés syriaques</i> (1979). The title of his repertory of E.- and 
W.-Syr. dioceses (1993) deliberately reflects the three-volume <i>Oriens christianus</i> by his fellow Dominican predecessor, Michel le Quien, which was published posthumously in 1740; this represents the fruits of Fiey’s work over some three decades, and serves as an invaluable work of reference, as well as the fundamental starting point for all future, more detailed, studies. His <i>Saints syriaques</i>, which was left unfinished at his death, serves as another repertory; this covers only those saints who are specific to the Syriac Churches. He also contributed many articles to the <i>Dictionnaire d’histoire et de géo­graphie ecclésiastiques</i> and to the <i>Enciclopedia dei Santi: le Chiese orientali</i> (1998–9). Fiey was one of the first scholars to use the term ‘syriaque’ as an ethnic term, as found in the title of his brief history, told for children (1996). The Festschrift that was being prepared for him eventually appeared as a memorial volume; this also contains Fiey’s own account of his life, ironically entitled ‘A quiet little life’.</p>

<p>Italian Syriac scholar, Professor of Semitic philology and Assyriology at the universities of Florence (1930–1940) and Rome (1940–56). Trained in law, philosophy, and Semitic languages at the university of Graz, in his youth he hand-copied a large number of unedited Syriac texts in the major European libraries, particularly in the British Museum. A versatile and extremely productive scholar, he was the founder of academic Assyriology in Italy, and to this discipline he devoted the best of his energies after 1927, but he never ceased publishing and studying the Syriac materials that he had collected before the First World War. His main areas of expertise, cultivated in over 80 articles and book reviews since 1914, included: the Syriac tradition of Aristotelian logic (particularly the translation and commentary to the Organon by <ref type="cr">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref> [1922–43]); the Greek background of philosophical and theological writings by authors such as <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>, <ref type="cr">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref>, <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, <ab type="infobox"/>Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes, <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>, <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref>, <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (to whose psychology he devoted a series of essays [1931–3]); the edition of several Syriac astrological and divinatory texts. The most important results of his research on Syriac philosophy are summarized in his essays ‘Meine Arbeiten über die Philosophie bei den Syrern’, <i>Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie</i> 37 (1925), 2–15, and ‘I miei lavori dal 1928 al 1940 sulla filosofia greca presso i Siri’, <i>Rivista di Filologia e d’Istruzione Classica</i> 19 (1941), 121–149. His last essay on a Syriac topic concerned the famous illuminated ms. of the <ref type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref> in the Medicean-Laurentian Library in Florence (1959). During the last phase of his scholarly activity (1948–57), he also devoted several studies to selected topics of Mandaean religion and literature, as well as to Mandaic lexicography.</p>

</head><ab type="infobox"/>Monastery of Qarṭmin
<p>The Monastery of Qarṭmin began long before its official foundation date of 397. The founders were Shmuel (Samuel) of Eshtin and his disciple Shemʿun (Simeon) of Qarṭmin. In the village of Qarṭmin (Yayvantepe) there is a church of the martyred bp. Karpos, Shmuel’s spiritual father. Karpos was killed, according to the Life of ­Shmuel, by Persian raiders on the southern escarpment of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, which rises from the Plain of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>. The most likely context is 350, when Nisibis, then a Roman city, was besieged. Shmuel fled north from the raiders, into the hills, and so came to the village of Qarṭmin, where he acquired a disciple, Shemʿun. Together they lived in a ruined temple now called ‘The Arches of Mor Gabriel’. Then the boy Shemʿun had a dream in which he was commanded by an angel to build a Beth Ṣlutho (open-air enclosure for prayer) further to the west. Perhaps Shemʿun was still alive when, more than forty years later, the Roman Emperor established the institution officially by his benefaction in 397.</p>
<p>The answer to the question of how the Emperor in Constantinople came to hear of this remote monastery and to consider it worthy of his attention must be connected with the Roman frontier-garrison in the Castle of Tur ʿAbdin built after the Persian raid of 350. The Christian soldiers in the castle honoured the holy men of Qarṭmin and attributed the security of the frontier partly to their prayers. It may well be that the Emperor also believed in the efficacy of the holy men’s prayers and that the first large benefactions to Qarṭmin (gold to build buildings, valuable communion vessels, and vestments for the liturgy) were intended not only to raise morale, but also to propitiate the God of Victories. The gesture of Honorius and Arcadius was repeated even more generously by the following administration, that of Theodosius II.</p>
<p>Theodosius’s death nearly coincided with the Council of Chalcedon (451), for which the new Emperor, Marcian, was personally responsible. Considering the later reputation of Qarṭmin as a focus of opposition to Chalcedon, it seems likely that, by disagreeing with that council, the monks forfeited a benefaction from this emperor. For the rest of the century confusion reigned. Some emperors, like Zeno and Anastasius, tried to compromise on the apparently insoluble issue of Chalcedon. But in 512, Anastasius, changing his policy, sided with the opponents of the Council. In the same year, according to the record preserved at Qarṭmin, he caused a church with a splendid prayer hall to be built there. This is still in use as the main church of the monastery. It seems likely that he also built the so-called ‘Dome of Theodora’, an octagon of identical height and building materials, and that this was originally used as a baptistery. Later, when there were no longer large numbers of adult converts to Christianity who came to the monastery to be baptized after making a penitential pilgrimage, the dome was used as a kitchen. The great slab in the main church was made in the 8th cent. for the purpose of making bread dough; for many centuries it stood under the dome.</p>
<p>After Anastasius, no emperor declared himself an opponent of Chalcedon, and no emperor made a benefaction to Qarṭmin. There is a story that the Empress<ref type="cr"> Theodora</ref>, consort of Justinian I, who was undoubtedly a great friend of monks and especially of those opposed to the Council of Chalcedon, visited Qarṭmin and gave it the dome which is named after her. This report is unworthy of credence.</p>
<p>The monastery became the residence of a bp. when the Persian Conquest created vacancies on four sees in the area; the abbot of Qarṭmin was asked to fill them all until suitable men could be found for those outside Ṭur ʿAbdin. By the time of the Arab Conquest, in 639/40, the abbot of Qarṭmin, now Gabriel of Beth Qustan (Bequsyone), was managing two dioceses from his monastery: that of Ṭur ʿAbdin and that of Dara. No doubt the success with which he negotiated a treaty with the Arab conquerors, protecting the rights of the Christians in his region, made him great in the eyes of later generations. When his Life came to be written, little was remembered about him, which shows that it took time for him to acquire the reputation of a saint. He had certainly acquired it by the year 774, in which the plague raged in Ṭur ʿAbdin, killing 94 monks at Qarṭmin and all the prominent people at <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Ṣalīb</ref>. After 30 Qarṭmin monks had died in a single night, the corpse of Gabriel was exhumed and fixed upright in the church to pray for an end to the plague. After this, the right arm was detached and taken to Ḥaḥ, near Dayr al-Ṣalīb, to bring an end to the plague there also.</p>
<p>The loss of 94 monks did not bring to an end the prosperity of Qarṭmin, which was now sometimes called Dayro d-ʿUmro (Arabic <i>Dayr al-ʿUmr</i>), though it did perhaps make people begin to call it ‘The Monastery of Gabriel’. The miracle performed by Mor Gabriel may also have created a need for a written history of the monastery including the Lives of Shmuel and Shemʿun and a Life of Gabriel (‘The Qarṭmin Trilogy’).</p>
<p>Mor Shemʿun d-Zayte, ‘Simeon of the Olive-Trees’ (d. 734), a monk of Qarṭmin, became bp. of <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref> and used his influence to build in and around Nisibis, whose Christian community (existing alongside Zoroastrians) was largely Ch. of E., profit-making installations, such as olive-presses, water-mills, bath-houses, and inns, which would add to the income of the Monastery of Qarṭmin. Qarṭmin remained buoyant into the late 8th cent.; but after about 800 a decline set in. The 9th cent. seems to have been a period of low ebb. ‘Mor Gabriel’s Monastery’ settled down into a cosy relationship with the neighbouring villages, particularly Beth Sbirino (Bsorino) to the east. It was a man from that village, bp. Yuḥanon, who revived, in the 11th cent. (after it had been extinct for a cent.), the ancient Edessene script for use in making new parchment copies of the Gospels. He called it <i>sre</i><i>ṭ ewangeliyon</i> ‘Gospel script’ (one of the possible etymologies of the name esṭrangelo). One ms. written out and illustrated by his nephews, Emmanuel and Niho, monks of Qarṭmin, is extant in Berlin. <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> speaks of a total of seventy such volumes by these calligraphists in the library of Qarṭmin. This ‘renaissance’ was ultimately the consequence of the Byzantine reconquest of <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref> in 934.</p>
<p>The Monastery of Mor Gabriel is today the residence of the bp. of Ṭur ʿAbdin and gives the appearance of great prosperity, though the villages all around are becoming depopulated.</p>

<p>Physician. Gabriel was a member of the Bokhtishoʿ (Arabic Bakhtishūʿ) family, which produced a number of famous physicians first in Gondeshapur (<ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>) and then in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>(see D. Sourdel, in <i>EI</i><sup>2</sup>, vol. 1, 1298; L. Richter-Bernburg, in <i>EIr</i>, vol. 4 [1990], 333–6). Gabriel himself was the personal physician of Caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd and later also of al-Amīn and al-Maʾmūn. He is said to have composed (in Arabic) a number of works in the field of medicine, little of which survives (a list is provided in F. Sezgin, <i>Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums</i>[1967–2007], vol. 3, 226–7). For his research, Gabriel commissioned Arabic translations of Greek authors, especially <ref type="cr">Galen</ref>, from <ref type="cr">Iyob of Edessa</ref> (d. ca. 835?) and <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873) (see G. Bergsträsser, <i>Ḥ</i><i>unain Ibn Is</i><i>ḥā</i><i>q.</i><i><cCase:All Caps>ü</i><cCase:><i>ber die syrischen und arabischen Galen-Übersetzungen</i> [1925], <i>passim</i> [see the index on p. 44]).</p>
<p>Gabriel appears several times in the letters of Cath. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref><LemmaTitle></LemmaTitle>(d. 823). Letter 47, for instance, mentions Gabriel’s involvement with Timotheos in procuring copies of the <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref> (ed. O. Braun, ‘Ein Brief des Katholikos Timotheos I über biblische Studien des 9. Jahrhunderts’, <i>OC</i> 1 [1901], 299–313; ET in S. P. Brock, <i>A brief outline of Syriac literature</i>[2nd ed. 2009], 240–5), while Letter 21 refers to Gabriel’s intercession with the Caliph on behalf of Timotheos (O. Braun, <i>Timothei patriarchae I epistolae</i>[CSCO 74–5; 1914–15], 133.12–5 [Syr.], 89.22–4 [LT]). Notwithstanding the seemingly amicable relationship between these two men, it is reported that Timotheos condemned Gabriel for his philandering, but that Gabriel eventually repented (see H. Gismondi, <i>Maris Amri et Slibae.</i><i>De patriarchis nestorianorum commentaria</i> [1896–99], vol. 1, 74 [<i>Maris textus arabicus</i>], vol. 1, 65 [<i>Maris versio latina</i>]).</p>
<p>Gabriel is cited a number of times in the Lexicon of <ref type="cr">Ḥasan bar Bahlul</ref> (see R. Duval, <i>Lexicon Syriacum auctore Hassano bar Bahlule</i> [3 vols.; 1888–1901, repr. 1970], xvi-xvii). He is also mentioned in the ‘Catalogue’ of <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> (Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 3, 257–8) where he is grouped together with Ḥasan bar Bahlul,<ref type="cr"> Ishoʿ bar ʿAli</ref>, and a certain ‘Maruzaya’ (probably either <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ of Merv</ref>or Zekarya of Merv, assuming that they are two distinct individuals). This passage is, however, ambiguous as to whether Gabriel was the author of a Lexicon (so Assemani and Baumstark) or was only one of the principal sources of the Lexicon of Bar Bahlul (so Duval).</p>

<p>Metropolitan of Baṣra; author of a collection of juridical texts. Next to nothing is known about Gabriel’s life, except that he was metropolitan in 884 and in 893. In the last quarter of the 9th cent., he compiled a collection of civil and ecclesiastical laws in two parts, for which he primarily drew on materials from existing law books of E.-Syr. authors: <ref type="cr">Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ishoʿbokht</ref>, <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref>, <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</ref>, and from the so-called Syro-Roman Law Book, the 73 pseudo-Nicene canons attributed to <ref type="cr">Marutha of Maypherqaṭ</ref>, and the canons of the E.-Syr. synods (<ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>). Gabriel did not reproduce these sources literally, but abbreviated and reworked them. The first part of the collection deals with matrimonial law, hereditary law, and other secular matters; the second part contains ecclesiastical rules concerning church hierarchy, hospitals, poorhouses, schools, and monasteries. While the entire collection is structured in the form of questions and answers as a technical device allowing the incorporation of long quotations, it is only in the substantial section devoted to liturgical issues that real questions are asked and answers provided (Second part, B, 1–70). A particularly interesting and, as far as Syriac is concerned, unique text provides a blueprint for the regulations for an association of artisans (First part, 48). Only fragments of Gabriel’s collection have been preserved, but the work can largely be reconstructed with the help of the Syriac Nomocanon of <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (d. 1318) and of the second part of the Arabic collection <i>Fiqh al-Naṣrāniyya</i> by <ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (1st half of 11th cent.), two works that are largely dependent on Gabriel’s collection.</p>

<p>Metropolitan bp. of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> and poet. Gabriel is famous for a long <ref type="cr">ʿonitha</ref>, which according to the title he wrote when he was a monk in the Monastery of Beth Qoqa. It has Sabrishoʿ (late 6th – early 7th cent.), the founder of this monastery, as its main subject, but the author speaks about him only after having given a long overview of salvation history. This begins with creation and extends to the birth of Christ and the life of apostles and saints (including several Egyptian saints). Partly in twelve- and partly in eight-syllable rhymed verses, the poem has a convoluted style and abounds in Greek words. While it has failed to charm modern scholars (Baumstark: ‘eine monströse ʿOnithā’; Fiey: ‘désespérément vague et très prolixe’), the number of mss. that preserve it is an indication of its popularity. A few other, much shorter poems are preserved as well. Assemani assumes Gabriel’s authorship for an introductory piece that precedes the ‘Revelation of Paul’ in ms. Vat. Syr. 180 (which also contains the long <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>onitha</i>) without, however, providing evidence. In his capacity as Metropolitan bp. of Mosul Gabriel took part in the election of Cath. <ref type="cr">Yahbalaha III</ref> in 1281. No further details about his life (nor about his name, which means ‘locust’) are known. Gabriel’s work has remained unpublished, except for a specimen in Cardahi’s <i>Liber thesauri</i>.</p>

<p>Author of an important Commentary on the Liturgy. Several Gabriels from <ref type="cr">Beth Qaṭraye</ref> are known from the 6th/7th cent., but this Gabriel (described as bar Lipeh) is probably not to be equated with any of the others. A  date of writing prior to the liturgical reforms of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> is certain, since he mentions that <ref type="cr">Shubḥalmaran</ref>, metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Karka d-Beth Slokh</ref> was still alive. The Commentary is divided into 5 <i>memre</i>, each with a ­series of questions and answers. These cover: 1. <i>ramšā</i> on weekdays (15 questions); 2. <i>ṣaprā</i> on weekdays (17 questions); 3. <i>ramšā</i> and <i>lelyā</i> on Sundays (5 questions); 
4. <i>ṣaprā</i> on Sundays (9 questions); 5. Eucharistic Mysteries (8 questions, the second of which is a commentary on the Eucharistic rite). This important work is preserved in a single ms. (Brit. Libr. Or. 3336) of the 13th cent. (though the ms. has a date, its reading is uncertain); so far only the commentary on the Eucharist has been published and translated. An abbreviated form of at least much of the work is attributed to <ref type="cr">Abraham bar Lipeh</ref> (ed. 
R. H.  Connolly, in CSCO 71, 76; 1911, 1915). The relationship between Gabriel and Abraham is not clear.</p>

and beginning of the 13th cent.) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>The <i>Gannat Bussāme</i> ‘Garden of Delights’ is an extensive commentary on the E.-Syr. lectionary. Tradition ascribes the work to an otherwise unknown ‘Interpreter of the Turks’. The date and place of the composition are uncertain. Although some modern scholars hold to the 13th cent. as the date of its composition, there may be some arguments for the assumption that the <i>Gannat Bussāme</i> was composed in the 10th cent. in the city of <ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>(Gondeshapur). The text tradition shows two lines of transmission: one going back to a lost ‘Vorlage’ of the old ms. (olim) Urmi 180, the other to a lost ms. from the monastery of Abraham (the Upper Monastery in<ref type="cr"> Mosul</ref>). The latter represents a revision of the lectionary allowing the work’s adaptation to the practice of the Upper Monastery in Mosul. The original lectionary of the <i>Gannat Buss</i><i>āme</i>, however, shows correspondences both with the monastic usage and with the practice in <ab type="infobox"/>the Cathedral Church of Kokhe in <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, but it also has lessons found in neither. It is, therefore, likely that the <i>Gannat Bussāme</i> was originally based on a lectionary system that reflected a specific ­local usage. The <i>Gannat Bussāme</i> is a very important source for the E.-Syr. exegetical tradition, since its commentary, apart from its use of the commentaries of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, is based on sources and the works of authors that are lost or inaccessible today. In particular two authors should be mentioned here. Firstly, the exegetical prose homilies written by <ref type="cr">Aba II of Kashkar</ref> (7th–8th cent.), of which many fragments and extracts have been preserved in the <i>Gannat Buss</i><i>āme</i>, containing the exegesis of passages from Gen., Num., Isa., and the four Gospels. Secondly, the commentaries of Ṣliba Zkha <ref type="cr">Ṣharbokht bar Msargis</ref>, an author who is not known in the Syriac tradition outside of the <i>Gannat Bussāme</i>. It is, however, very likely that we may identify Ṣharbokht with Ṣahārbukht b. Māsarjīs, known from the Arabic-Islamic tradition as a medical author from Beth Lapaṭ, who lived in the 9th cent. The excerpts from Ṣharbokht in the <i>Gannat Bussāme</i> concern the exegesis of pericopes from the four Gospels, Acts, and Rom. It appears from these excerpts that Ṣharbokht’s commentaries are typical representatives of exegetical compilation works (comparable, for example, with the genre of Ishoʿdad of Merv’s commentaries on the OT and NT). Unique is the way in which Ṣharbokht incorporates theoretical medical knowledge in his exegesis. It is possible that he as a teacher was connected with both the Theological School and the Medical School in Beth Lapaṭ.</p>

<Author>G. J. Reinink</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Garshuni</head><ab type="infobox"/>Karshuni<LemmaTitle>
</LemmaTitle><p>The term Garshuni refers to Arabic texts written in 
<ref type="cr">Syriac script</ref>. The etymology is unknown: it has been connected with Gershon (Ex 2.22) and therefore to the legend of Moses as the inventor of writing, or to a certain Carsciun. In Levantine Arabic, <i>btaḥkī karšūnī</i>? ‘do you speak Garshuni?’ indicates an exotic, incomprehensible language. The variant Karshuni probably derives from the rendering of a Syriac /g/ in Arabic script. The use of the term has been extended to label other cases of heterography: Armenian, Kurdish, Malayalam, Persian, or Turkish ‘Garshuni’ (E.-Syr. script).</p>
<p>Most Garshuni texts are written in Serṭo. Especially Maron. scribes, belonging to a profoundly arabized community, wrote various kinds of Garshuni texts, on various mediums. The earliest dated sample known so far is a historical note written in 1154 in the margins of the <ref type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref>, f. 7b. The earliest complete literary texts copied in Garshuni are of the 14th cent. The system was used by E. Syrians too, from the 17th cent. Recording the Arabic language in Syriac script answers ideological rather than practical purposes. The emergence of Garshuni may be explained by the symbolic significance of the traditional alphabet as a device to assert and strengthen cultural identity and the magic and aesthetic virtues attributed to it.</p>
<p>Garshuni requires a high degree of literacy in Arabic. Classical Arabic diacritics and spelling conventions are commonly used. The correspondence between Syriac graphemes and Arabic phonemes is not always one-to-one, e.g., the Syriac letter <i>g</i> is used for both Arabic <i>gh</i>and <i>j</i>.</p>

<LemmaTitle>Georgian Christianity, Syriac contacts with
</LemmaTitle><p>The modern state of Georgia covers two distinct regions in antiquity, Lazika to the west, and Iberia (Kartli) to the east, with its capital at Mtskheta. Archaeological evidence indicates that there were Christians living in Mtskheta by the 3rd cent., but not until the first half of the 4th cent. did Christianity have a significant presence in Iberia. According to tradition the Christianization of Iberia was due to the influence of St. Nino, a captive slave woman who converted King Mirian III in the 330s (related, but without any names, also in <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, Chronicle VII.3). By the 5th cent. Christianity was the dominant faith in Iberia. The most primitive Georgian literary strata display the influence of Syriac roots, mediated largely through <ref type="cr">Armenian</ref> channels. Prior to the 7th cent. the Georgian Church was miaphysite. The geographical proximity and doctrinal affinities with miaphysite Syriac and Armenian communities ensured that those Churches would have a great impact on early Georgian literature, theology, religious practices, and ecclesiastical politics. In the early 7th cent. the Georgian Church broke with the Armenian Church and became Chalcedonian, thereby aligning itself with Byzantium. From that time Greek influence became more prominent in Georgian literary culture and religious practices. The spread of monasticism in Georgia is largely traced back to the arrival in the 6th<sup></sup>cent. of the ‘Thirteen Syrian Fathers’, one of whom, Iovane (John), is said to have been from ‘the the borders of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> in the land of Mesopotamia’. None of them can be identified with otherwise known figures, though one (Abibos) does have a Syriac name, but with a Greek ending; it seems likely that they were miaphysite. The biographies connected with these Syrian saints underwent development over the course of time (Martin-Hisard), and now an older recension has recently turned up among the ‘New Finds’ of Georgian mss. at <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref>, Sinai (Aleksidze).</p>
<p>There are a number of disparate connections between Syriac and Georgian Christianity, some direct, others indirect.</p>
<p>1. The indirect influence (via Armenian) of early Syriac versions and/or the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref> on some early mss. of the Georgian Gospels and Acts has been claimed by some scholars, but this is a topic where great caution needs to be exercised before firm conclusions can be drawn, especially regarding the proposed influence of the Diatessaron (Birdsall).</p>
<p>2. The prince <ref type="cr">Peter the Iberian</ref>, who had been a political hostage in Constantinople, eventually became a prominent miaphysite monk in Palestine in the late 5th cent. and was known to <ref type="cr">Severus</ref>. Of the two Greek biographies of him, one (perhaps by <ref type="cr">John Rufus</ref>) survives in Syriac translation, while the other, by <ref type="cr">Zacharias Rhetor</ref>, is lost apart from a minute Syriac fragment. The relationship of these to the Georgian Life, where Peter has become Chalcedonian, is not entirely clear. The theory that Peter is the author behind the writings of <ref type="cr">Pseodo-Dionysius the Areopagite</ref> has only found limited acceptance.</p>
<p>3. Georgian and Syriac speakers came into contact with one another in several different localities:</p>
<p>A. From the 10th–13th cent. the Black Mountain, to the northwest of Antioch, was home to monasteries of many different Churches, including both Syriac (Melkite) and Georgian; a number of extant 11th-cent. mss. were written there (see Djobadze, 108–11 for Georgian, and Brock 1990 for Syriac). Although it was there that several Georgian translations of Syriac writers were made, these were not direct from Syriac, but by way of Greek.</p>
<p>B. <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> and the monasteries of the Judaean desert. The Georgian presence in Jerusalem goes back to the 5th cent., and early Georgian liturgical mss., along with some Armenian and <ref type="cr">Christian Palestinian Aramaic</ref> mss., constitute an important witness to the early form of the Jerusalem liturgy. In the Middle Ages the Monastery of the Holy Cross (now Greek) was in Georgian hands. The presence of both Syriac and Georgian monks at various monasteries, notably Mar Saba, is attested especially for the 9th–10th cent.</p>
<p>C. Sinai. From at least the 9th–13th cent. Syriac- and Georgian-speaking monks must have lived side by side on Sinai, and many mss. in these languages were copied there (table of early dated mss. in Brock 2003, 112–3; this can now be supplemented from the ‘New Finds’). Especially in the late 10th cent. there were close connections between Mar Saba Monastery and St. Catherine’s Monastery. The Georgian monk Iovane Zosime (active between 949 and 987; Tarchnishvili, 109–14) moved from Mar Saba to St. Catherine’s some time before 973. For some of his manuscripts this famous scribe re-used older Christian Palestinian Aramaic manu­scripts; one of these is the ‘Codex Zosimi Rescriptus’ of 979, now in the Schøyen Collection (formerly Sinai, Georgian ms. 81); the undertext, containing a variety of different works, has been reconstructed in Desreumaux 1997. Other mss. copied by Iovane with Christian Palestinian Aramaic undertexts are Sinai New Finds, Georgian mss. 19 (dated 980) and 20 (dated 986), the latter being part of ms. 93+92 of the Old Collection (now divided between Princeton, Birmingham, and Göttingen). It was probably in the 10th cent. that some quire numbers in Georgian were added to Sinai Syr. 30 (see <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Version</ref>).</p>
<p>4. Georgian translations of Syriac authors may be either made from Syriac, or through the intermediary of Greek, Armenian, or Arabic. Translations by way of Armenian or directly from Syriac will be the earliest; amongst those that have been published are: <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, ‘Discourse’ 6 (under the name of <ref type="cr">Hippolytus</ref>; ed. with LT, G. Garitte, in <i>LM</i>77 [1964], 301–66), the <ref type="cr">Life of Ephrem</ref> and the Life of <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref> (ed. with LT G. Garitte, in CSCO 171–2, 1957); the <ref type="cr">Cave of Treasures</ref> (ed. with FT, J.-P. Mahé, in CSCO 526–7, 1992–3), and <ref type="cr">Sahdona</ref>, ‘Book of Perfection’, II, 7–12 (ed. with LT, 
G. Garitte, in <i>LM</i>69 [1956], 243–312). The homily on the Nativity attributed to <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> which features in a late 10th-cent. early Homiliary (Van Esbroeck, 193–94) appears not to correspond with any of his published works. Translations were made by way of Greek of a number of works attributed to <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> (few if any are genuine Ephrem apart from the ‘Repentance of Nineveh’, ed. with LT, Garitte, in <i>LM</i>80 [1967], 75–119) and of Discourses from the First Part of the works by <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>. These were the work of the prolific translator Euthymius of the Holy Mountain (d. 1028; Tarchnishvili, 126–54), according to his Life (ET by 
T. Grdzelidze, <i>Georgian Monks on Mount Athos</i>[2009], 69–70), though a few texts under Ephrem’s name already feature in a Homiliary dated 925 (Garitte, <i>Catalogue,</i> no. 36). Further works from the Greek Ephrem corpus were translated by another famous translator, Epʿrem Mtsire (‘the Less’), working on the Black Mountain in the late 11th cent. (Tarchnishvili, 182–98, esp.189). A few hagio­graphical texts are said to have been translated directly from Syriac, such as that on the martyrs Aqebshma, Yausep, and Aitalaha (Tarchnishvili, 467); the Life of Porphyry of Gaza came into Georgian by way of a lost Syriac translation from the Greek (Childers). In the case of others, such as the Life of Abraham and his niece Mary, the precise source, Greek, Syriac, or Arabic, remains to be determined. It is noticeable that most of the Syriac saints commemorated in the 10th-cent. Calendar of Palestinian provenance (ed. Garitte, <i>Le calendrier palestino-géorgien</i>, 1958) are martyrs of the Persian Empire.</p>
<p>5. Some more general influences in the form of theological phraseology (Winkler) and of historical ideology (Rapp, 125–9) have also been discerned.</p>

<p>Metropolitan bp. of <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref> and Cath. (from 660 or 658 until his death). Gewargis hailed from <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>and was a monk in <ref type="cr">Beth ʿAbe</ref>. He came into contact with the future Cath. <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref>, whose successor he became first as bp. of Adiabene and later as cath. In 676 Gewargis convened an important synod on the island of Dirin, in <ref type="cr">Beth Qaṭraye</ref>, the region that, under his predecessor, had seen major troubles and division (which perhaps still resonated in the background of this synod). The report and canons of the synod are preserved in the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. The canons deal with: the significance of preaching, in particular on feast days (no. 1); church discipline, the proper place of monks, and a better division between the tasks of clergy and laity (nos. 2–8, with no. 6 focusing on the role of the church in jurisdiction); strict rules for the <i>bnāt qyāmā</i> (no. 9), clergy and bps. (nos. 10–11), monks (no. 12), liturgy (no. 15), and funerals (no. 18); abuses and lax behavior with regard to marriage (nos. 13, 14, and 16; with warnings against unions between Christian women and ‘pagans’ [<i>ḥanpe</i>], a term which may perhaps include Muslims, as well as against polygamy); a ban on drinking wine with Jews in Jewish taverns, especially after the Christian liturgy (no. 17); and the respect due to bps. (no. 19).</p>
<p>Attached to the canons is a letter (dated a few years later), written by Cath. Gewargis to a certain Mina, priest and chorbishop in Persia, which sets out the theology and Christology of the Ch. of E. The author defends the authority of <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref> and <ref type="cr">Theodore</ref> (of Mopsuestia) against those who challenge it, and includes a short patristic florilegium (featuring passages attributed to <ref type="cr">Ignatius of Antioch</ref>, <ref type="cr">Athanasius</ref>, Ambrose, <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, Amphilochius of Iconium, <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref>, and even <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, who occasionally was ‘compelled’ to write the truth), showing that the Ch. of E. preserved orthodox Christianity as it developed in the Roman Empire, unsullied by heretical teachings.</p>
<p>Cath. Gewargis is also said to have commissioned <ref type="cr">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>, a fellow monk from the Monastery of Beth ʿAbe, to compile the ‘Paradise of the Fathers’, which became an authoritative collection of ascetic texts.</p>

<p>Unknown author of an important Commentary on the Liturgical rites. An extensive liturgical commentary in seven sections is preserved in a number of mss.; in his <i>Bibliotheca Orientalis</i> Assemani attributed the work to <ref type="cr">Gewargis of Arbela</ref> (9th cent.?), but without any good evidence; as a result the author is normally now referred to as ‘Pseudo-Gewargis of Arbela’ (another wrong attribution is to <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</ref>). The chapters in each section provide answers to particular questions. The seven sections cover the following topics: 1. the liturgical year (24 questions); 2. <i>ramšā</i> (21 questions); 3. <i>lely</i><i>ā</i> and <i>ṣaprā</i> (9 questions); 4. the Eucharistic Mysteries (30 questions); 5. Baptism (9 questions); 6. Consecration of a church (8  questions); and 7. Burial, and Marriage (7 questions; the section on Marriage seems to be a secondary addition, though perhaps by the same author). Connolly’s edition also includes the short ‘Commentary on the (liturgical) Services’ by <ref type="cr">Abraham bar Lipeh</ref> of <ref type="cr">Beth Qaṭraye</ref> (II, 161–80); in many places this is simply an abbreviation of <ref type="cr">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref>’s Commentary.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Gewargis Warda</head><ab type="infobox"/>(13th cent.?) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>The <i>Kthābhā d-wardā</i>‘Book of the Rose’ is a collection of hymns for the various festivals of the liturgical year, usually attributed in the mss. to a certain Gewargis, surnamed Warda. Most of the hymns belong to the <ref type="cr"><cTypeface:Italic>ʿOnithā</ref>genre and parts or the whole of the corpus have been incorporated, especially in the 19th cent., in larger collections of <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>onyāthā</i> by other hymnographers. So far, only 31 of the ca. 150 items have been published or translated. The ms. transmission presents a high degree of variation in the number and order of the texts. No systematic study of the text history of the <i>Kthābhā d-wardā</i> or of the hymns attributed to Gewargis is available, and it is therefore difficult to define criteria of authenticity. The two poems ‘On the capture of Jerusalem by Saladin’, preserved in only one ms., probably do not belong to the original nucleus.</p>
<p>There is no reliable information on the life or birthplace of the alleged author (and/or compiler?). One poem is an outcry against an infidel deacon of a village near <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>, and in one ms. (Sachau 64) it is said that Gewargis was from Arbela, perhaps because he has been confused with the 10th-cent. E-Syr. author <ref type="cr">Gewargis of Arbela</ref>, or in order to distinguish him from a Gewargis of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, mentioned in the same ms. Like <ref type="cr">Khamis bar Qardaḥe</ref> (also connected with Arbela), Gewargis is not included in the ‘Paradise of Eden’ by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>. Attempts to place Gewargis in the first half of the 13th cent. at the time of the events described in poems of the <i>Wardā</i> collection (famines and the Mongol raids of 1223/4–1235/6) are in contradiction with, e.g. the mention of Timotheos II (Patr. from 1318 to 1332) in the ‘ʿOnithā on the Catholicoi of the East’.</p>
<p>The <i>Wardā</i> contains exhortations to repentance, hymns for the various feasts, commemorations of saints, martyrs, and calamitous historical events. The melody and the liturgical occasion for which the text is fitted are noted above each poem. The use of biblical texts and exempla is often rich and felicitous. Some texts elaborate on apocryphal material, e.g. ‘In praise of Mary’ lists the traditional names of the twelve kings (as in <ref type="cr">Shlemon of Baṣra</ref>) and ‘On the Childhood of Christ’ possibly derives from a lost E.-Syr. source, parts of which are preserved in the ‘History of the Blessed Virgin Mary’ (ed. E. A. W.  Budge, 1899). A ‘<i>memrā</i>on Man as Microcosm’ appears to derive from Greek medical and philosophical traditions via the Syr. <i>Traité d’Ahoudemmeh sur l’homme</i> (ed. F. Nau, PO 3.1, 1905). The hymns on historical events have recently been read as examples of theological reflection on history. More properly, they should be interpreted as liturgical texts, as their function was stated to be. Referring to specific historical events or, more in general, to disasters which were dramatically recurrent, they probably functioned as textual supports for public commemorations, as prayers of supplication, or to avert disaster.</p>

<p>Bp. and learned author. Shortly before his death Patr. <ref type="cr">Athanasios II</ref>asked bp. Sargis Zakunoyo to ordain Giwargi bishop of the Arab tribes, which he did in Nov. 686. As a protegé of Athanasios II and a friend of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, he belonged to a line of learned scholars associated with the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref>. On Yaʿqub’s death in 708 Giwargi completed the final book 7 of his commentary on the Six Days of Creation. Several of his works concern Greek philosophy, and he revised earlier translations of <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>’s ‘Categories’, ‘On Interpetation’, and ‘Prior Analytics’ (ed. G. Furlani); this is preserved in the 8th/9th-cent. ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,659, together with introductions and glosses. A number of verse texts are attributed to him: on the Patr. <ref type="cr">Severus</ref>, the monastic life, the Myron (sometimes attributed to <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serug</ref>), Palm Sunday, the Forty Martyrs, and the Burial of Bishops (the last two remain unpublished). His 11 letters cover a wide range of topics, including philosophy, astronomy, theology, and literary criticism; he also wrote a short commentary on baptism and eucharist.</p>

<p>Patr. (1687–1708) whose patriarchate was contested by five anti-patriarchs during various parts of his life. Born in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> to ʿAbd al-Karīm, his family produced three patr. (him, his nephew <ref type="cr">Isḥoq</ref> [1709–24], and Giwargis IV [1768–81], an uncle’s grandson), two maph. (Matay II [1713–27], a nephew, and Loʿozor IV [1730–59], a nephew’s son), one bp. (a nephew’s son), and five priests (an uncle, a cousin, a brother, and two nephews).</p>
<p>Giwargis joined <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>, was ordained priest in 1669, and consecrated bp. for Jazīrat Qardu in 1677. When Maph. Yaldo voluntarily abdicated the maphrianate to serve in Malankara, Giwargis was installed maph. in his place in 1684. On 22 Apr. 1687, he was elevated to the patriarchate.</p>
<p>Following disputes with the newly established Syr. Cath. community in <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>, Giwargis spent one year in the Aleppo courts and regained control over churches which were under the control of the Cath. party. He rebuilt <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> in 1699, and renewed many churches in <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> (1704), <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, <ref type="cr">Amid</ref> (1690s), Jazīrat Qardu, and Mosul. He built two new churches in Ḥisn Manṣūr (ca. 1701) and Zakho. Giwargis visited Edessa in ca. 1702 or 1703 where he was sent to prison due to conflicts with the Cath. party there. He died in 1708 and was buried in Dayr al-Zaʿfarān.</p>
<p>Many divisions took place during his lifetime. In 1701, there existed six patriarchs (Giwargis in Mardin, Ḥabib in <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, Peṭros who later converted to Catholicism, Denḥa, Behnam, and Shemʿun of Maʿdan), and three maphrians (Isḥoq Loʿozor, Isḥoq b. Gbir who later converted to Catholicism, and Loʿozor of Ṭur ʿAbdin).</p>

<p>Syr. Orth. Patr. (758–89). Giwargis was born in Bʿeltan, near <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref> (Emesa), perhaps in a Melk. family (according to a non-Syriac source [see Evetts, 413]), but apparently at a young age he turned Syr. Orth. He was educated in Syriac and Greek learning in the <ref type="cr"><cCase:All Caps>m<cCase:>onastery of Qenneshre</ref>.</p>
<p>After the death of Patr. Athanasios IV Sandaloyo, at the electoral synod at Mabbug in December 758, though still only a deacon, he was chosen Patr. Mesopotamian bishops opposed his elevation and somewhat later chose Yuḥanon of the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Qarqaphto</ref>, bp. of Kallinikos/Raqqaʿ, as an anti-patriarch. The schism could have ended in 762, when Yuḥanon of Kallinikos died, but at the synod at Serugh in 764/5 the Mesopotamian bishops accepted Dawid bp. of Dara as the successor to the deceased anti-patriarch.</p>
<p>Dawid accused Giwargis of tax irregularities, and Caliph Abū Jaʿfar ʿAbdullāh al-Manṣūr (754–75) put him in prison for nine years (767–75). After this Caliph’s death his son and successor, al-Mahdī, upon his accession in 775 released Giwargis, on the condition that he was not to exercise his office or title. Eventually, in 777, he was confirmed in his office by the Muslim 
authorities.</p>
<p>On 22 May 785 he presided over the synod in Kfar-Nabu in the region of Serugh at which 22 canons, mostly of a disciplinary nature, were passed.</p>
<p>During one of his pastoral journeys, in the region of Qlaudia, he fell sick and not long thereafter he died in the year 789/790 in <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref> near <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>, where he was also buried.</p>
<p>During his imprisonment he is reported to have written numerous discourses and metrical homilies (<i>memre</i>), not preserved, as well as an exegetical work, the ‘Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew’, which displays his knowledge of <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref>, the Cappadocian fathers, and <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> (ms. Vat. Syr. 154, not published). He wrote also synodal letters and a letter to a deacon Guria of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (quoted by <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, Chronicle, vol. 3, 5–8) on the formula ‘We break the heavenly bread’, the use of which later became the subject of a long controversy.</p>

<p>This short apocalyptic work, known only in Syriac, probably dates from the early 8th cent. (probably before ʿAbd al-Malik’s death in 705), and is not preserved quite complete. It misleadingly claims to have been translated from Hebrew into Greek and thence into Syriac. A narrative introduction outlines the life of Christ, from the Annunciation to the Ascension; after the Ascension the Apostles gather in the Upper Room and pray for a revelation ‘concerning the End’. Simon Peter, James, and John ‘the Little’, brother of James, then each describes the revelation he has received. Simon Peter’s revelation is anti-dyophysite in character, James’s is concerned with the destruction and rebuilding of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>, while John’s is more strictly apocalyptic in character, describing the succession of kingdoms, a ‘king from the north’, the coming of a ‘wind from the south’ (i.e. Arab rule), and a succession of 12 kings; after a ‘week and a half’ the angel of wrath will descend, and ‘the Lord will return the south wind to its place’.</p>

<p>French Syriac scholar, director of <i>Patrologia ­Orientalis</i> (1941–92). Born in Mayet (Sarthe), in the West of France on 1 Jan. 1905, he studied in Le Mans in a school of the Jesuit Fathers and entered the Society of Jesus. In 1931, his uncle, Mgr. <ref type="cr">René Graffin</ref>, the founder and first director of <i>Patrologia Orientalis</i>, chose him to be his successor and secured the help of Pope Pius XI to obtain permission from the General of Jesuits that he should be allowed to prepare himself for this task. Graffin then studied all the Eastern Christian languages, but Syriac was to be his main field of interest. He taught Syriac at the Institut Catholique in Paris from 1951 to 1975 and was the professor of a whole generation of Syriac scholars, from France and abroad. In 1941, at the death of his uncle, he became director of the <i>Patrologia Orientalis,</i>a task that he pursued for fifty years until 1992, when René Lavenant, at the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome, was entrusted with the directorship. Graffin himself was able to complete two major multi-volume editions initiated by M. Brière: <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref>’s ‘Cathedral Homilies’, to which, after Brière’s death (1960), Graffin contributed the edition and translation of homilies 1–57 (PO 35.3; 36.1, 3, and 4; 37.1; and 38.2; between 1969 and 1977, all under the names of Brière and Graffin); and <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbog</ref>’s ‘Dissertationes decem de Uno e sancta Trinitate incorporato et passo’ (also known as ‘Memre against Habbib’), to which he contributed the edition and translation of Memre 3–10 (PO 38.3; 39.4; 40.2; between 1977 and 1980, all under the names of Brière and Graffin) as well as an additional volume with accompanying texts and an important Florilegium (PO 41.1; 1982, under the names of Brière and Graffin). He published one of the ‘Bases’ of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s ‘Lamp of the Sanctuary’, dealing with theology (PO 27.4; 1957); a series of anonymous homilies of the 6th cent. (PO 41.4; 1984); and <ref type="cr">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref>’s ‘Letter on the three degrees of monastic life’ (PO 45.2; 1992, co-authored with P. Harb). He also contributed regularly with editions, translations, and studies to <i>L’Orient syrien</i>and later to <i>Parole de l’Orient</i>, as well as to several Festschrifts. He himself was the recipient of a Festschrift in 1978 and of an honorary doctorate from <cCase:All Caps>Seeri<cCase:>, in India, in 1997. He died in Paris on 4 Dec. 2002.</p>

<p>French Syriac scholar and founder of <i>Patrologia Syriaca</i>, <i>Patrologia Orientalis</i>, and <i>Revue de l’Orient Chrétien</i>. He studied Syriac in Rome with J. Bollig, and in Innsbruck with G. Bickell, after which he was appointed (1886) to teach Syriac at the Institut Catholique in Paris, in succession to J. P. P. Martin. When he became aware of the wealth of Syriac mss. in both Paris and London, he conceived the idea of founding the series <i>Patrologia Syriaca</i> (I–III, 1894–1926), followed by <i>Patrologia Orientalis</i> (1903– ). In 1909 he resigned his chair at the Institut Catholique to concentrate on his editorial work for the <i>Patrologia Orientalis</i> and the periodical <i>Revue de l’Orient Chrétien</i> (1896–1946). The practical aspects of this work also included the designing of Oriental typefaces and the invention of a special device for photographing mss.

M. Brière, in <i>JA</i> 1933, 149–80; this includes his formidable bibliography); unlike Nau, however, Graffin himself only published a small number of Syriac texts. After Graffin’s death the editorship of the <i>Patrologia Orientalis</i> passed to his nephew, <ref type="cr">François Graffin</ref> (1905–2002), on whom see <i>Hugoye</i> 10.1 (2007), and more recently (1996) to the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Over the course of some 500 years, from the late 4th to the late 9th cent. an enormous number of Greek texts were translated into Syriac. These translations fall into three main categories: biblical texts in Greek; patristic texts (by far the largest surviving category); secular texts (medicine, philosophy, uplifting literature). With the exception of an 8th-cent. translation of Homer’s ‘Iliad’ (surviving only in some short excerpts), no Classical Greek poetry was ever translated, an indication that the motivation for undertaking translations was essentially utilitarian in character. Syriac scholars played a significant role in the ‘translation movement’ of the late 8th and 9th  centuries under Abbasid patronage, which provided the Arabic-speaking world with the Greek intellectual heritage of Late Antiquity; their contribution was especially important during the earlier years of this movement, seeing that there was a long tradition of translation from Greek into Syriac, but none yet from Greek into Arabic; for this reason many translators (including the most famous of them all, <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref>) first translated from Greek into Syriac, and then from Syriac into Arabic.</p>
<p>In quite a number of cases, the Greek original of a work has been lost, and only the Syriac translation survives. This applies above all to patristic authors whose works were subsequently suppressed in the Greek Church, such as those of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, <ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref>. But even with prestigious Greek authors, Syriac may preserve a work lost in Greek; examples of this include <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref>’s ‘Theophania’ and <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>’s ‘Homilies on Luke’. A number of secular writings whose Greek original is lost are preserved in Syriac translation, such as Themistius’s ‘On Virtue’ and Alexander of Aphrodisias’s ‘On the Universe (<i>kosmos</i>)’. Even where the Greek original survives the Syriac translation may often be of considerable importance for editors of the Greek, since the Syriac translations were not only made at a date much earlier than that of the earliest Greek mss., but also they are not infrequently preserved in mss. that date from the 6th and even 5th centuries. On the other hand, sometimes the earliest Syriac translations are so free that they are difficult to use for text-critical purposes, whereas it is the later translations, of the 6th and 7th centuries, which are the most useful, in view of their much more literal character.</p>
<p>During this half millennium of translation activity a marked shift in translation style can be observed, moving away from free and reader-oriented translations to literal and text-oriented ones; the culmination of this process occurred in the 7th cent., whereas during the ‘translation movement’ there was a return to a more reader-oriented approach. These changes in translation fashion led to many revisions being made of earlier translations.</p>
<p>1. Biblical: The earliest biblical translations from Greek were of <ref type="cr">Tatian</ref>’s <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref> (unless this was originally written in Syriac) and the <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Version</ref> (3rd cent.?). A revision of the Old Syriac, incorporating the rest of the Syriac canon of the New Testament, was made ca. 400, and this became the standard text of the Syriac Churches, eventually known as the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>. Subsequent revisions, confined to the Syr. Orth. tradition, were made in 508 (the lost ‘Philoxenian’, commissioned by <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>), and ca. 615 (the <ref type="cr">Ḥarqlean</ref>, made by <ref type="cr">Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref>); this last provided a mirror rendering of the Greek original.</p>
<p>Translations from the Greek Old Testament are confined to the Syr. Orth. tradition. Philoxenos may also have commissioned a translation of certain books of the Septuagint (fragments survive), but much more important is the <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref>, made by <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Tella</ref> ca. 615, from Origen’s revised Septuagint text. This covered the whole of the Septuagint, but does not survive complete. In the early 8th cent. <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> produced his own version of certain books, combining the Peshitta (made from Hebrew) with materials he had himself translated from Greek mss. of the Septuagint.</p>
<p>2. Patristic: The vast majority of surviving Syriac translations are of post-Nicene Greek Fathers, especially those of the 4th to 6th centuries. The Cappadocians, <ref type="cr">Basil</ref>, <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nyssa</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, are especially well represented, and even Gregory of Nazianzus’s poems got translated. In the Ch. of E. Theodore of Mopsuestia was regarded as the ‘Exegete’ par excellence, while among the Syr. Orth. it was Cyril of Alexandria and Severus who were held in particular honor. Since most 5th-cent. translations were free in character (and are sometimes paraphrases, rather than translations), a need was felt in the 6th and 7th cent. for either a revision of the earlier translation, or an entirely new one, keeping much closer to the Greek original. Thus the Homily collections of both Gregory of Nazianzus and Severus underwent thorough revisions in the 7th cent., the former undertaken by <ref type="cr">Pawla</ref> <ref type="cr">of</ref> <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> ca. 624, and the latter by Yaʿqub of Edessa towards the end of the century. The motivation for these revisions was sometimes the need for greater exactitude in the rendering of key theological terms, something which often resulted in the creation of neologisms in Syriac (an aspect commented upon by Yaʿqub of Edessa himself in his ‘Letter on Orthography’).</p>
<p>3. Secular: The earliest Syriac translations of Greek secular literature were in the area of popular philosophy with an ethical content, and were mostly made in the 5th cent. Surviving texts include works by Plutarch, Lucian, and Themistius. <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s influential ‘Eisagoge’, or Introduction to <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>’s logical works, known as the Organon, or ‘(intellectual) Tool’, along with much of the Organon itself, and several of <ref type="cr">Galen</ref>’s medical writings were first translated in the early 6th cent.; in this connection an important figure was the Archiatros <ref type="cr">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref>, the translator of the Dionysian Corpus. By the end of the 6th cent. many of these translations had also become known to scholars of the Ch. of E. in the Persian Empire. The 7th cent. witnessed further translations in these fields, as well as revisions of 6th-cent. translations; these were mostly the work of Syr. Orth. scholars such as <ref type="cr">Severos Sebokht</ref>, the Patriarch <ref type="cr">Athanasios  II</ref>, Yaʿqub of Edessa, and (in the early 8th cent.) <ref type="cr">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>.</p>
<p>The program of translating Greek philosophical, scientific, and medical literature, sponsored by the Abbasid Caliphs in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> in the late 8th and the 9th cent., involved scholars from all the Syr. Churches. Unfortunately, apart from that of Hippocrates’s Aphorisms, very little of these Syriac translations survives, though quotations from them can be found in subsequent Syriac encyclopedic literature (notably <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>) and in Arabic sources. Several of Patr. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>’s Letters include references to these translations. Although works by Aristotle feature prominently amongst those translated into Syriac, Plato’s writings are conspicuously absent.</p>
<p>In the course of the 9th–11th cent., when the Melkite Church replaced the Antiochian rite by the Constantinopolitan, a large number of liturgical (and a few hagiographical) texts were translated; amongst these, several poetic texts were subsequently taken over by the Syr. Orth.</p>

<p>Greek Church Father, and one of the three Cappadocian Fathers, whose influential writings earned him the title ‘the theologian’. He was appointed bp. of Constantinople during the Council there in 381, but he resigned shortly afterwards. Many of his writings were translated into Syriac, sometimes in two versions. The most important are:</p>
<p>1. 47 Homilies, or ‘Orations’ (<i>CPG</i> 3010, and Suppl.). There is an earlier version, preserved incomplete, and a thorough revision made by <ref type="cr">Pawla of Edessa</ref>, in 623/4 in Cyprus (whither he had fled from the Persian occupation of the eastern Byzantine provinces). Subsequent light revisions to this were made by <ref type="cr">Athanasios II</ref> and others. The following have been published so far (Greek numbering, the Syriac is different): Hom. 15, ‘On the Maccabees’, by R. L. Bensly and W. E. B. Barnes, <i>The Fourth Book of Maccabees</i> (1895), 55–73 (Pawla’s revision); Hom. 39 and 41, ‘On Epiphany and Pentecost’, by A. Malki, <i>Die syr. Hs Berlin Sachau 220</i> (1984), 153–76, 258–82 (Pawla’s revision); and in the Louvain Corpus Nazianzenum: Hom. 40, ‘On Baptism’ (2001); Hom. 13, ‘On Eulalius’, and 41, ‘On Pentecost’ (2002); Hom. 27, ‘Against the Eunomians’, 38, ‘On the Nativity’, and 39, ‘On Epiphany’ (2005); Homs. 28–31, ‘Theological Orations’ (2007), all providing both versions (further volumes are in preparation). The mss. of the two versions are described by A. Van Roey and H.  Moors, in <i>OLP</i> 4 (1973), 121–33; 5 (1974), 79–126, and by A. Schmidt and M. Quaschning-Kirsch, in <i>LM</i>113 (2000), 87–114. Pawla’s revision is always transmitted in two parts, 1–30 and 31–47. The Scholia (attached to the Homilies) explaining Gregory’s allusions to Greek mythology were edited, with ET, by S. P. Brock (1971), with both versions. Other scholia etc. were discussed by A. de Halleux, in <i>LM</i>98 (1985), 103–47; 103 (1990), 67–90, and by A. Schmidt, in <i>LM</i>111 (1998), 279–85. The Syriac revisions of the Homilies are mentioned by <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>, in Letters 17, 22, 42, and 43.</p>
<p>2. Letters (<i>CPG</i> 3032). According to <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (‘Book of Directions’, VII.9) 31 Letters circulated in Syriac translation, out of a much larger number in Greek. Smaller collections survive in two mss. of 8th/9th cent. (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,209 and 14,544), representing two different translations (unpublished).</p>
<p>3. Poems. The names of three translators are known, Candidatus of Amid (17 poems, done in 665, according to ms. Vat. Syr. 96), <ref type="cr">Theodosios of Edessa</ref>, a monk of the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref> and brother of Patr. <ref type="cr">Dionysios</ref>, done in 802, according to Bar ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, vol. I, col. 363; and a certain Gabriel, mentioned in Timotheos I, Letter 24. Candidatus is also mentioned in a funerary inscription of his granddaughter Mariam, dated Sept. 760 (in the Vatican Museum, ed. Guidi, <i>Actes,</i> <i>X Congrès des Orientalistes</i>, vol. 3 [1896], 73–82). A large collection of poems survives in ms. Vat. Syr. 105, ed. 
P. J. Bollig (1895), and smaller groupings in three mss. in the British Library, ed. H. Gismondi (1896). It is unclear whether any of these can be allocated to either Candidatus or Theodosios.</p>
<p>4. There is also a Syr. Orth. Anaphora attributed to Gregory (<i>CPG</i> 3097), ed. with LT, I. Hausherr, <i>Anaphorae Syriacae</i> I.2 (1940).</p>

<p>Cath. since 605. Grigor originated from Prat d-Maysh­an. Prior to his election he was a teacher of biblical interpretation at the School of <ref type="cr">Seleucia</ref>. The Persian authorities, or more specifically Queen Shirin, are said to have intervened in his election. One of the main internal problems Grigor had to deal with was the crisis in the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> surrounding the controversial leadership of <ref type="cr">Ḥenana of Adiabene</ref>. The synod convened by Grigor in 605 fully endorsed the commentaries (<i>puššāqe</i>) and writings of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> as the main and even the sole authority, against which no one had the right to introduce alternative views. This strong statement must have targeted Ḥenana and his followers. Other decisions of the synod deal with the problem of wandering or independent monks, both male and female, and with the need to bring monasteries under episcopal authority.</p>
<p>After Cath. Grigor’s death, which occurred between 608 and 611 (Vööbus, 316–7), the patriarchal throne was vacant until 628 (the death of Emperor Khusrau II). During this nearly twenty-year long interregnum, <ref type="cr">Babai the Great</ref> and Aba, Archdeacon of Seleucia, were in charge of the administration of the Ch. of E. From this period the <ref type="cr">Synodicon</ref> <ref type="cr">Orientale</ref> preserves a profession of faith that the bps. prepared for the Persian Emperor, in the context of a disputation with the Syr.

<p>Minor author, scribe and bp. of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> (1510/12–1537). He was born as Yawseph in <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> of an Iberian ancestry. Yawseph may have lost his parents at an early age, after which he was sent to <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> where he was cared for by Patr. Yuḥanon bar Shayullāh and the Patr.’s mother Mariam. Yawseph became a monk in 1490 and was ordained priest in 1495. He spent some time in Dayro d-ʿAzrael, then moved between Ḥesno d-Kifo, <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>. Impressed by his learning and zeal, bp. Yaʿqub of Amid called him ‘the pride of the church’.</p>
<p>In 1510/12, Yawseph was consecrated bp. of Jerusalem and environs, then including <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>, Aleppo, Ḥama, Tripoli, and parts of Ṣadad (with other parts being under the bp. of Nabk). As a bp., he took the name Grigorios. He managed to secure back mss. belonging to <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Mark</ref> which his predecessor, bp. 
Diosqoros Yaʿqub al-Yabrudī, had pawned. Grigorios visited the monasteries of Scetis (Egypt), including <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in 1516. On that occasion he compiled a list of the recent acquisitions of Syriac liturgical mss. in Dayr al-Suryān (see Leroy). He also visited Ṣadad in 1527, Amid in 1529–30, Aleppo in 1534, and Ṭur ʿAbdin in 1535. Earlier, a matrimonial case in Ṣadad caused a friction between him and Diosqoros ʿĪsā b. Ḥuriyya, bp. of Nabk and <ref type="cr">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabash</ref>ī.</p>
<p>At a general meeting of all the Christians of Jerusalem in 1527, Grigorios was chosen to represent Jerusalem’s Christian communities in talks with the governor of Damascus, Lutfi Pasha. Shortly after, Grigorios obtained from the Pasha an edict to protect the civil rights of the Syr. Orth., Greek, Coptic, Armenian, Maron., and E.-Syr. Christians. During his bishopric, Grigorios obtained ca. ten governmental edicts from various officials, ensuring the rights of the Syr. Orth. in the Holy Places, the civil rights of all Christians in Palestine, and some in support of his ecclesiastical domain over the Syr. Orth. and their ‘Maronite and Nestorian followers’ (sic).</p>
<p>In 1532, Grigorios purchased a property from a Muslim named Yūsef b. Marʿī near Damascus Gate, Jerusalem, and established there a monastery which he called ‘The Gregorian Patriarchal Monastery of Jerusalem’ (a.k.a. Dayr al-ʿAdas). Grigorios died in Aleppo in 1537 and was buried at the Church of the Virgin.</p>

<Author>G. A. Kiraz</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Guidi, Ignazio</head><ab type="infobox"/>(1844–1935) 
<p>Italian Syriac scholar. One of the most eminent scholars in the philology of Semitic and Eastern Christian literatures, he taught at the University of Rome from 1876 to 1919. Although since 1885 he devoted most of his energy to Ethiopian studies, he also offered important contributions to Syriac scholarship, particularly textual studies, such as his editions — mostly accompanied by annotated translations — of the first ‘Letter on the Ḥimyarite martyrs’ by <ref type="cr">Shemʿun of Beth Arsham</ref> (1881); of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>’s homily ‘on the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus’ (1884–85); of <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>’s letter to the monks of Tell ʿAda (1886); of the Statutes of the<ref type="cr"> School of Nisibis</ref> (1891), reedited decades later by A. Vööbus; of two fundamental historiographical works, the 6th cent. <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Edessa</ref> (1903) and the 7th cent. ‘Chronicle of Khuzistan’ (a.k.a. ‘Guidi’s Anonymous Chronicle’, 1892 and 1903); of the Syriac Acts of the martyr Judas Cyriacus (1904); of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref>’s Cathedral Homilies XCIX to CIII in <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>’s translation (PO 22.2, 1930). He is also to be credited with the discovery and first presentation of the E.-Syr. <ref type="cr">Synodicon</ref> (1889), subsequently edited and translated by <ref type="cr">J.-B. Chabot</ref> and <ref type="cr">O. Braun</ref>, and with a series of critical remarks (1892) on, as well as the indispensable hagiographical index (1919) to, <ref type="cr">P. Bedjan</ref>’s seven-volume <i>Acta Martyrum et Sanctorum</i>. Only the first two substantial items of this selection of his essays were reprinted in his <i>Raccolta di scritti</i>, vol. 1. <i>Oriente cristiano I</i>(Rome 1945, unfortunately interrupted after the first installment). Guidi also published brilliant essays on specific literary and historical themes connected with Syriac studies, such as his famous Paris lecture ‘L’historiographie chez les Sémites’ (1906), his Cairo lectures published as ‘L’Arabie anté-islamique’ (1921), and a steady stream of book reviews. In the course of a very busy life he formed relationships of friendly collaboration with several scholars belonging to the Syr. Churches staying in Rome for longer periods, such as the future Syr. Catholic Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref>, the Maron. priest <ref type="cr">Gabriel Cardahi</ref>, and his Chaldean informers on a North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic dialect of Iraq, of which he published in his youth a succint linguistic description and two short texts (1883). No full list of his writings is available: the one up to 1911 in <i>Rivista degli Studi Orientali</i> 5 (1913), 77–89, was never completed and updated. The considerable library of Guidi combined with that of his Arabist son Michelangelo, which includes a rich collection of rare Syriac text editions, is now housed in the Department of Oriental Studies of the University of Rome ‘La Sapienza’.</p>

<p>Syriac scholar, specialist of Eastern Christian asceticism and monasticism. Antoine Guillaumont studied classics in Montpellier. Between periods of mobilization in the army, he obtained his <i>agrégation de lettres classiques</i> in 1943. He taught for two years in the Lycée of Monaco and subsequently was admitted to the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. He also took up a tenured teaching position at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, first in Hebrew and <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref>, later in Eastern Christianity. In 1977, he was elected a professsor in the prestigious College de France (1977–86), with a chair dedicated to ‘Christianity and Gnoses in the Pre-Islamic East’. In 1983, he became a member of the French Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. With his main focus on asceticism, he first turned to Coptic documents and particularly to the Sahidic fragments of the Coptic version of the ‘Asceticon’ of Abba Isaiah (<ref type="cr">Isaiah of Scetis</ref>), which he published in 1956. His entire life was dedicated to a better understanding of asceticism, monasticism, and withdrawal from the world. As part of the broader cultural environment from which the ascetic movement emerged, he studied biblical texts from the Hellenistic period, which led to his collaboration on several books (Maccabees, Proverbs, Qohelet, the additions to Esther, Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon) for the French translation of the Bible edited by E. Dhorme (1956–59). He also collaborated on Psalms for the <i>Traduction œcuménique de la Bible</i> (1975). He studied various gnostic texts and contributed to the first edition and translation of the ‘Gospel of Thomas’ (1959). Most of his studies, conferences, courses, and publications were dedicated to notions of asceticism, withdrawal, solitary life, spiritual fight, and <i>acedia</i>(‘listlessness’), which he studied in ascetic literature, including the ‘History of the Monks of Egypt’, the ‘Sayings of the Desert Fathers’ (Apophthegmata), the ‘Lausiac History’, and the Syriac ‘<ref type="cr">Book of Steps</ref>’, as well as in archeological remains in Northern Syria and Egypt. Of particular significance are his editions of the works of <ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>, based on the Greek and Eastern, especially Syriac sources. He published the ‘Kephalaia Gnostica’ (1958) as well as the following together with his wife Claire: the ‘Practical Treatise’ (1971), the ‘Gnosticon’ (1989), and (in collaboration with P. Géhin) ‘On the Thoughts’ (SC 438; 1998). He also published an important monograph on the ‘Kephalaia Gnostica’ (1962), in which he traced the far-reaching influence of Origenism and Evagrianism in Syr. Christianity, including such authors as <ref type="cr">Babai the Great</ref> in the E.-Syr. and <ref type="cr">Sṭephanos bar Ṣudayli</ref> in the W.-Syr. tradition. His last and posthumous book, <i>Un philosophe au désert, Évagre le Pontique</i> (2004) is the culmination of his work on this important philosopher. For Guillaumont the literary study of these texts could not be disconnected from the places where ascetics lived. Using the texts and gleaning information from them, he was able to identify the site of Kellia, a center of eremitic life situated between Scetis and Nitria, where Evagrius lived during 14 years. Guillaumont directed archeological campaigns in Kellia from 1965 to 1969. In addition to the publication of the archeological reports, this archeological experience also formed the background for his volumes <i>Aux origines du monachisme chrétien</i> (1979) and <i>Études sur la spiritualité de l’Orient Chrétien</i> (1996), in which a number of his papers are brought together. A Festschrift was presented to him in 1988.</p>

<p>Notable Iraqi scholar, priest and educator. Yusuf Habbi was born in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> on 23 Dec. 1938. After attending the Chaldean Seminary School in Mosul he was sent to Rome (1954) to study, first at the Urbinian University, and then at the Lateran University where he wrote his doctorate (1966) on Patr. Yawsep Audo. On his return to Iraq (1967) he was engaged in both pastoral and academic work. In 1972, with some colleagues he founded the periodical <i>Bayn</i> <i>al</i>-<i>nahrayn</i>, of which he remained an editor until his death in a car accident the night of 14/15 Oct. 2000. Also in 1972 he was elected to the Syriac Academy (later, the Syriac Corporation of the Iraqi Academy). From 1975–81 he taught Syriac and French at Mosul University, and then in 1982 he was appointed Associate Professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute, Rome. From 1991 he was closely involved with the raising of the Patriarchal Seminary in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> to a Pontifical Faculty, named the Babel College of Philosophy and Theology, of which he became President. Particularly notable among his many publications was the edition of <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>’s newly discovered ‘Book of Signs’ (1987). Besides writing two histories of the Ch. of E. (1989, 2001; both in Arabic), he published a new edition of the ‘Catalogue’ of <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> (1986), and Arabic translations of various <ref type="cr">chronicles</ref> (<ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref>, 1975; <i>Chronica Minora</i>, 1983), and of the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref> (1999).

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Hagiography</LemmaTitle>
<p>Literature that tells the stories of saints. Hagiography was not biography, even though often including such material. Rather, its purpose was to present its subjects in terms that made clear their holiness. Hence it employed literary conventions, motifs, and themes that identified its men or women with biblical models, and above all with gospel models of Christ. The saint was always presented as one who imitated Christ, whether by works of healing, teaching, or ministry in life, or by a holy death. It could be written about historical persons or legendary figures, but always it presented and conformed the holy person’s life and works to familiar models that emerged over the late antique period: the holy bishop, abbot, or monk; the holy nun, widow, or penitent harlot; the holy layman or laywoman who lived an exceptional life of good works and asceticism. Syriac hagiography emerged as a sophisticated literary genre during the 5th cent. and took various forms: individual lives (<i>vitae</i>) of saints, resembling biographical narratives and deeply influenced by Greek biographical traditions, such as those about <ref type="cr">Rabbula of Edessa</ref> or <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>; collections of saints’ stories, often short vignettes, including personal encounters, such as <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>’s ‘Lives of the Eastern Saints’ (W. Syr., written 560s) or <ref type="cr">Toma of Marga</ref>’s ‘Book of Governors’ 
(E. Syr., 9th cent.); personal memoirs, such as <ref type="cr">Sahdona</ref>’s of the 7th cent. holy woman Shirin (E. Syr.). Saints’ stories traveled freely across linguistic, geographical, and political boundaries in the ancient Christian world. Thus hagiography appeared in literary forms that mutually interacted across languages. Hagiographical writings about Syr. saints were written in Greek (e.g., by <ref type="cr">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref>) as well as Syriac, and both kinds might be translated into Latin and further into other languages. The Edessan Martyrs, Shemʿun the Stylite, St. Febronia of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, the anonymous <ref type="cr">Man of God</ref> (later named Alexius), and St. Pelagia the harlot, are figures both historical and legendary whose stories, originating in Syriac, are found in every major calendar of Christian saints. In turn, there is a large body of hagiography translated into Syriac from other languages, already during the 5th and 6th cent., beginning with <ref type="cr">Athanasius</ref>’s ‘Life of Antony’, ‘the Sayings of the Desert Fathers’, and Theodoret of Cyrrhus’s ‘History of the Monks of Syria’.</p>

<Author>S. A. Harvey</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Hakkari
</LemmaTitle><p>The region in the southeast corner of Turkey dominated by the mountains Cilo Dag (4170 m.) and Sat Dag (3810 m.), and the highlands around them, cut by the gorges of the Great Zab River and its tributaries. The spelling <i>Hakkiari</i> is also found in English sources. In modern Turkey <i>Hakkâ</i><i>ri</i> is the name of a province and of its capital town, the former Julamerk (Cölemerik). There is no Christian population now (only more or less ruined churches), but until 1915 Hakkari was the homeland of the majority of Christians belonging to the Ch. of E.</p>
<p>Within what is now Hakkari the dioceses of Beth Dasen and Beth Bgash are known from the 5th cent., and the evidence of local saints, such as Mar Zayʿa whose cult was in Jilu, may take the church history of the region back to the 4th cent. But there is a long period of silence until ca. 1400 when, according to tradition, Hakkari was populated by Christians from ‘Assyria’, that is, the <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> plain, fleeing the ravages of Timur. The earliest report of a patr. of the Ch. of E. in Hakkari (in the village of Khananis near Kochanes) dates from 1617–19, although the official tradition of the church credits the removal of the patriarchal see to Hakkari to a Patr. Denḥa (numbered as Mar Shemʿon XIII or XV) who held office 1662–1700.</p>
<p>The majority population of Hakkari was always Kurdish, and until the mid-19th century, Assyrian Christians were subject to the local Kurdish chiefs with their fortresses at Julamerk and Bashkale. Well-documented massacres of Christians in 1843–46 were partly the consequence of intra-Kurdish wars, another consequence of which was the gradual imposition of Turkish rule on the region. Officially, Hakkari was a <i>sanjak</i> within the <i>vilayet</i>of Van (except 1880–88 when it was itself a <i>vilayet</i>) with the seat of the local governor (<i>mutessarif</i>) at Bashkale. Even so, only the so-called <i>rayat</i> areas on the periphery of Hakkari were subject to direct Turkish rule. In central Hakkari were the ‘<i>ashiret</i>’ areas in which the central government operated only through the Patr. Mar Shemʿon, from whom taxes were collected and to whom a salary was paid (both irregularly). A reasonable estimate in 1886 put the population of Hakkari at 70,000 Kurds and 50,000 Assyrian Christians (although higher numbers of Christians were often quoted).</p>
<p>The principal Assyrian <i>rayat</i> areas were: Gawar, Shamsdin (including the village of Marbishu), Berwar, and Bashkale. The <i>ashiret</i> districts were: Upper Tiari, Lower Tiari (including the vilage of Ashitha), Tkhuma, Baz, and Jilu. Each of the <i>ashiret</i> populations, usually called tribes, was autonomous under its <i>malek</i> (chief). The Patr.’s village of Kochanes and a few other groups of villages (Walto, Tal, Diz) were also part of the <i>ashiret</i> area, although not always considered ‘tribal’. The <i>malek</i>s owed a feudal allegiance to the Patr. but were often disaffected. Differences among the dress, dialect, and even physiognomy of the tribes were generally commented on by Western writers. Even today and even in the <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref> tribal identities are strong among Assyrians. The membership of the Ancient Church of the East, for example, has a large proportion of Lower Tiari families.</p>
<p>The want of good government in Hakkari is a theme in 19th-cent. reports on the area. Christians and Kurds managed a tense coexistence, but it was characterized by continual feuds, disputes over sheep-stealing, and robbery of each other and of travellers. Christian grievances were directed more often at the Turkish government than the Kurds. The government was, however, by nature hostile to Christians as a disloyal non-Muslim element in the population, and the fact that their grievances were often channeled through western missionaries and consular officials increased this hostility.</p>
<p>Ethnic cleansing began in Oct. 1914 with an order for the deportation of Christians from Hakkari. With the outbreak of war, this became during 1914–15 an organized destruction of <i>rayat</i> villages by Turkish troops with the assistance of Kurdish irregulars, in which many Assyrian civilians were killed. Apparently after a decision by the Assyrians in May 1915 to join the war on the Russian and British side, a full-scale campaign against them was launched by Haydar Bey, the <i>vali</i> of Mosul. Heavy fighting drove the Assyrian remnant to retreat into the high mountains, and then to escape as best they could into Persia. At the end of Sept. 1915 it was reported that 25,000 had reached Salmas (north of <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref>), including Mar Shimun. The men of Jilu had withdrawn to Persia earlier in the year, and in all an estimated 40,000 Assyrians from Hakkari eventually found their way to Urmia.</p>
<p>There were attempts to resettle the area by the Assyrian mountaineers in 1920 and 1922–24. The latter ended with the Turkish army driving the settlers back over the Iraqi border. When in July 1925 this border was drawn by the League of Nations and Hakkari finally awarded to Turkey, there was an end to ideas of return to the old homeland.</p>

<p>Professor of Syriac and Arabic, Syriac scholar. Al-Ḥāqilānī studied at the Maronite College in Rome from 1620 to 1628 and concluded this period with the publication of a short Syriac grammar (<i>Linguae syriacae sive chaldaicae institutio</i>, 1628), intended for students of the Maronite College who had difficulty with the high academic level of <ref type="cr">Jirjis ʿAmīra</ref>’s grammar. Upon his return to Lebanon, he started working as a diplomat for the Emir Fakhr al-Dīn who, in his resistance against the Ottomans, forged an alliance between the Maronites and the Druzes, but was captured (1634) and executed in Istanbul. Fakhr al-Dīn’s demise forced al-Ḥāqilānī to return to Italy, where he taught Arabic and Syriac at the Sapienza College in Rome, spent some time in Florence, and was appointed professor of oriental languages at Pisa. In the 1630s he was involved in the Paris Polyglot, to which he contributed the Syr. and Arabic text of the book of Ruth, with LT, and the Arabic text of 3 Maccabees. In or around 1645 al-Ḥāqilānī was appointed professor at the Collège Royal (the later Collège de France) in Paris. In 1653 he returned to Rome, where he taught on behalf of the ‘Propaganda Fide’, before being appointed, in 1660, Scriptor of the Vatican Library. In this position he prepared the first catalogue of Syriac and Arabic mss. He died in 1664.</p>
<p>In the field of Syriac studies, in addition to his Syriac grammar (1628) and his contribution to the Paris Polyglot, he published an annotated translation of the ‘Catalogue of books’ by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (1653). He also copied some Syriac mss., in particular Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 6 (biblical books), 248 (philosophical texts), 249 (<ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s translation of Avicenna’s introduction to logic), and 253 (Lexicon of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿAli</ref>).</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Ḥarqlean Version</LemmaTitle> 
<p>The last Syriac version of the NT, prepared by <ref type="cr">Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref> (Syr. Orth.) 615/16 in the <ref type="cr">Enaton</ref> near Alexandria (Egypt). This version is a recension (<i>turroṣo</i>) of the NT, with numerous Greek variant readings (translated into Syriac) quoted in the margins or with asterisks in the main text. The recensional method of the Ḥarqlean Version was inherited from Origen’s Hexaplaric Septuagint recension (the Syriac translation of which is the <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref>). The Syro-Hexapla therefore can contribute to the proper understanding of the Ḥarqlean version’s features and intention. Historically, both versions are parts of the same translation project the Syr. Miaphysites initiated in the second decade of the 7th cent. According to the subscriptions of the Ḥarqlean Gospels (Kiraz, <i>CESG</i>, vol. 4, 369), Acts, and the Pauline epistles, the translation was executed ‘at the Enaton of (i.e., near) Alexandria, the great city, in the holy Convent of the Antonines … in the year 927 of Alexander, in the fourth indiction (i. e., 615/16)’. The Ḥarqlean Version is mentioned by <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> in his ‘Storehouse of Secrets’ (<i>Awṣar roze</i>), proem, in his Ecclesiastical History (I,50 = vol. 1, col. 267), and by <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, Chronicle, X,25 = vol. IV 391.</p>
<label type="subsection">The Characteristic Features</label>
<p>The characteristic features of the Ḥarqlean version are the decisive turn towards the Greek (‘mirror translation’) and the introduction of the philological and thus ‘critical’ dimension into the history of the Syriac NT. The method of recension sketched in the subscriptions remains ambiguous (esp. the role of the Philoxenian); the result, however, is clear: Tumo prepared a NT text that did not exist before; i.e. he produced a recension of the NT. This recension was based on a translation of an existing Greek model and supplemented by textual material drawn from additional Greek mss. In the same way, the Syro-Hexapla is based on an existing Greek model (the Hexaplaric Septuagint recension) and supplemented by textual material drawn from Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion (and others). The new philological and ‘critical’ dimension is provided by the <i>distinctive</i> presentation of the additional material. It is located in the margins or in the main text (marked with asterisks) in order not to mix the textual traditions put together in this recension. This <i>distinctive</i> presentation allows the additional material to be read in context as variants of the <i>Graeca veritas</i>. Additions to and omissions from Tumo’s Greek model could be presented in the main text; exchanges of words or passages had to be presented in the margin and connected to the corresponding word in the text by a graphic sign. The <i>obelos</i> is used for the sake of translation technique to mark Syriac words which do not match the Greek <i>Vorlage</i> but are necessary for an intelligible rendering of the Greek. By this way of quoting the additional material and using ‘critical’ signs, Tumo is a pupil of Origen; from a modern point of view, he attached a ‘critical’ apparatus to his version. Of course Tumo was not a modern critic, but he was aware of the non-uniformity of the Greek text. He knew about different textual traditions and that translating a single Greek ms. (like <ref type="cr">Polykarpos</ref>, who prepared the Philoxenian) would provide only an imperfect knowledge of the Greek NT text.</p>
<p>Besides the recensional features, a revisional relation between the Ḥarqlean Version and the Philoxenian is reported in the subscriptions of the Ḥarqlean Version. Although this report is not detailed enough, Tumo could have used the earlier version as the starting point of his own. An attractive feature of the earlier version was its relation to Caesarea in Palestine and to the famous library of Pamphilus, which is reported in the Ḥarqlean subscription to the Pauline letters. A revisional relation to the Philoxenian would have brought Tumo’s own version in line with the Caesarean origin of the Syro-Hexapla and would have supplied the whole Miaphysite translation project with one uniform authority.</p>
<label type="subsection">The Historical Setting</label>
<p>As J. Gwynn suggested (‘Paulus [48] Tellensis’, <i>DCB</i> 4 [1887], 266–71, at 267), the instigative historical setting of the laborious translation project could have been the reunion of the Syrian and Coptic Miaphysites after decades of schisma dating from the time of the Syrian Patr. <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref> (581–91) and the Coptic Patriarch Damian (578–606). Although no proof can be given, Gwynn’s suggestion is supported by the common date 616 for the reunion and the completion of the Ḥarqlean Version. This suggestion, however, puts a special linguistic perspective on the Ḥarqlean Version. The reunion had to be performed completely in Greek; and both parties had to determine the authoritative Greek text of the Scriptures for reunion. This text had to be of ‘ecumenical’, not of local currency. For the OT, Origen’s Hexaplaric Septuagint recension (handed down by Pamphilus and <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref>) could easily be accepted by both parties; for the NT, no such work of Origen existed, and the text had to be determined by the Miaphysites themselves. This text became the Greek model of the Ḥarqlean Version. According to this perspective, the Ḥarqlean Version came into being after the determination of the Greek model as the translation and inner-Syriac promulgation of the approved Greek NT text. The recensional as well as the revisional imprint on the Ḥarqlean version were added during or after translation, when comparison with additional Greek mss. (and with the Philoxenian) was made. Another possibility is that the Ḥarqlean margin was already an integral part of the Greek text established by the Syrian and Coptic Miaphysites in order to quote (i.e. to include into the reunion) different textual traditions of both parties.</p>
<label type="subsection">The History of the Version Reflected by the Mss.</label>
<p>After the rise of Islam, the version’s ‘ecumenical’ frame of reference was lost and the version itself was considered as the ‘Greek’ (Bar ʿEbroyo in his Scholia to the NT). The ‘ecumenical’ perspective of the Ḥarqlean Version was replaced by a scientific and philological attitude. Due to the complicated lay-out of the version, not all scribes were capable of transmitting the text properly; some of them omitted the marginal quotations and the <i>asterisks</i>/<i>obeloi</i> completely, thus mixing the readings Tumo intended to keep separate. The philologists were not interested in preserving the original text but in updating it according to the current Greek text of the New Testament, which was the increasingly dominant Byzantine text. This development created ‘corrected’ models (hyparchetypes) and faded out the original non- and pre- Byzantine part of the version.</p>
<p>Due to the large number of mss., the revisional development can be traced best in the Gospel mss. The total is ca. 100 from the 8th to the 19th cent., but only ca. 20 mss. are furnished with the marginal and asterisked additions. Ms. Vat. Syr. 268 (8th/9th cent.) is singled out by an undeveloped stage of text, which preserved a large number of non-Byzantine readings. The majority of the witnesses reflect the version’s development towards the Greek Byzantine text; unfortunately, the oldest dated ms. of the Gospels (ms. Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana Plut. I.40; 757) is of this type. This first revisional stage of the 
version is well represented in further mss. of the first millen­nium, e.g. by Vat. Syr. 267 (8th cent.), Harvard Syr.  16 (8th/9th cent.), Brit. Libr. Add. 7163 (9th/10th  cent.), Mingana Syr. 124 (9th/10th cent.), and Chester Beatty Syr. 3 (1177, copied from a model of 841).</p>
<p>In the 12th cent. the revisional development entered a new stage with the activity of <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> (d. 1171). Again, Gospel mss. provide the information. The subscriptions, which report his revision (ms. Oxford, New Coll. 334; 12th/13th cent. and London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,124; 1233/34; see Wright, <i>Catalogue … British Museum</i>, vol. 1, 42) do not mention Greek mss.; it probably relies on several ‘corrected’ models of the version itself. Essential features are the further reduction of the marginal readings and critical signs (though some completely new are added), the inversion of many text/margin readings, and the introduction of the Pericope on the Adulteress (Jn 7:53–8:11).</p>
<p>The extreme rarity of mss. for Acts and the Epistles prevents us from tracing a revisional development in these parts of the NT. There are only two mss. from the first millennium, ms. Jerusalem, St. Mark 37 (Pauline epistles) and ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,474 (Catholic Epistles), which are of the 9th cent. Two later mss. cover the entire NT with the exception of Revelation: ms. Cambridge, Add. 1700 (1069/70) and ms. Oxford, New Coll. 333 (12th/13th cent.). Fortunately, all except the Cambridge ms. are furnished with marginal and asterisked variants. Revelation is represented by ca. ten late mss., among which Mardin Orth. 36/2 (13th cent., ed. by A. Vööbus as no. 35/2) is furnished with a subscription and with the full range of marginal and asterisked variants. Important steps in the version’s history are: 1.  the creation of a ‘Passiontide Harmony’ composed of literal segments of the single Gospels. It is from the 9th cent. and attributed to Daniel of Beth Baṭin (near <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>); 2. the <i>liturgical</i> use of the version, which entered the lectionaries. This gives color to the version’s appreciation among the Syrians as the ‘correct’ and ‘ecumenical’ text of the NT; 3. the adoption of the version by the <ref type="cr">Masora</ref> (connected with the <ref type="cr">Qarqaphto</ref> monastery near <ref type="cr">Reshʿayna</ref>) in the 8th/9th cent.; 4. the production of <i>bilingual</i> codices in Syriac/Arabic <ref type="cr">Garshuni</ref> (e.g. Vat. Syr. 271 and Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 57); and 5. the attachment of extensive exegetical scholia taken from patristic authorities (e.g. Mingana Syr. 105 and 480; Manchester, J. Rylands Univ. Library, no. 10).</p>
<label type="subsection">The History of Research</label>
<p>The history of research started with the <i>Editio princeps</i> published by Joseph White 1778–1803; it was based mainly on one single ms. (New Coll. 333, with variants of mss. New Coll. 334 and Bodl. Or. 361). From the very beginning scholars were confronted with the question of the version’s identity (Philoxenian or Ḥarqlean). According to White’s interpretation of the subscriptions it was the Philoxenian version he published, which <ref type="cr">Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref> reissued by only attaching the marginal and asterisked readings. G. H. Bernstein in 1837 considered White’s text to be a separate version, though a thorough revision, of the Philoxenian. The question remained open until the publication of Philoxenos’s late writings, which provided genuine Philoxenian quotations of the NT (especially his commentary on the prologue of St. John’s Gospel, ed. by A. de Halleux [CSCO 380, 1977]). Bernstein’s view turned out to be substantially correct; the <ref type="cr">Philoxenian version</ref> itself is considered lost.</p>
<p>A new approach to the Greek background of the Ḥarqlean Version was launched by B. Aland, who successfully reconstructed the Greek <i>Vorlage</i> of the Ḥarqlean major Catholic Epistles and the writings of Paul. The version’s Greek model can be traced to a group of 10th–15th-cent. minuscule mss. (1611, 1505, 2138, 2495 according to Gregory and Aland), the ancestry of which is not a descendent of the Greek model itself but of a ms. akin to this model having a common 5th/6th-cent. ancestry (B. Aland 1986, introduction). The knowledge of the Greek model opened a new perspective on Tumo’s method of revison, with two principal issues: 1. Tumo is a <i>translator</i>, who faithfully follows his Greek <i>Vorlage</i>; the marginal and asterisked annotations derive from different Greek mss., which supply the version with variant readings of the <i>Graeca veritas</i>; 2. the revisional relation to the Philoxenian (reported in the subscriptions) is rather on the Syriac than on the Greek level. There was a shift from a fairly exact rendering to a ‘mirror translation’; the Greek background of both versions largely remained the same. These results derive from a text-critical study and from a reedition of the Ḥarqlean Version, which is based on a new important ms. (Jerusalem, St. Mark 37; 9th cent.). G. Zuntz’s still dominant approach to the revisional relation between the Philoxenian and Ḥarqlean versions is solely based on an interpretation of the subscriptions and guided too much by the term ‘revision’ instead of ‘translation’.</p>
<label type="subsection">Editions</label>
<p>The complex structure of the Ḥarqlean Version, its liability to distortion, the revisional development, and the scanty attestation of the Praxapostolos confront editors with not a few problems. Not surprisingly, most of the Ḥarqlean editions are one-ms.-publications. A comprehensive critical edition of the Gospels, which sets out the revisional development of the version in some detail, is much to be desired. Ḥarqlean texts published so far are: L. de Dieu, <i>Apocalypsis Sancti Iohannis</i>(Leiden, 1627) (ms. Hebr. Scal. 18); J. White, <i>Sacrorum Evangeliorum Versio Philoxeniana ...</i>, vol. 1, 1–2 (Oxford, 1778) (Gospels); 
vol. 2, 1–2 (Oxford, 1799/1803) (Acts and Letters) (ms. New Coll. 333, with variants of mss. New Coll. 334 and Bodl. Or. 361 [all Oxford]); G. H.  Bernstein, <i>Das heilige Evangelium des Iohannes. Syrisch in harklensischer Übersetzung  …</i>(Leipzig, 1853) (ms. Vat. Syr. 271); R. L. Bensly, <i>The Harklean version of the Epistle to the Hebrews, chapter XI,28–XIII,25</i> (Cambridge, 1889) (ms. Cambridge, Add. 1700); M. A. Weigelt, <i>Diatessaric Harmonies on the Passion Narrative in the Harclean Syriac Version</i> (Ph.D. Diss.; 1969) (based on mss. Vat. Syr. 268; London, Brit. Libr. Add. 18,714; Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 31, 51 and 52; Cambridge, Add. 1700); A. Vööbus, <i>The Apocalypse in the Harklean version</i> (CSCO 400; 1978) (ms. Mardin Orth. 35/2 [i.e. 36/2]); B. Aland and A. Juckel, <i>Das Neue Testament in syrischer Überlieferung</i> I (1986) (James, 1 Peter, 1 John; according to mss. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,474; Oxford, New Coll. 333; Cambridge, Add. 1700); B. Aland and

<Author>A. Juckel</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Ḥarran 
</LemmaTitle><p>Syr./Hebrew Ḥārān; Latin Carrhae; Arabic Ḥarran. Ancient city in Mesopotamia, approximately 45 km south-southeast of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. Residence, for brief periods in the 8th cent., of Syr. Orth. patriarchs. The first city built after the Flood according to a tradition recorded by the Arab geographer Yāqūt in his <i>Muʿjam al-buldān</i> and the place where Abraham and his family sojourned according to the Book of Genesis, Ḥarran had become known as a center for the cult of the moon god Sin by the 14th cent. BC. Because of its strategic importance as a frontier town, the Christian emperors usually refrained from interfering in the religious life of Ḥarran, which remained a stronghold of paganism. When the pilgrim Egeria visited Ḥarran in 383, the town had a Christian bp., and the house of Abraham, which stood outside the city, had been turned into a church, but the population of the city, she tells us, probably with some exaggeration, was wholly pagan. The Greek Fathers refer to Ḥarran as Hellenopolis, ‘the city of the (pagan) Greeks’; the Syriac <ref type="cr">Life of Ephrem</ref>likewise calls it ‘the city of the pagans’ (<i>Ḥārān mdittā d-ḥanpe</i>). Some have argued that it was in Ḥarran that Simplicius and his Neoplatonist companions settled upon their return from Persia where they had sought refuge after the closure of their school in Athens by Justinian in 529. Taken by the Arabs in 639/40, Ḥarran briefly became the seat of the caliphate under the last (eastern) Umayyad Marwān II (744–750). It was probably early on under Arab rule, before the 8th cent., that the Syriac work entitled the ‘Prophecies of the pagan philosophers in brief’ was written, inviting the pagans of Ḥarran to convert to Christianity. According to Ibn al-Nadīm, it was at the time of a visit by Caliph al-Maʾmūn in 830 that the people of the town identified themselves with the Sabians (Ṣābiʾ) mentioned in the Qurʾān, so as to escape persecution by claiming to be a ‘people of the book’. Ḥarran was considered a center of pagan Greek learning under the Abbasids, especially for the mathematical sciences. The Ḥarranians were probably the last group of non-Christians who continued to use <ref type="cr">Syriac</ref>. In his Lexicon, <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>refers to the Syriac dialect specific to Ḥarran. <ref type="cr">Thābit b. Qurra</ref> (836–901), the most famous of the ‘Sabian’ scholars, still wrote some of his works in Syriac, which were known to and were quoted by <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>. Ḥarran became the principal seat of the Numayrids in the 11th cent. and remained an important city under the Artuqids, Zangids, and Ayyubids, but more or less disappears from history after it was taken by the Mongols in 1260 and was evacuated by them in 1271.</p>
<p>The first known bp. of the city is Barses, who was made metropolitan of Edessa in 361. His successors include Vitus, who attended the Council of Constantinople in 381, Daniel, a cousin of <ref type="cr">Hiba</ref> of Edessa (attested 444, 449), and John, who was at the Council of Chalcedon (451). At least three of their Chalcedonian successors would engage in writing against the Miaphysites, namely Constantine and Leon in the 8th cent. — who received replies in Syriac from a Miaphysite bp. called <ref type="cr">Eliya</ref> — and, more famously, <ref type="cr">Theodoros Abū Qurra</ref> (ca. 755 – ca. 830).</p>
<p>As Miaphysite bishops of Ḥarran before the Arab conquest, we know of Yuḥanon (mentioned in 502/3, banished by Emperor Justin in 519), Sergius bar Karyo (ca. 557 – ca. 578, translator of <ref type="cr">John bar Aphtonia</ref>’s biography of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> into Syriac), and Shemʿun (in 617/8). Before the Arab conquest, the main Syr. Orth. church in Ḥarran was confiscated and given to the Melkites by Emperor Maurice (582–602). Later, we hear of a new Syr. Orth. cathedral being completed just before 700. Bp. Iwannis of Ḥarran (d. 755) was elected Patr. in 740 on the eve of the transfer of the caliphate to Ḥarran. Of his two successors as patr., both later considered illegitimate, Isḥaq (755–56) had also been bp. of Ḥarran, and Athanasios Sandaloyo (756–58) was murdered in Ḥarran. Bp. Dawid of Ḥarran (attested 847, 874) may be the author of the Syriac Chronicle of 846 (Palmer, <i>The seventh century in the West-Syrian chronicles</i>, 83). The last known Syr. Orth. bp. of Ḥarran is Ephrem, heard of when the Armenians asked for access to an altar in the Syr. Orth. church in Ḥarran in 1252.</p>
<p>The E.-Syr. see of Ḥarran, attested between the 7th and 11th cent. and suffragan to <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, counted among its occupants the canonist <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</ref>(early 9th  cent.) and the future Cath. Sabrishoʿ II (transferred from Ḥarran to Damascus before 823, then Cath. 831–835).</p>
<p>Among the ruins of Ḥarran, dotted today with beehive-shaped adobe houses of the Bedouin Arabs who settled here in the 19th cent., are those of a large basilica church located near the northeastern end of the oval-shaped medieval city.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Harris, James Rendel</head><ab type="infobox"/>(1852–1941)
<p>British New Testament scholar, Syriac scholar, textual critic, and paleographer, who was instrumental in creating the modern field of Syriac Studies. Although he started his academic career at Cambridge as a mathematician, he soon discovered a life long interest in Christian origins and New Testament studies that eventually led to an appointment in paleography at Cambridge (UK), as well as positions in Biblical Languages and Ecclesiastical History at Haverford College (USA), New Testament at Johns Hopkins (USA), and as curator of mss. at the John Rylands Library in Manchester (UK). Before and after his time in Manchester, Rendel Harris served as director of the Woodbrooke Institute, Birmingham (UK), where he was able to combine his love for ancient textual studies and Quaker spirituality.</p>
<p>Rendel Harris was an independent thinker and was often considered idiosyncratic in his scholarship. He did not allow prevailing trends in Early Christian Studies to necessarily guide his own research. For instance, he was a very early advocate of understanding the beginnings of Christianity to descend both from Second Temple and post-70 CE Judaism(s), all the while pursuing the ways and means that these early Christian writers then separated themselves from those same forms of Judaism. He willingly pursued the social history behind the variant textual traditions he studied.</p>
<p>Rendel Harris’s abiding interest in collecting, editing and decoding ancient Christian manuscripts, Greek and Latin as well as Coptic, Syriac, Armenian, and Persian, led him on travels all over the Middle East including extensive stays in the libraries of the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref> at Mt. Sinai, and the Library of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>. On one trip (1888–89), while on leave from Haverford College, he collected, imported, and then donated to that college several dozen manuscripts. Over the years he traveled, collected, and donated or sold many more manuscripts to the John Rylands Library as well as to Harvard and Birmingham (Mingana collection). Harris is probably most noted, among Syriac scholars, for his publication of the Syriac <ref type="cr">Odes of Solomon</ref>, which he discovered among some mss. from Mesopotamia (and subsequently republished, with a more extensive commentary and new translation, in collaboration with <ref type="cr">A. Mingana</ref>). Among his other important work for Syriac studies was the collaborative work he conducted at St. Catherine’s Monastery on the Sinaitic Syriac palimpsest, which the independent scholarly sisters, Agnes S. Lewis and Margaret D. Gibson (see 
<ref type="cr">Smith, A. and M.</ref>), discovered there. Together with 
R. L. Bensly and <ref type="cr">F. C. Burkitt</ref>, Rendel Harris, Lewis and Gibson, transcribed, collated, annotated, and eventually published this earliest extant Syriac New Testament ms. It was also at St Catherine’s that he discovered the Syriac translation of the Apology of <ref type="cr">Aristides</ref>, lost in Greek</p>

<p>New Testament scholar; professor at General Theological Seminary of New York (1908–17) and at Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, MA (1917–46); Syriac scholar. William Henry Paine Hatch was born in Camden, New Hampshire, in 1875. He studied theology at Harvard University and at Union Theological Seminary in New York. His main interest was in the Greek mss. of the NT, although he occasionally included in his work descriptions and photographs of Syriac mss. In 1922–23, while he was a visiting professor at the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem, he traveled to the monasteries of the Egyptian Wadi al-Natrun in search of Syriac and Coptic mss., but he was able to obtain only a few Coptic folios from St. Macarius Monastery. After his retirement, in 1946, Hatch moved back to New Hampshire. He died in Randolph, NH in 1972.</p>
<p>Hatch’s major and lasting publication in the field of Syriac studies is his <i>Album of Dated Syriac Manuscripts</i> (1946). It contains 200 facsimiles, each representing a page of a dated Syriac ms., in the following <ref type="cr">scripts</ref>: Esṭrangela, Serṭo, E.-Syr., Melk., and <ref type="cr">Christian Palestinian Aramaic</ref>. For the period up to the year 1000, all known dated mss. (more than 100) were included; for the period from the 11th to the 16th cent. selections were made. In the 60 years of its existence Hatch’s <i>Album</i> has proven to be an invaluable guide whenever scholars need to estimate the date of undated mss. Along with the facsimiles and Hatch’s meticulous descriptions, the <i>Album</i>’s introductory chapters, which summarize the state of the art in various subfields of the study of Syriac mss., have created a foundation and a framework of reference for all subsequent scholarly work in Syriac paleography and ms. studies.</p>

The first among the 39 canons addresses the problem of the ‘Messalians’; with their actions against deceitful monks, the bps. may have tried to stop the missionary work undertaken in these years by the Miaphysites (see <ref type="cr">Aḥudemmeh of Balad</ref>). Most of the other canons are of a disciplinary and a general cultural nature, such as no. 37, barring Christian girls from studying secular music.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Ḥenana</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. ca. 610) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>School director and exegete. Ḥenana came from the province of <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref> to study at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> during the time of <ref type="cr">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref> (d. 569). After serving as a teacher in the School, Ḥenana became its director ca. 571. The School flourished under his leadership, for a time. He had a following of some 800 students and updated the School’s statutes (590). However, the School experienced decline near the end of Ḥenana’s tenure as director, marked by a dramatic exodus of students and teachers from the School. The problems were apparently triggered by the theological and political controversies surrounding Ḥenana. Reputed to be a follower of Origen and a Chalcedonian sympathizer who had abandoned the orthodox theological tradition of such teachers as <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, he was the subject of veiled attacks in synods held between 585 and 612 (see <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>, ed. Chabot, 393, 400, 457–61), and was openly denounced by <ref type="cr">Babai the Great</ref>. His controversial leadership of the School also created tensions between the E.-Syr. church hierarchy and the Persian government. The oft-repeated assertions that Ḥenana was responsible for introducing spiritual (‘allegorical’) exegesis into the E.-Syr. tradition and for bringing <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref> into prominence in the Ch. of E. are ill-founded. Though the influence of Chrysostom on E.-Syr. exegesis in the 6th cent. is undeniable, no clear evidence of Ḥenana’s reliance on Chrysostom exists, and Ḥenana is merely one of a number of E.-Syr. practitioners of spiritual exegesis during the 6th–7th cent. The only extant works are two tracts explaining liturgical feasts, On Golden Friday and On the Rogation. <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad</ref> is our main source for extracts from Ḥenana’s exegetical works. Yet by his literary work and in his leadership of the School he significantly influenced E.-Syr. exegesis, theological discourse, and liturgy.</p>
<p><ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>credits Ḥenana with having written a number of commentaries on scripture, homilies, expositions of and expansions to the liturgy, and theological tracts, but his works were banned and mainly lost. Though Ḥenana was undoubtedly a controversial figure, the controversy surrounding him during and after his life time owed much to the impact of larger trends in the Ch. of E. Shifting intellectual, theological, and spiritual movements, along with changing political circumstances, provide the backdrop against which his reputation must be seen.</p>

<p>Cath. since 685/6; author of a law book and of exegetical homilies. In the 7th year of his tenure (692/3) Ḥenanishoʿ was deposed by Yoḥannan bp. of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, who had the support of Caliph ʿAbd al-Malik. Only partly recovered from ill-treatment (whence he was called <i>ḥgirā</i> ‘the lame’), he withdrew to the Monastery of Yawnan (Jonah) near <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, where he died from the plague and was buried. Yoḥannan ruled as counter-patriarch for only a brief period (less than two years), but Ḥenanishoʿ was not able to fully resume his position, and the patriarchal throne remained vacant for several years.</p>
<p>A law book under Ḥenanishoʿ’s name is preserved in ms. Alqosh Syr. 169, the primary source for the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. Organized in 25 chapters and entitled ‘Juridical decisions’ (<i>dine</i>), the collection deals mainly with matrimonial and hereditary law, and reflects for the most part (in particular in ch. 1 to 17) the work of the patriarchal tribunal (ed. Sachau; see also Dauvillier). Some letters of the Cath. have been incorporated in the collection as well.</p>
<p>A very different work by Ḥenanishoʿ, probably a collection of prose homilies on the Gospels, which may go back to his activities as biblical interpreter prior to his election as Cath., has not been preserved in direct transmission. Reinink, however, has been able to identify several extracts from it in the following sources: 
1. ms. Vat. Syr. 504 (a 19th-cent. copy of the 16th-cent. ms. Diyarbakır 113), ff. 63v–65v (21 extracts); 2. NT Commentary of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> (2 extracts); 3. <ref type="cr">Gannat Bussāme</ref> (24 extracts); and 4. the prose Commentary of <ref type="cr">Isḥaq Qardaḥe Shbadnaya</ref><LemmaTitle> (6 extracts).</LemmaTitle>On the basis of these extracts, which occasionally overlap, Reinink could sketch the general profile of the work as a witness to E.-Syr. NT exegesis in the late 7th cent., and compare Ḥenanishoʿ’s exegesis with that of his younger contemporary <ref type="cr">Aba II of Kashkar</ref> (d. 751).</p>
<p>The several other works that are attributed to Ḥenanishoʿ by either ʿAmr b. Mattā or <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> give some impression of his multifaceted interests and abilities. They include, among other things: a biography of his contemporary Sargis Dwadha (<i>sic</i> Wright), who lived near Kashkar; a treatise ‘On the twofold use of the school’; a commentary on the Analytics of <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>; and a ‘Book on the causes of that which exists’. Only from the latter work do a few fragments survive (see Reinink, 74). The other works have left no traces.</p>

<p>Bp. of Lashom and subsequently Cath. Our main source for the life and work of Ḥenanishoʿ is the report of the synod that he convened in 775/6, which is included, as the last synod, in the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. From this report it appears that after the death of Cath. Yaʿqob  II (772/3), Isḥaq bp. of Kashkar, who was supported by Caliph al-Mahdī, had been designated to become the next Cath., a procedure that was rejected by several other bishops who proposed instead Ḥenanishoʿ, until then bp. of Lashom. Ḥenanishoʿ was subsequently consecrated without the knowledge and approval of the bp. of Kashkar, even though the latter, since the first synod of the Ch. of E. (410), was regarded as the right hand of the Cath. and played a crucial role in the process of election and consecration of a new Cath. It was only after Isḥaq’s death, shortly after, that reconciliation could be brought about between the opposing parties and that Ḥenanishoʿ’s situation could be regularized. According to the preserved report, the synod of 775/6 entirely focused on the conflict, validating Ḥenanishoʿ’s election and reaffirming the traditional rights of the see of Kashkar. Henceforth Ḥenanishoʿ was able to serve as Cath., but only 4 years later he was killed through poisoning. No other events of Ḥenanishoʿ’s life are known, nor have any of his writings, among which <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>mentions letters and <i>memre</i>, been preserved. Ḥenanishoʿ’s name is mentioned on the Chinese-Syriac monument of <ref type="cr">Xi’an</ref> (Sian-fu), even though the monument is dated to February 781, which is several months after his death.</p>

Syr. 150, f. 107r–175r (the identification of the author as Ḥenanishoʿ in the margin of f. 107r is probably from Assemani’s hand). While Van den Eynde suggested that we might be dealing in ms. Vat. Syr. 150 with extracts from Ḥenanishoʿ’s work, Reinink found evidence that the ‘Questions on the Economy’ belong to a much later period (12th cent. or later), whereby the possibility of Ḥenanishoʿ’s authorship would be completely ruled out. Ḥenanishoʿ’s exegetical work must, therefore, be considered lost.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Hiba</head><ab type="infobox"/> Ibas (d. 457) 
<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. Hiba must have been active in the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref> from the second or third decade of the 5th cent. Both the E.- and W.-Syr. traditions see him as one of the driving forces behind the translation of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>’s works from Greek into Syriac, which was carried out at the School and may have begun during Theodore’s lifetime (d. 428).</p>
<p>Around the time of the Nestorian controversy (428–31), Hiba parted ways with bp. <ref type="cr">Rabbula of Edessa</ref>. The latter became a staunch defender of <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, the main authority for the Syr. Miaphysites, while Hiba represented the Antiochene dyophysite tradition. In 433 Hiba wrote a famous letter to a certain Mari, ‘the Persian’, in which he bitterly complained about Rabbula’s actions against the writings of Theodore, who increasingly was seen as the teacher of <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>. In the mid–430s Edessa must have been evenly divided between Miaphysites (followers of Cyril) and Dyophysites (standing in Theodore’s tradition), for after Rabbula’s death (436), Hiba was elected as the latter’s successor. Even though the campaign against Theodore continued in Constantinople, Syria, and Armenia, the situation in Edessa under Hiba’s tenure was relatively quiet. As bp., Hiba is credited with building activities. In 448, however, Hiba became one of the main targets of the strict Miaphysites, who in the synod of Ephesus in 449 (later known as the ‘Robber Synod’) succeeded in deposing him, mainly on the grounds of making too strict a distinction between the divinity and humanity in Christ. Two years later, Hiba’s letter to Mari was officially read at the Council of Chalcedon (451), and Hiba was rehabilitated as bp. of Edessa, a position he was able to hold until his death.</p>
<p>Nearly a century after his death, Hiba’s name returned to the center of the Christological discussions. In an attempt to win Miaphysite acceptance of the Council of Chalcedon, the emperor Justinian in an edict of 543/4 condemned Hiba’s letter to Mari. Since the letter was seen as sympathetic to Theodore and Nestorius, it was considered a stumbling block for the anti-Chalcedonians. Justinian’s condemnation of Hiba’s Letter, as one of the ‘Three Chapters’, subsequently was taken over and affirmed by the Council of Constantinople (553). This did not, however, lead to the reconciliation between Chalcedonians and Miaphysites.</p>
<p>Except for Hiba’s letter to Mari, which exists in Greek (in all likelihood translated from the Syriac original), no other works by Hiba have been preserved.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Ḥimṣ</head><ab type="infobox"/>Ḥomṣ, Emesa
<p>City in Syria. Ḥimṣ, known in Syriac as <i>Ḥemṣ</i>, <i>Ḥ</i><i>meṣ</i>, and <i>Puniqi</i>, and located on a fertile plain just east of the Orontes (ʿĀṣī) river, was in the 1st cent. BC the seat of a local Arab principality, which became a vassal of Rome in 64 BC. Ḥimṣ rose to political prominence in the 3rd cent. when Julia Domna, a daughter of the Emesan princely-priestly family, married Emperor Septimius Severus (193–211) and two sons of the same family, Elagabalus (218–22) and Alexander Severus (222–35), ascended the imperial throne. Ḥimṣ fell to the Arabs in 637. In the latter part of the 10th cent., Ḥimṣ was occupied on several occasions by the Byzantines. Ḥimṣ was attacked, but not taken, by the Crusaders in 1098 and 1126. Under Ottoman rule (1516–1918), Ḥimṣ was the administrative center of a district within the province of <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>. Ḥimṣ is today a provincial capital with a population of just under 1 million, making it the third largest city in Syria after <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> and Damascus.</p>
<p>Ḥimṣ, the birthplace of Pope Anicetus (ca. 154–66), was no doubt evangelised at an early date. The Passion of the local martyr Julian (Elian) has two of its inhabitants healed by Jesus and has the apostles Peter and John pass through Ḥimṣ on their way to <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, while the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> has Malyo, one of the seventy, preach the Gospel in Ḥimṣ. Historically more certain is bp. Silvanus, who was martyred under Diocletian. Among his successors in the 4th cent. were <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Emesa</ref> and Nemesius, the author of the treatise ‘On the nature of man’. Ḥimṣ, originally suffragan to Damascus, became a metropolitan see after the head of St. John the Baptist was discovered in the nearby Monastery of Spelaeon in 452. <ref type="cr">Romanos the Melodist</ref> was a native of Ḥimṣ. Bp. Julian of Ḥimṣ was among the Miaphysite bishops banished with <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> in 519. A noteworthy Syr. Orth. scholar from Ḥimṣ is ʿAbd al-Masīḥ b. Nāʿima al-Ḥimṣī (fl. ca. 830), who translated the so-called ‘Theology of Aristotle’ into Arabic. In later times, together with<ref type="cr"> Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>some 70 km. to the south, the area around Ḥimṣ remained a center of Syr. Orth. activities, which gained in importance especially around the time of <ref type="cr">Dawid Puniqoyo</ref> (i.e. Dawid of Ḥimṣ) and <ref type="cr">Nuḥ the Lebanese</ref> (Patr. 1493–1509), who was bp. of Ḥimṣ in 1480–90 and who spent the latter part of his patriarchate (1493–1509) in the area of Ḥimṣ and Ḥama, consecrating the myron once in the Monastery of al-Zunnār in Ḥimṣ and once in the Church of the Forty Martyrs there. Ḥimṣ became the seat of the Syr. Orth. patriarchate again when Severos <ref type="cr">Afram Barsoum</ref>, metr. of Syria and resident in Ḥimṣ, was elected Patr. in 1933 and remained so until 1959 when the patriarchate was transferred to Damascus.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th cent., Ḥimṣ is reported to have had a population of around 50,000, including 33,000 Muslims, 14,500 Melk. Orth., 1,000 Syr. Orth., 500 Melk. Catholics, and 350 Maron. Ḥimṣ is today the seat of four bishoprics: Syr. Orth. (united with Ḥama, with ca. 50,000 faithful), Syr. Catholic (united with Ḥama and Nabk, ca. 10,000), Melk. Orth. and Melk. Catholic (united with Ḥama and Yabrud). The Syr. Orth. cathedral of St. Mary (Umm al-Zunnār) in the eastern part of the old city houses the girdle (<i>zunoro</i>) of Our Lady which was rediscovered under the altar of the church by Patr. Ignatius Aphram Barsoum in 1953.</p>
<p>In the environs of Ḥimṣ are two other old centers of W.-Syr. Christianity: Ṣadad (ca. 50 km. south-southeast of Ḥimṣ), whose bishops are attested sporadically from the 11th cent. onwards and which was the birthplace of Syr. Orth. Patr. Ignatius <ref type="cr">ʿAbdullāh Saṭṭūf</ref> (1906–15); and Qaryatayn (75 km. southeast), with the Monastery of St. Julian/Mar Elian (now Syr. Cath.) just to the west of the village. Several other villages in the area also have (or had) Syr. populations: Zaydal (5 km. east of center of Ḥimṣ), Fayrūza (5 km. southeast), Maskana (7 km. south; birthplace of Syr. Catholic Patr. Ignatius Mūsā Dā<cTypeface:Italic>ʾūd, Patr. 1998–2001), al-Fuḥīla (20 km. southeast), Furqlus (35 km. east-southeast) and al-Ḥafar (7  km. south of Ṣadad).</p>

<p>Ḥimyar is the name of a geographical area in southwest Arabia as well as that of a tribal confederation in power from the 1st cent. BC to ca. AD 525. At times the Ḥimyarites ruled over large parts of S. Arabia, well into the Arabian desert. Their capital was Ẓafār, near present-day Yarīm (in Yemen). Inscriptions in Sabaic, an Old South Arabian language, were produced until the 6th cent. AD. Living from trade, the Ḥimyarites had to assert their power vis-à-vis the Ethiopians in the Horn of Africa, and vis-à-vis the Romans in the north. In the 4th cent. they came into contact with both Christianity and Judaism.</p>
<p>The Ḥimyarites are occasionally mentioned in Syriac literature. In the Life of Bishop Paul of Qentos and Priest John of Edessa (which details events from the first half of the 5th cent.) it is reported that Paul and John, on their way from <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> to Mount Sinai, are captured by pagan, tree-worshipping Arabs and brought to a place named ‘of the Ḥimyarites’. The Ḥimyarites occupy a more prominent place in the literature concerning the war that broke out in the 2nd decade of the 6th cent. and culminated in the persecution and killing of Christians by the king of the Ḥimyarites in the city of <ref type="cr">Nagran</ref>. The date of the persecution is debated, either 518 or 523. The existence of a letter written by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> to the persecuted Nagranites would point to the former date, while the majority of the other sources explicitly refer to the latter. The sources present the king of Ḥimyar, variously known as Yūsuf, Masrūq, or Dhū-Nuwās, as being Jewish, which adds to the dramatic power of the narratives. The persecution in Nagran was the prelude to a major intervention by the joint forces of the Roman emperor Justin I and the Ethiopian negus, which ended Ḥimyarite supremacy on the Arabian Peninsula and established an Ethiopian protectorate, which also had close contacts with the Byzantine Empire. The Persians conquered S. Arabia in 572, and this region came under Muslim rule in 628.</p>
<p>One of the main sources providing information on the persecution and the martyrdom of Christians in Nagran is the Syriac ‘Book of the Ḥimyarites’ (<i>Ktābā da-ḥmirāye</i>), which is only fragmentarily known in a 
10th-cent. ms. (ed. A. Moberg). The Book is anonymous, but I. Shahîd argued that its author was <ref type="cr">Shemʿun of Beth Arsham</ref>, a well-known anti-Chalcedonian leader, who authored one and possibly two Syriac letters concerning the persecution. Not only the Book’s authorship, but also its relationship to the other sources is debated. The persecuted Christians of Nagran are portrayed in the Syriac sources as being of non-Chalcedonian allegiance. The Greek version of the ‘Martyrdom of Arethas’ (Ḥārith), however, a text that does not exist in Syriac, is written from a Chalcedonian viewpoint. The Greek texts concerning Gregentius bp. of Ẓafār, who lived in the 
6th cent., reflect a Chalcedonian milieu as well.</p>

<p>Author writing in Greek of problematic identity. His Chronicle (CPG 1896), which included the ‘Division of the earth’ (<i>Diamerismos</i>) based on Gen. 10, was a source used by several Syriac chroniclers (see <ref type="cr">Historiography, Syriac</ref>) and may once have existed in Syriac translation, though it could also have reached them through intermediary channels. A  Syriac translation of the beginning of his Commentary on Daniel (<i>CPG</i> 1873), on Susanna, is preserved at the end of <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>’s Commentary on Daniel. Dionysios’s Commentary on the Apocalypse also has quotations from Hippolytus’s work on Antichrist (<i>CPG</i> 1872) and against Caius (<i>CPG</i> 1891); two excerpts with the Syriac translation of the former (with ch. 7–14, 60–1) are transmitted independently, while fragments of the Syriac translation of the latter are preserved in Sinai (New Finds) Syr. M53N and Fragment 23, of the 6th cent. There are also Syriac translations of two works wrongly attributed to Hippolytus, a Homily on Epiphany (<i>CPG</i> 1917), and a commentary on Exodus 16 (<i>CPG</i> 1924, not known in Greek). Excerpts from some further works by Hippolytus (<i>CPG</i> 1871, 1882, 1886, 1900) have been collected by J. P. P.

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Ḥirta</head><ab type="infobox"/>al-Ḥīra
<p>Ancient city near the Euphrates to the southeast of present-day al-Najaf. Ḥirta was the capital of the pre-Islamic Arab kingdom of the Lakhmids, who were usually allied with the Sasanians and constantly at war with the Ghassānids, allies of Byzantium, to the west. It was an important center of pre-Islamic Arab culture, where many of its poets gathered and where the Arabic script is said to have originated. The name ‘Ḥirtā’ is indicative of its origin as a nomadic encampment, and in Syriac sources it is sometimes called ‘Ḥirtā d-Nuʿmān’ to distinguish it from other such settlements. ʿAmr b. ʿAdī (ca. 270–300) is said to have been the first Lakhmid to make Ḥirta his capital. By the 5th cent., the population under Lakhmid rule had a large Christian component, called the ʿIbād, which is understood to mean ‘servants’ or ‘devotees’ of the Lord. The Syriac Life of <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref> tells us that Nuʿmān I (405–18) revoked the prohibition on his subjects travelling into Roman territory on pilgrimage to Shemʿun’s pillar after a visit from the stylite in a dream. Nuʿmān II (500–3), though not a baptised Christian, is said to have regularly attended church services. Mundhir III (506–54), who had a Christian mother (Māʾ al-Samāʾ) and a Christian wife (Hind, daughter of Arethas/Ḥārith b. ʿAmr al-Kindī), may have become Christian himself for a brief period before reverting to paganism. The only Lakhmid king to become openly Christian and persist in his faith was Nuʿmān III (583 – ca. 602), the last of the dynasty, who was deposed and killed by the Sasanian king Khusrau II (590–628). Ḥirta was taken by the Muslim army under Khālid b. al-Walīd in 633. Ḥirta began to decline when the new garrison town of al-Kūfa was founded near ʿĀqolā a few kilometers north of Ḥirta by Saʿd b. Abī Waqqāṣ in 638, to become the administrative center of al-ʿIrāq under Arab occupation and, for a time under the first Abbasids (750–63), the seat of the caliphate.</p>
<p>The first known bp. of Ḥirta is Hoshaʿ, who attended the synod of the Ch. of E. in 410. The Ch. of E. Catholicoi frequently resided in Ḥirta, especially at times of persecution in areas under direct Sasanian rule, and at least five of them found their resting places in Ḥirta (<ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ I</ref> [421–56], Babowai [457–84], <ref type="cr">Aba  I</ref> [540–52], Ḥazqiel [567–81], and <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb I</ref> [582–95]; perhaps also <ref type="cr">Aqaq</ref> [485–95/6] and, later, Abraham II [837–50]). There was a school at Ḥirta founded by <ref type="cr">Qiyore of Edessa</ref>, a disciple of Aba I, and housed in a monastery later called Dayr al-Askūl. Among the later bishops of Ḥirta was the lexicographer <ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ b. Seroshway</ref> (9th cent.). The famous translator <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> al-ʿIbādī (d. 873) was a native of Ḥirta. The last known bp. of Ḥirta is Yūḥannā b. Nāzūk, who became Cath. in 1012.</p>
<p>We hear of two attempts made to win the Lakhmids to Miaphysitism at the beginning of the 6th cent., through a letter purportedly sent by <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> to Abū Yaʿfur (503–5) and through emissaries sent by <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> to Mundhir III in 513. A little later the Miaphysite missionary-bishop <ref type="cr">Shemʿun of Beth Arsham</ref> was active in the area and reported from here about the events in <ref type="cr">Nagran</ref> in 524. A group of Miaphysites fleeing persecution by Emperor Justin I (518–27) took refuge in Ḥirta, but were expelled at the insistence of Cath. Shila (503–23) and resettled in the ‘Land of Payram’, around ʿAyn al-Tamr, to the northwest of Ḥirta. Some time before 549, the partisans of <ref type="cr">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref> also sent a bp. called Sergios to Ḥirta, who gained a following in the ‘Land of Payram’, which was settled by migrants from South Arabian Nagran. This Julianist community in Iraqi Nagran survived until the end of the 8th cent., when we hear of their final surrender to the Ch. of E. in two letters of <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>. W.-Syr. presence near Ḥirta is indicated in the 7th cent. by a reference to <ref type="cr">Marutha of Tagrit</ref> staying in the cell of Rabban Shabur at ʿĀqolā/ʿOqulo just before 624, and in the 8th cent. by the mention of bp. Bacchus of ʿOqulo, who became metr. of <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref> ca. 706, as well as by <ref type="cr">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref> styling himself as the bp. of the ‘Tanukhoye, Tuʿoye, and ʿOquloye’ in his letter to the priest Yeshuʿ of ʿAna.</p>
<p>The Lakhmid kings normally resided in palaces outside of Ḥirta, such as the famous palace of al-Khawarnaq to the east of Ḥirta. The township of Ḥirta itself was made up of a series of fortified dwellings, each of them normally associated with a certain clan. Some, at least, of the churches were also associated with specific clans, such as those of the Banū Māzin and Banū ʿAdī. Two churches, unfortunately without indication of their names, were discovered in excavations carried out at Ḥirta by an Oxford expedition led by D. Talbot Rice in 1931. The large number of monasteries that dotted the countryside around Ḥirta were described in the <i>Kutub al-diyārāt</i>, a special genre of Arabic literature dealing with monasteries, such as Shābushtī’s (d. ca. 988) ‘Book of monasteries’ (<i>Kitāb al-diyārāt</i>) and Hishām b. Muḥammad al-Kalbī’s (d. ca. 819) ‘Book of Ḥīra’ (<i>Kit</i><i>āb al-Ḥīra</i>), which is now lost but was used, among others, by the geographer Yāqūt in his <i>Muʿjam al-buldān</i>. In these works, many of the monasteries around Ḥirta are associated with and named after (often female) members of the Lakhmid royal family, including al-Lajj, a daughter of Nuʿmān II, ʿAlqama, the father of Abū Yaʿfur (503–5), Ḥanẓala, a nephew of the same, Hind the Elder, the wife of Mundhir III, and Hind the Younger, a daughter of Nuʿmān III.</p>

<Author>H. Takahashi</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Historiography, Syriac 
</LemmaTitle><p>The beginnings of writing history in Syriac remain unknown, but one may connect it to the existence of notes on various events that were kept in the royal archives of Osrhoene (although there must have been similar archives in other <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref>-speaking countries, e.g. in <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref>, we have no information about them). The notes per se are not historiography, but they could be used to construct a narrative of some kind about the past. After the end of the kingdom of Osrhoene, the materials from the royal archives, at least partly, found their way to the episcopal archives. This can be inferred from the first W.-Syr. local chronicle that we know, the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, written soon after 532 in which local material from both the pre-Christian epoch (such as the chronologically first note: ‘The year 180 [of the Seleucid era  = 132/1 BC]: kings began to reign in Edessa.’) and Christian epoch was included.</p>
<label type="subsection">Chronicle Writing</label>
<p>The Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> opens the series of local chronicles (which occasionally also have notes on non-local events, e.g. on the birth of Jesus or the accession of Roman emperors). A comparison of this Chronicle with other chronicles of similar character has revealed that it is an excerpt from a more extensive, not extant, work conventionally called the Original Chronicle of Edessa. Some of the notes (lemmata) of the latter that are not present in the extant Chronicle of Edessa can be found in other Syriac chronicles, e.g. the Chronicle to the year 819. In its first part it seems to have followed quite closely the Original Chronicle of Edessa, but in the second part it notes other events: a series of lemmata recount events connected with the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref>, from which it may be inferred that its author was a monk of that monastery.</p>
<p>What the local chronicles also have in common is their annalistic structure, which means that they present historical events in short pieces of information, called lemmata. These begin with a year date and state what happened that year. A typical such lemma is for instance ‘The year 672: Walgash, bishop of Nisibis, died...’.</p>
<p>There were certainly other chronicles of this type, which however have not survived. We have several fragments of such works, sometimes only a few folios long, but still valuable for the historical information they provide, as for instance one very mutilated folio that brings information on the Arab conquest of Syria in the beginning of the 7th cent., or a fragment of a Chronicle up to the year 813 (<i>Chronica minora</i>, II & III).</p>
<p>In addition to historical information of local character soon another type of historiographic literature developed, the so-called universal (or world) chronicles. This genre was implanted in Syriac by translation of two chronicles written in Greek, those of <ref type="cr">Hippolytus of Rome</ref> and <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref>.</p>
<p>The first of them seems to have been intended not as a continuous exposition of the events of world history, but rather as a gazetteer providing geographical, ethnographical, and linguistic information on the then known world, in addition to data on the early history of mankind, culled from the Bible. The Chronicle of Hippolytus of Rome (d. 235), or rather its material (as it had a complicated transmission history) is also known as the Division of the earth (<i>Diamerismos tē</i><i>s gēs</i>), i.e. between the sons of Noah, since geographical lists (of countries, mountains, rivers, islands), ethnographical (of various peoples), linguistic (of languages including those that have written literature), and historical were all expressed within the account of the vicissitudes of the three sons of Noah and their progeny. They were believed to have divided the world into their respective possessions. In Syriac several versions of Hippolytos’s material are known, sometimes only fragmentarily preserved, either as separate texts (Peoples after the confusion of languages in Babylon, On the families of languages), or  — more often — incorporated into larger works, be it chronicles (the Chronicle to the year 724, the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, and that of <ref type="cr">Bar ʾEbroyo</ref> [see below]), or other texts, such as biblical commentaries (Scholion of <ref type="cr">Theodoros Bar Koni</ref>, the Commentary of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, and two other anonymous commentaries, all from the period of the 8th to 10th cent.), and accounts of sacred history (<ref type="cr">Shlemon of Baṣra</ref>’s ‘Book of the Bee’, 13th cent.) (Witakowski 1996).</p>
<p>The Chronicle of Eusebius of Caesarea (d. 339) had a very specific form, called canons: it was written in the form of tables with parallel columns in which the years of the rulers of all nations or states known to him were enumerated (the so-called <i>fila regnorum</i>), whereas on both sides of these columns, the so-called <i>spatium historicum</i>, notes on various events were placed (Witakowski 1999–2000). The Chronicle was translated into Syriac in the 6th cent. It has not been preserved, but it was used by many later Syr. chroniclers, thanks to whom we know relatively well how it was structured and what it contained. The work of Eusebius was expanded by later Greek chroniclers (Annianos [5th cent.] and Andronikos [6th cent.]), who added material from the creation of the world (­Eusebius started his canons from Abraham) and continued its narrative up to their time. These chronicles were translated into Syriac too, but none of them is extant.</p>
<p>The earliest Syr. chronicle which used Eusebius’s work as its source is the so-called Maronite Chronicle, written after 664. Its author supplemented the Eusebian material with material from other sources and notes on the history of the Maronites. He continued it until his own epoch, adding notes on the history of the Arabs. The Maronite Chronicle does not have the column form.</p>
<p>Even earlier than the work just named is the Melkite Chronicle, composed after 638, which, however, did not use the Chronicle of Eusebius. It brings Old Testament chronology, and for the Christian period, lists of patriarchs of the main sees, becoming more informative only from the epoch of <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>. Its Melkite origin is clear from the presence of anti-Miaphysite anathemas (ed. de Halleux).</p>
<p>The Eusebian model is on the other hand clearly seen in the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (d. 708). This work, only fragmentarily preserved, has the column format of Eusebius. Yaʿqub did not copy Eusebius’s work, only continued it. He provided material on the history of the Church, of the Byzantine empire, and of Persia, a country which Eusebius totally neglected, but which the Syr. historians for obvious reasons could not (Witakowski 2008).</p>
<label type="subsection">Ecclesiastical History Writing</label>
<p>Eusebius’s influence in Syr. historiography is seen not only in chronography, but also in another genre of history writing, namely ecclesiastical (or church) history (Syr. <i>eqlisiyasṭiqi</i>). Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History was very soon, in any case before the middle of the 5th cent., translated into Syriac (Van Rompay 1994), and contrary to the Chronicle it has been preserved, though with lacunae. It was used by later Syr. historians, whereby the genre of ecclesiastical history was implanted in Syriac historiography.</p>
<p>Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History found continuators in Greek too, and the work of at least one of them, Socrates Scholasticus (d. ca. 450), was translated into Syriac, and has been preserved both in excerpts and in an abbreviated form (not published). Whether works of other continuators of Eusebius, Sozomen, and <ref type="cr">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref> were also translated into Syriac, but have not been preserved, is not certain. On the other hand, at least two fragments of the latter’s ‘Religious History’ were translated into Syriac: the lives of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> and <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>. What is extant in Syriac is a translation of another Ecclesiastical History, namely that of <ref type="cr">Zacharias Rhetor</ref>, bp. of Mitylene (d. after 536), which is even more valuable as the Greek original is lost. Zacharias was a Miaphysite, which is why copying his works in Greek was discontinued, whereas they have survived in Syriac translations. The Syriac version of his Ecclesiastical History was incorporated into a larger compilation supplied with hagiographical and other material and continued until the year 569, by an anonymous historian who for lack of a better name is referred to as <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>.</p>
<p>A church historian a few years younger than Zacharias was <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> (d. 588), a monk from Northern Mesopotamia, who spent most of his life in Constantinople. Only the last, the third, part of his Ecclesiastical History has survived in a separate ms. tradition. We owe to Yuḥanon also another work, the ‘Lives of the Eastern Saints’, which is a collection of lives of Syr. ascetics, most of whom Yuḥanon knew personally.</p>
<p>As far as the state of preservation is concerned the Ecclesiastical History of Patr. <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> (818–845) fared even worse. Fortunately it was used by later Syriac historians, especially by Michael Rabo and the author of the Chronicle to the year 1234.</p>
<label type="subsection">Later W.-Syr. Historiography</label>
<p>A work once erroneously attributed to Patr. Dionysios is a universal Chronicle whose anonymous author was a monk in the monastery of Zuqnin near <ref type="cr">Amid</ref> (8th  cent.). The Chronicle, composed in 775, was previously called the Chronicle of Pseudo-Dionysios, but is now mostly referred to as the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>. Although the author used Eusebian material, his work, especially in later parts, does not present information in short lemmata, but has extensive excerpts from other kinds of sources. In fact it is the largest Syr. historiographical work written until the 8th cent., introducing a new genre: developed chronicle. The annalistic structure is kept (though there are no canons) but the author often inserted material from his sources in large extracts or in their entirety. His main sources are the Bible, the Chronicle of Eusebius, the Ecclesiastical History of Socrates, and that of Yuḥanon of Ephesus, while the last part contains his own material. He used many other sources, including works which have been subsequently lost (Witakowski 1987). One of such works, most probably copied by him in its entirety, is the Chronicle of Pseudo-<ref type="cr">Yeshuʿ the Stylite</ref>, a history of the Persian-Byzantine war of the beginning of the 6th cent., written practically as an eye-witness account.</p>
<p>With this first developed chronicle in Syriac, the genre difference between chronicle and ecclesiastical history was abolished.</p>
<p>It does not mean however that short chronicles were no longer composed. The material published under the title of the Chronicle to the year 724 (anonymous, but see Palmer 1992) is actually not a chronicle in the meaning of a planned and elaborate historiographic work, but a collection of series of lemmata culled from various sources, including the Chronicle of Hippolytus, the Chronicle of Eusebius, together with its Antiochene Continuation (Burgess 1999), an account of Church councils, and a list of Umayyad caliphs, put down one after another without the chronological order. In fact for many lemmata dates are missing.</p>
<p>The Chronicle to the year 846 is again a short lemma chronicle. Although the preserved text starts from the birth of Levi, the son of the Old Testament patriarch Jacob (there are many lacunae further on in the text too), there can be no doubt that it was a universal chronicle. It includes material taken from several sources, such as the Chronicle of Eusebius for universal history, and  — for local data — the Original Chronicle of Edessa, the Chronicle to the year 819, the <ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref>, the Ecclesiastical Histories of Yuḥanon of Ephesus and Zacharias of Mitylene, lists of bishops of various sees, and accounts of church councils.</p>
<p>Later chronicles, written during the period of the so-called <ref type="cr">Syriac Renaissance</ref>, are all of the developed type. These are the Chronicle of Michael Rabo (d. 1199), the anonymous <ref type="cr">Chronicle of 1234</ref>, and the Chronicle of Bar ʿEbroyo (d. 1286). From the indications of the sources that the authors of these works have made (e.g. the Chronicles by Basil of Edessa, <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>, etc.) we know that there was much more historiographical literature composed before the epoch of Michael Rabo, but none of them is extant. (For the latter Chronicle, see the entry on Michael Rabo.)</p>
<p>The author of the anonymous Chronicle of 1234, was probably a monk of the <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref>, and seems to have had some more or less official auxiliary ecclesiastical duties. He was a native of Edessa, which can be seen in his detailed notes on the events of the history of that city. Most of them, it is true, were taken from the lost Edessene chronicle of Basil Bar Shumana, the metropolitan of Edessa, but they continue even after the date of the latter’s death (1171). The Chronicle was begun as a simple work of universal history, but after the epoch of Constantine the abundance of material to be dealt with caused the author to divide it into two parts, ecclesiastical and secular. The Edessene author used many of the sources that Michael Rabo did, but independently from him: he did not know Michael’s work.</p>
<p>Dividing historiographical works into two parts became a solution also with Bar ʿEbroyo. With his Chronicle the classical period of W.-Syr. historiography ends. (For further information on his work, see the entry on this author.)</p>
<label type="subsection">E.-Syr. Historiography</label>
<p>The output of the E.-Syr. historians seems smaller today than that of their W.-Syr. colleagues, but this impression is due to the fact that even fewer E.-Syr. historiographic works have been preserved than was the case with the W.-Syr. We do know, however, from<ref type="cr"> Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (see below) and from <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ Bar Brikha</ref>, the author of the so-called ‘Catalogue’ (13th cent.), that there were once many more historiographic works than are extant today in the known collections of mss.</p>
<p>One such work of which ʿAbdishoʿ informs us was an Ecclesiastical History composed by one Mshiḥa Zkha. When a ms. containing an account of early Christian history in Adiabene was discovered and published in 1907, it seemed to its finder and editor (A. Mingana) that it was Mshiḥa Zkha’s work. This identification may not be correct, and in fact today it is referred to as an anonymous Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>. It is a collection of bio­graphies of 20 bps. of this see, from the early 2nd cent. up to the middle of the 6th cent., when it was probably composed. The authenticity of the Chronicle of Arbela was questioned (because of forgery of the only known ms. of the Chronicle; Fiey 1967), but the opinion of most scholars today is rather in favor of the authenticity of at least large parts of the material of the Chronicle (Kawerau 1985).</p>
<p>The Ecclesiastical History of<ref type="cr"> Barḥadbshabba ʿArbaya</ref> (6th cent.) is the oldest (preserved) E.-Syr. work of this genre. Barḥadbshabba, who was a senior scholar (Syr. <i>bādoqā</i>) of the famous theological <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>, provides a series of accounts of Church Fathers and ‘heretics’, starting from Arius and coming up to <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref> and <ref type="cr">Abraham</ref>, the doctors of the Persian Church (6th  cent.), attached to the School. Much place is naturally devoted to <ref type="cr">Diodore of Tarsus</ref>, <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>, but <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref>, <ref type="cr">Basil of Caesarea</ref>, and other fathers have their place here too. Among the sources of Barḥadbshabba are the Ecclesiastical History of Socrates for the Greek fathers and Nestorius’s Book of Heraclides.</p>
<p>The anonymous History of <ref type="cr">Karka d-Beth Slokh</ref> (6th  cent.), except for a few details regarding the history of the city, is an account of the martyrdom of several inhabitants of that city who were killed during the persecutions of Yazdgard in the middle of the 5th cent.</p>
<p>The Chronicle of Khuzistan, also known as the Chronicle of the last Sasanians (7th cent.), provides information on the history of the Persian Church, and moreover, it contains much valuable data for the history of Persia from the reign of Hormizd IV (579–90) until the Arab conquest. The Chronicle seems to be an excerpt from a larger (not preserved) work on ecclesiastical history, the author of which was, according to some scholars, Eliya metropolitan of Merv.</p>
<p><ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Penkaye</ref>, i.e. from the village Penek in Northern Mesopotamia, wrote soon after 686 the ‘Book of the Main Events’ (<i>Ktābā d-reš melle</i>), which is an epitome of world history, intended as an account of God’s salvation economy. Still it is a valuable source for the last decades it covers (the reign of Caliph Muʿāwiyya and beyond).</p>
<p>The E.-Syr. authors were perhaps more interested in monastic history than the W.-Syr. historians. One work of this type is the ‘Book of the Abbots of the <ref type="cr">Monastery Beth ʿAbe</ref>’, composed ca. 850 by <ref type="cr">Toma bp. of Marga</ref> in Adiabene.</p>
<p>One or two decades later another monastic history, entitled ‘The Book of Chastity’, was composed by <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref> the metropolitan of Baṣra. It contains 140 biographical sketches of E.-Syr. monastics, famous as founders of monasteries or as authors of ascetic writings. The same author is also known to have composed a separate Ecclesiastical History, which has not survived.</p>
<p>The Chronicle of Eliya of Nisibis (d. 1046) is the only E.-Syr. universal chronicle of the Eusebian type. In the first, so-called chronographical, part Eliya, following Eusebius, gathered lists of Old Testament patriarchs, kings, and rulers of various countries, together with an annotated list of the catholicoi of the Ch. of E. The next part, the canons, is written in columns, but Eliya uses them in a different way from Eusebius. From right to left they contain: 1. dates given in the Seleucid era, and, for the Muslim period, in the era of Hijra; 2. the source of the entry (it is here that we learn of many Syr. historiographic works that once existed), which as a regularly recurring piece of information is exceptional in Syr. chronicle writing; and 3. the actual lemmata given in two languages, Syriac and Arabic (an indication that the Arabization of the E. Syrians had already made some progress). Eliya’s sources include Eusebius’s Chronicle, Socrates’s Ecclesiastical History, and W.-Syr. works: the Chronicle of Yuḥanon ‘the Jacobite’, i.e. Yuḥanon of Ephesus, Chronicle of Yaʿqub of Edessa, and a list of the Syr. Orth. patriarchs. This shows exchange between the intellectuals of the two Syr.-speaking churches. Among the E.-Syr. sources he quotes a list of the catholicoi and a chronicle of the metropolitans of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, but also Arabic sources. Altogether he quotes ca. 60 sources of which half are unknown (Pinggéra 2006; Witakowski 2007).</p>
<p>From the last period of the classical epoch of Syr. literature comes the biography of the Cath. <ref type="cr">Yahbalaha</ref>  <ref type="cr">III</ref> (d. 1317), who before his election was a monk in <ref type="cr">China</ref> of Uighur or Turkish origin. The Story of Yabhalaha is a biography of the Cath. but also a travelogue of his journey, together with his companion, <ref type="cr">Rabban Ṣawma</ref>, across Asia, and in its second part Ṣawma’s across Europe. As such it is unique in Syriac literature. It provides an insight into the contacts between geographically remote provinces and the center of the once pan-Asiatic Ch. of E. before its decline in the subsequent epoch.</p>
<p>E.-Syr. authors wrote also historiographic works in Arabic. The change of the language occurred gradually, the first step being taken by Eliya of Nisibis who used both languages in the same work. There is no doubt, however, that works such as the Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref>(10th cent.) or The Book of the Tower (<i>Kitāb al-Majd</i><i>āl</i>; ca. 1350), although written in Arabic, were based on Syriac sources.</p>

<p>The Chaldean monastery of Rabban Hormizd, built upon a mountain ridge northeast of <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref>in northern Iraq, is famous not only for its magnificent location and impressive buildings, but also for its central role in the history of the transmission of E.-Syr. literature and its importance in the struggles between the Chald. Church and the Ch. of E., to which the monastery originally belonged. Similar struggles, between the Syr. Orth. and the Ch. of E., formed the context of the monastery’s early beginnings in the 7th cent., when, according to Rabban Shemʿon, the author of the ‘History of Rabban Hormizd the Persian’, it was founded by Rabban Hormizd of <ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>, a former monk of the Monastery of Rabban <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEdta</ref>. Whereas a few 12th-cent. mss. indicate its importance in earlier centuries, the monastery’s most important achievements date from the late 15th to early 20th cent. Following the turbulent 14th cent., its monks contributed to the revival of E.-Syr. ms. writing in the 15th and first half of the 16th cent. Among the earliest authors of that period is the monk <ref type="cr">Sargis bar Waḥle</ref>(ca. 1500), who wrote a <i>Memronā</i> (a metrical homily) on Rabban Hormizd. In the 17th and early 18th cent., after the number of monks declined considerably, a few clerical families from nearby Alqosh took the lead in ms. production. Among these was the Abuna family, who also provided the patriarchs for one of the patriarchal lines of the Ch. of E. These patriarchs of the Eliya line had their official residence in the monastery, where most of them were also buried, their grave stones spanning the centuries between 1497 and 1804. In Rabban Hormizd, also the first schism with the Chaldean church originated, when in 1552 its abbot <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref> was elected as a counter-patriarch after part of the Ch. of E. disagreed with the choice of a new potential successor (<i>naṭar kursi</i>) from the Abuna family. Despite Sullaqa’s relative success in acquiring papal consecration and establishing a new Catholic line, the monastery remained in the hands of the traditional party and was a seat of opposition to the Catholic hierarchies until the late 18th cent., even though some of the Eliya patriarchs attempted to establish their own connections with Rome. After the monastery was practically deserted in the late 18th cent., a new era started when the Chaldean monk Gabriel Dambo (alternatively written as Danbo) appropriated it as the location of a new monastic community. After initial opposition, his order was recognized in 1830, by which time the patr. of the Eliya line, Yoḥannan Hormizd, had also converted to Catholicism. Gabriel Dambo succeeded in attracting a group of enthusiastic monks, who after some training were sent into the villages of northern Iraq to assist the Dominican missionaries in their work in the countryside. Some of the monks later became bishops, while ms. writing was taken up again as well. One of the more serious problems of the monastery was its isolated location making it vulnerable to pillage and raids by local Kurds and passing armies; documented attacks include Murād Bey’s attack in 1508, Kurdish threats in 1706 and 1717, pillaging by the Persian armies of Nādir Shāh in 1743, and again Kurdish raids in 1842 and 1850. In 1858, therefore, the decision was made to build a new Chaldean monastery, ‘Our Lady of the Seeds’ (‘Notre Dame des Semences’), closer to Alqosh, safer and more comfortable in the cold winter months. It was here that the scribal tradition of Rabban Hormizd was again taken up and carried into the early 20th cent.</p>

<p>He was born to ʿBeid Salmān Ḥubeika in Baskintā in the region of Metn. He attended the school of St. Joseph in Baskintā, and learned Syriac at the school of Sayyidat Baskintā. In 1893 he joined the monastery of Mar Mūsā al-Dawwār in Metn and became a novice. He was sent to study Syriac, Arabic, and French at the school of Dayr Qabriyānos in Kfīfān, and theology at the Lebanese school of Qarnat Shahwān from 1897–98. He was ordained a priest in 1898, and began teaching, especially Syriac, at a number of schools in the region. He performed a number of administrative positions in various schools and monasteries. In addition to his writings in <i>al-Machriq</i> (e.g. on Arabic names of villages derived from Syriac), he composed in Syriac a collection of poems under the title <i>Recueil de poèmes syriaques</i> (n. d., but according to Abūna published by his brother Peter Ḥubeika in 1952).

<Author>G. A. Kiraz</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</LemmaTitle><CharStyle:Lemma info 1 Char> <ab type="infobox"/>(808–873) [Ch. of E.]
<p>Physician, philosopher, theologian, and translator. His full name is Abū Zayd Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq b. Sulaymān b. Ayyūb al-ʿIbādī, and he was known in medieval Europe as Johannitius. He was born in 808 near <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref>, where his father was a pharmacist. He likely grew up bilingual in Arabic and Syriac, and he acquired an excellent knowledge of Greek as well as Persian in the course of his education. Ḥunayn studied medicine in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> under the famous physician Yūḥannā b. Māsawayh (d. 857), who stemmed from one of the prominent medical families of Gondeshapur (<ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>). In Baghdad, Ḥunayn became well-known as one of the foremost translators of Greek texts into Syriac and Arabic. In addition to his translation activity, Ḥunayn was also the personal physician of Caliph al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–61). He died in Baghdad in 873.</p>
<p>Ḥunayn is best known for the central role that he played in the Graeco-Arabic translation movement of the early Abbasid period (in general, see Gutas). His translation activity was carried out in conjunction with a number of his students, including his son Isḥāq b. Ḥunayn (d. 910), his nephew Ḥubaysh b. al-Ḥasan, ʿĪsā b. Yaḥyā, and Isṭifān b. Bāsīl. Ḥunayn and his school translated well over a hundred Greek medical works, including Hippocrates, Dioscorides, as well as almost the entire corpus of <ref type="cr">Galen</ref>. In addition to medicine, they translated Greek philosophical and scientific texts, including Plato, <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>, Proclus, and <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>. A number of fascinating insights into the philological method of Ḥunayn and his school can be gleaned from Ḥunayn’s ‘Letter to ʿAlī b. Yaḥyā on Galen’s books which have been translated …’ (<i>Risāla ilā ʿAlī</i><i> ibn Yaḥyā fī dhikr mā turjima min kutub Jālīnūs …</i>; ed. with GT in Bergsträsser 1925, 1932; ET Lamoreaux). In this Letter, Ḥunayn reports that he travelled throughout Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt in order to procure Greek mss. of works that he wished to translate. He often collated multiple mss. of a given work in order to obtain a sound textual basis for his translations. In his translations, he seems to have adopted a <i>sensus de sensu</i>approach departing from the literal <i>verbum e verbo</i>approach that characterized 6th- and 7th-cent. Syriac translations from Greek (see Brock; see also <ref type="cr">Greek, Syriac translations from</ref>). In some cases, Ḥunayn revised older translations, such as those by <ref type="cr">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref> (d. 536) and <ref type="cr">Iyob of Edessa</ref> (d. ca. 835?). In other cases, however, he states that the existing translations were so poor that it was necessary for him to begin anew from the Greek. Ḥunayn translated from Greek into both Syriac and Arabic (usually via Syriac) depending on the request of his patron. In a number of cases, Ḥunayn first translated the Greek into Syriac, and after that one of his students translated the Syriac into Arabic, which Ḥunayn then corrected against the Greek.</p>
<p>In addition to his vast body of translation work, Ḥunayn was an important author in his own right. In his <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>Uyūn al-</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>anbā</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i> fī ṭabaqā</i><i>t al-</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>aṭibbā</i>, Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa (d. 1270) attributes 111 works to Ḥunayn (ed. A. Müller, <i>Ibn Abi Useibia</i> [1884], 184–200). Most of Ḥunayn’s works are in the field of <ref type="cr">medicine</ref>, and a majority of these medical works are epitomes, paraphrases, or summaries of Greek works. Among Ḥunayn’s best known original works in medicine is his ‘Introduction to medicine’ (<i>Kitāb al-mudkhal fī al-ṭ</i><i>ibb</i>). The substance of this text is also found in catechetical form in his ‘Book of medical questions’ (<i>Kitāb al-masā</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>il al-ṭibbiyya</i>), which also exists in Syriac (see Degen) and which in its Latin translation remained authoritative through the Middle Ages. In addition, Ḥunayn authored several important works on ocular medicine, including the ‘Ten treatises on the eye’ (<i>al-ʿAšr maqālāt fī al-ʿayn</i>; ed. with ET Meyerhof) and the ‘Book of questions on the eye’ (<i>Kitāb al-masā</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>il fī al-ʿayn</i>; ed. with FT Sbath and Meyerhof).</p>
<p>Ḥunayn is said to have written several works on grammar, including ‘The rules of inflexion according to the Greeks’ (<i>Kitāb fī aḥkām al-iʿrā</i><i>b ʿalā madhab al-yūnāniyyīn</i>), ‘Book on syntax’ (<i>Kitāb fī al-naḥw</i>), and ‘Book of the diacritical points’ (<i>Kitā</i><i>b al-nuqaṭ</i>). In his ‘Catalogue’, <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (d. 1318) also attributes a grammar to Ḥunayn (Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 3.1, 165). In addition, Ḥunayn is said to have written several works on Syriac lexicography, including the ‘Book of similar words’ (<i>Ktābā da-šmāhe dāmyā</i><i>ye</i>; ed. Hoffmann, 2–49 along with Gottheil 1887, 61*–67*; 1889), the ‘Explanation of Greek words in Syriac’ (<i>Puššāq šmāhe yawnāye b-suryāyā</i>), and a Compendious Lexicon (<i>Lehksiqā</i><i>wn</i> 
<i>b-pāsiqātā</i>). These lexicographical works laid the foundation for the Syriac-Arabic lexicon of Ḥunayn’s student <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar ʿAli</ref> (second half of the 9th  cent.) as well as that of <ref type="cr">Ḥasan bar Bahlul</ref>(mid-10th cent.) (see <ref type="cr">Lexicography</ref>).</p>
<p>Ḥunayn also authored several works of a religious character, of which the following have been edited: ‘Treatise on human destiny’ (<i>Maqāla fī</i><i> al-ājāl</i>; ed. Samir 1991; see also his study in <i>ARAM</i>31 [1991], 171–92), ‘Book on the comprehension of the truth of religions’ (<i>Kitāb fī idrāk ḥaqīqat al-adyā</i><i>n</i>; title varies; ed. with FT Cheikho; ed. Sbath 1929; ed. Samir 1997), and the related response to ʿAlī b. Yaḥyā al-Munajjim (ed. with FT Samir and Nwyia). Unpublished or lost works of a religious character include: <i>Risāla fī dalālat al-qad(a)r ʿalā al-tawḥī</i><i>d</i>(exact meaning uncertain, but dealing with the unity of God), ‘Treatise on the creation of humanity and that it was for the benefit and favor (of humanity) that it was made needy’ (<i>maqāla fī khalq al-insān wa-annahū min maṣlaḥatihi wa-al-tafaḍḍul ʿalayhi juʿila muḥ</i><i>tājan</i>), ‘Book on the history of the world’ (<i>Kitāb ta</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>rīkh al-ʿālam</i>), and (in Syriac) ‘Chapters on the fear of God’ (<i>Reše d-deḥlat alāhā</i>).</p>
<p>Finally mention should be made of Ḥunayn’s <i>Kitāb ādāb al-falāsifa</i>, also known as <i>Nawādir al-falāsifa</i>, which is primarily a collection of sayings of Greek and Persian sages and philosophers (ed. Badawi; cf. Griffith).</p>

<LemmaTitle>Ibn al-Ṭayyib</head><ab type="infobox"/> (d. 1043) [Ch. of E.]
<p>Priest, theologian, exegete, physician, translator, and philosopher. His full name is Abū al-Faraj ʿAbd Allāh Ibn al‑Ṭayyib al-ʿIrāqī. He worked at the ʿAḍūdiyya Hospital in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> and served as secretary to both Cath. Yūḥannā b. Nāzūk (r. 1012–22) and Cath. <ref type="cr">Eliya I</ref> (r.  1028–49). He was a student of al-Ḥasan b. Suwār b. al-Khammār (d. after 1017), who himself was a student of <ref type="cr">Yaḥyā b. ʿ<ref type="cr">Adī</ref> (d. 974). Ibn al-Ṭayyib’s students include ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā al-kaḥḥāl (d. after 1010), Abū al-Ḥusayn al-Baṣrī (d. 1044), and Ibn Buṭlān (d. 1066). He was also a contemporary of Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna).</p>
<p>Ibn al-Ṭayyib’s oeuvre includes more than forty items, all in Arabic, that span the fields of philosophy, medicine, theology, exegesis, and canon law. In philosophy, he wrote commentaries on the ‘Isagoge’ of <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref> (ed. Gyekye) and on several works by <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>, including the ‘Categories’ (ed. Ferrari; ed. ʿAlī Ḥusayn al-Jābirī et al.). In medicine, he wrote several treatises in addition to commentaries on Hippocrates and <ref type="cr">Galen</ref>. Among Ibn al-Ṭayyib’s most significant works in theology is his biblical commentary entitled <i>Firdaws al-naṣr</i><i>āniyya</i>‘The Paradise of Christianity’ (Gen. ed. with FT Sanders). This exegetical work draws upon various Syriac sources, including the Scholion of <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>(fl. end of the 8th cent.), the ‘Selected Questions’ of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref>(d. 828), and the commentaries of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>(fl. ca. 850), and it served as one of the primary bridges by which E.-Syr. biblical exegesis reached <ref type="cr">Coptic Christianity</ref>and <ref type="cr">Ethiopic Christianity</ref>. In addition to the <i>Firdaws al-naṣrāniyya</i>, Ibn al-Ṭayyib wrote separate commentaries on the Psalms (ed. Manquriyūs and Jirjis) and the Gospels (ed. Manquriyūs; cf. Faultless) as well as (probably) translated the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref> into Arabic (see Baarda). He also authored a number of theological treatises. Finally, mention should be made of his <i>Fiqh al-naṣrāniyya</i>‘The law of Christianity’, which is a compilation of <ref type="cr">juridical literature</ref> of the Ch. of E. (ed. Hoenerbach and Spies).</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, martyred in Rome. His Letters (<i>CPG</i> 1025), written in Greek, survive in Syriac in three forms: 1. a short recension, consisting of ‘Letters to the Ephesians, the Romans, and Polycarp bishop of Smyrna’. This is known only in Syriac translation (ed. W. Cureton 1845, 1859; and W. Wright in J. B. Lightfoot, <i>The Apostolic Fathers</i>, vol. 2.3 [1889], 75–92); the Letter to the Romans was already quoted by <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref> (ed. Rignell, <i>Briefe</i> [1941], 90). The Syriac was later translated into Armenian and Arabic; 2. the middle recension, consisting of four further Letters (to the Christians of Magnesia, Tralles, Philadelphia, and Smyrna); all seven are generally thought to be genuine; and 3. a long recension with some further letters, as well as interpolations in the seven genuine ones.</p>
<p>The account of Ignatius’s martyrdom (<i>CPG</i> 1036) was also translated into Syriac (ed. Wright, in Lightfoot, <i>Apostolic Fathers</i>, vol. 2.3, 103–24; and ed. Bedjan, <i>Acta Martyrum et Sanctorum</i>, vol. 3, 199–214).</p>

<p>He was born in <ref type="cr">Barṭelle</ref> of Tuma Gabriel Mari and Shmuni Isḥaq Mtuka, and was given the baptismal name Shābā (ʿAbd al-Aḥad). He attended the seminary at <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> in 1923, and in 1931 began teaching at <ref type="cr">Taw Mim Simkath</ref> in <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>. He became a monk in 1933. He was sent to India in the same year where he was ordained a deacon and a priest. He returned in 1946 to <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>. In 1950 he was consecrated a bp. for Beirut and Syria, then Patr. in 1957. He transferred the patriarchate from <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref> to <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>. Under his patriarchate, the diocesan map of the church changed as a result of continuous migration to the West. He signed an agreement of understanding with Pope Paul VI in 1971. He mastered liturgical music which he studied under Julius Elias Qoro while he was stationed in Malankara. In 1960, during a visit to NJ, he recorded the entire <i>Beth Gazo</i>, the W.-Syr. musical reference, on reel tapes. He composed a collection of Syriac poems published under the title <i><cCase:All Caps>m</i><cCase:><i>imre mgabayo</i> (Aleppo, 1959). His other works, all in Arabic, include a history of the church (2 vols.; 1953 and 1957), a history of the Syr. Orth. Church in India (1951; ET by M.

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Iḥidāyā</LemmaTitle>
<p>The ‘solitary (one)’, a Syriac term for individuals engaged in ascetic and monastic endeavors, and for the Second Person of the Trinity. The root is <i>yḥd</i> ‘one’, used by <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref> and <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> to describe members of the consecrated elite of the Syr. church in the pre-monastic period. The ‘solitary one(s)’ or ‘single(s)’ had several connotations and contexts: 1. an individual who underwent ascetic disciplines removed from human society, often in isolated wilderness regions; 2. a person who was single, alone, unmarried, and celibate; 3. a person who was ‘single-minded’, not divided in heart and allegiance to God; and 4. a person who sought to emulate the Only Begotten One (Greek <i>monogenēs</i>; Syr. <i>iḥidāyā</i>) or Christ. In Aphrahaṭ, <i>iḥidāyā</i> functions as an equivalent of <i>bar</i>/<i>ba(r)t qyām</i><i>ā</i> ‘son/daughter of the covenant’ (see <ref type="cr">Bnay qyāmā</ref>, <ref type="cr">Bnāt qyāmā</ref>), a more defined group of ascetics in the local church. ‘Solitary’ or ‘single’ in the sense of a person voluntarily isolated from contact with society did not apply here, for these individuals typically lived in small communities, so that the allusion to Christ the <i>iḥidāyā</i> was primary. Griffith has suggested ‘singles in God’s service’ as a better understanding of the sense of the term.</p>
<p>Some believe that the Greek term <i>monachos</i> ‘monk’ was called into use to render Syr. <i>i</i><i>ḥidāyā</i>, not the reverse as is usually assumed.</p>
<p>By the late 5th to early 6th cent., <i>iḥidāyā</i> came to denote the general term for a monk living in community in a monastery. <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (d. 521) wrote two <i>memre</i> ‘On the <i>iḥid</i><i>āye</i>’ (nos. 137–8) (ed. P. Bedjan, <i>Homiliae ­Selectae Mar-Jacobi Sarugenesis</i>, vol. 4, 818–71) in which the <i>iḥidāye</i> are clearly located in a monastery. In later usage <i>iḥidāyā</i> means ‘hermit’, ‘solitary’ (though still attached loosely to a monastery).</p>

<Author>R. A. Kitchen</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Inscriptions 
</LemmaTitle><p>Inscriptions in a broad sense include texts written on any substrate other than ms. (which itself may be of parchment, <ref type="cr">papyrus</ref>, or paper) such as stone, pottery, plaster, mosaic, wood, metal, coins, liturgical objects and vestments, and paintings. The writing technique may also vary widely: from carving or punching into metal, chiseling in stone, to incising, embroidering, and painting, or simple writing. Similar to archeological artifacts, inscriptions reach us directly rather than at the end of a process of transmission.</p>
<p>The earliest, ‘Old Syriac’, inscriptions predate Syr. Christianity and reflect the pagan Aramaic civilization of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> and Osrhoene between the early 1st and the middle of the 3rd cent. (the earliest dated inscription is from 6). The inscriptions are on stone, mosaic, pottery, and coins. Many have a funerary context. The <ref type="cr">script</ref> is close to the later Syriac Esṭrangela, with some evidence, especially in the mosaics, of a more cursive script. The inscriptions reflect an archaic and less standardized form of the <ref type="cr">Syriac language</ref>. An important morphological feature appears in the 3rd pers. masc. sing of the imperfect form of the verb, for which early inscriptions have a preformative <i>yodh</i> rather than <i>nun</i>, the latter being one of the hallmarks of later Syriac (there also is evidence that <i>yodh</i> and <i>nun</i> coexisted for some time). The recent collection by Drijvers and Healey (1999) contains ca. 100 items. 
A few new ones have been published in recent years (see esp. Healey 2006, dated 194). Three mid-3rd-cent. legal documents, written on parchment and discovered in or around <ref type="cr">Dura-Europos</ref>, reflect the same cultural milieu prior to, and outside of, Syr. Christianity, and are, therefore, often studied in conjunction with the Edessene inscriptions (see <ref type="cr">Old Syriac documents</ref>).</p>
<p>There is a hiatus between the pagan and the earliest Christian Syriac inscriptions. The earliest Christian inscriptions from the Syriac-speaking area are in Greek, for example the Greek inscription in the baptistery of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> (dated 359/60), which <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> must have known. There is also a geographical shift. Whereas the ‘Old Syriac’ inscriptions are only found to the east of the Euphrates, Christian Syriac inscriptions appear west of the Euphrates from the late 4th cent. onwards. Among the earliest dated Christian Syriac inscriptions is a bilingual Greek-Syriac inscription from Babisqa, to the southwest of <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>, dated 389.</p>
<p>Christian Syriac inscriptions become more numerous in the 5th cent. and continue to the present day. Many have been unearthed starting in the 19th cent. Although some remained <i>in situ</i>, others were transferred to museums worldwide or ended up in private collections. For many inscriptions, in particular those that came to light outside regular excavations, the provenance and archeological context are not known. The main geographical areas will be briefly surveyed here, with special reference to the most recent publications (for basic references, see Briquel Chatonnet et al. 2004).</p>
<label type="subsubsection">Syria</label>
<p>Many inscriptions are known from the hinterland of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, from the <ref type="cr">Apamea</ref> and Aleppo region, and further east, from the Middle Euphrates. They include monumental inscriptions on stone and mosaic, which often refer to building activities and contain dates and names of bishops or other historical figures. Important examples of recently published mosaic inscriptions are: an inscription from Huweija Halawa, on the Euphrates, 471 (Donceel-Voûte 1988, 148–9); an inscription of unknown provenance, now in New Jersey, 504 (Steiner 1990); an inscription from Tall Biʿa, near Kallinikos, 509, mentioning bp. <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Kallinikos</ref> (Krebernik 1991); and an inscription from Maʿar Zayta, 514/15, mentioning bp. Peter of Apamea (Harrak 1995). From the northeast of the country, inscriptions from Tell Tuneinir (Fuller 1998) and Qasrok (Talay 2003) have been published in recent years.</p>
<label type="subsubsection">Ṭur ʿAbdin</label>
<p>The inscriptions from this region have been conveniently brought together by Palmer (1987). This publication includes improved editions of previously known inscriptions as well as a number of new ones. The earliest dated inscription is from the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref>, 534. 
A significant number of inscriptions are dated or datable to the 8th cent. In addition to building inscriptions, there are a number of funerary texts, often written in a literary, semi-formulaic language.</p>
<label type="subsubsection">Iraq</label>
<p>An edition by A. Harrak appeared in 2010. Although the earliest dated inscription is from 709/10, some undated inscriptions may be earlier. For the early period, inscriptions from <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref> help to reconstruct the Christian history of that important city. An ostracon from the <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref> region, which came to light in the 1980s, contains quotations from the E.-Syr. <i>Ḥudrā</i> for the season of Epiphany (Brock 2004). The funerary inscriptions from the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Rabban Hormizd</ref> near <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref> belong to the modern period (15th–19th cent.) (Harrak 2003).</p>
<label type="subsubsection">Central Mesopotamia</label>
<p>In Central Mesopotamia, in the pre-Islamic and early-Islamic period a number of magical texts were written in Syriac (while similar texts from the same region exist in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic and Mandaic). There are charms for the love-sick and prayers against illness or other misfortune. Many bowls have been unearthed on which the text is written in spiral fashion around the inside, while other texts are written on sheets of leather or metal. Syriac texts are written either in Esṭrangela or in a script that has been called ‘Proto-Manichean’. Moriggi (2004) recently studied the language of the bowls; three leather amulets were published by Gignoux (1987).</p>
<label type="subsubsection">Egypt</label>
<p>Syr. monks left traces of their presence in several of the early Egyptian monasteries. The most important collection of Syriac inscriptions is from <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>, where painted inscriptions start appearing on the walls of the main church ca. 800. In addition to independent painted inscriptions recording building activities, visits, the passing away of monks, or other significant events, there are Syriac names and captions on wall paintings. Important inscriptions on the wooden doors of the church are from the period of abbot <ref type="cr">Mushe of Nisibis</ref> in the first half of the 10th cent., while a liturgical fan in bronze carries a beautiful inscription dated 1202/3.</p>
<label type="subsubsection">Central and East Asia</label>
<p>Along the Silk Road Syriac inscriptions are an important testimony to the mission work of the Ch. of E. in Central and East Asia. Many Syriac graffiti have come to light in Urgut, Uzbekistan, and numerous tombstones, inscribed with Syriac and dated or datable between the mid–13th and mid–14th cent. have been found in Kyrgyzstan, where the capital Bishkek must have had a sizable community. Further east, in <ref type="cr">China</ref>, the stele of Si-ngan-fou (in <ref type="cr">Xi’an</ref>), dated 781, is among the most well-known Syriac inscriptions. In addition to its long Chinese text, it has a Syriac list of bishops, monks, and other ecclesiastics. Many Syriac inscriptions from the 13th and 14th cent., mostly of funerary content, have been found near the city of Huocheng (in Xinjiang) as well as in inner Mongolia, near Beijing, and in the harbor towns of Yangzhou and Quanzhou. For preliminary assessments of these texts, see the publications by Klein (2001), Niu Ruji (2004, 2005), and Borbone (2005).</p>
<label type="subsubsection">Elsewhere</label>
<p>A smaller number of Syriac inscriptions exist in Iran. Many are from the region around <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref> and mostly belong to the modern period. The Syriac inscriptions in Kerala, India, are dated between the 16th cent. and the present day; a volume by F. Briquel Chatonnet, A. Desreumaux, and J. Thekeparampil has recently appeared. In Lebanon the situation is more complex. The earliest inscription, on a lintel, is dated 547/8; several 8th-cent. inscriptions of Kamid al-Loz reflect the presence of an E.-Syr. community; and many inscriptions are found on wall paintings in medieval and modern Maronite and Greek-Orthodox churches. Pilgrims and visitors from the Syriac homelands left Syriac inscriptions on the Sinai Peninsula, in Cyprus, and in Palestine/Israel. The Syriac inscriptions at the entrance of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> were recently published and studied by Brock, Goldfus, and Kofsky (2006–2007).</p>
<label type="subsection">Conclusion</label>
<p>Syriac inscriptions reflect the linguistic and cultural complexities of the worlds in which Syriac Christians lived. Whereas in the earliest period Syriac inscriptions often show the coexistence of Syriac and Greek (and of Syriac, Greek, and Arabic in the famous inscription of Zebed, to the southeast of Aleppo, dated 511/2), many of the later inscriptions include, or are accompanied by, texts in Coptic, Arabic, Chinese, Uigur, Turkic, and Malayalam, or show interesting cases of <ref type="cr">Garshuni</ref>, i.e. the use of the Syriac script to write non-Syriac languages. A similar complexity is found in the use of different eras. Although in the early period local eras are occasionally used (esp. the ones of Antioch and Apamea), and the dating by ‘indiction’ (Syr. <i>hndqṭywn</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ) is exceptionally found, the most common dating system throughout the centuries is the era of the Seleucids (known as ‘of Alexander’, ‘of the Macedonians’, or ‘of the Greeks’). The Hijra dating is found as early as the 8th cent., and for the later period many local eras are used as well as the common Christian era. Finally, it should be noted that inscriptions have contributed to our understanding of the writing direction in Syriac, as distinct from the reading direction. Most Syriac inscriptions are written vertically, inscribed downwards (Voigt 1997).</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Isaiah of Scetis</head><ab type="infobox"/>Abba Isaiah
<p>Greek monastic writer of uncertain identity; author of the Asceticon (<i>CPG</i> 5555). Two possible Isaiah’s are known, Isaiah of Scetis (early 5th cent.) and Isaiah of Gaza (d. 491). The suggestion (by G. Krüger, in <i>Die sogenannte Kirchengeschichte des Zacharias Rhetor</i>, ed. K.  Ahrens and G. Krüger [1899], 385–6), that these two were really a single person, was widely accepted until Draguet’s edition of the Syriac translation. Draguet firmly distinguished the two and saw the Asceticon as the work of Isaiah of Scetis. Subsequent scholarship has hesitated in accepting this, but a possible solution is that the earliest form of the work (now discernable through Draguet’s edition) goes back to Isaiah of Scetis, while the later form represents the editorial work of Isaiah of Gaza, a friend of <ref type="cr">Peter the Iberian</ref> and of <ref type="cr">Severus</ref> (this Isaiah’s Life was written by <ref type="cr">Zacharias</ref>; ed. with LT, by E. W.  Brooks [CSCO 7–8; 1907]). The identity, or otherwise, of the two Isaiah’s is reflected in recent dictionary articles: some treat them together (thus Regnault), while others deal with them separately (thus Aubert). The Syriac translation of the Asceticon survives in many mss. and (for several of the Discourses) in two different forms. The work was clearly widely read in Syriac monastic circles, both East and West. In the late 7th cent. <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref> composed an extensive commentary on it, and a further anonymous commentary is also preserved in an incomplete form.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Isḥaq</head><ab type="infobox"/>(ca. 399/400–410/11) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, and Cath. A native of Kashkar, Isḥaq was elected Cath. in the first year of Yazdgard  I (r. 399–420), after a long period of persecution and hardship for the Christians in the Persian Empire. Relations between the Roman and Persian Empires improved at the end of the 4th cent. In this new political environment, Isḥaq was able to lay the foundation for the organization of the Christian communities, with the formal approval of the Persian authorities. In this process Isḥaq worked together with bp. <ref type="cr">Marutha of Maypherqaṭ</ref>, an envoy from the Roman Empire. The Synod of 410, held in Seleucia-Ctesiphon, was the highlight of Isḥaq’s tenure. Its official account is preserved in the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. The text of the account is followed by a Creed, by 21 canons, and by 33 signatures of bishops. Some canons deal with the organization of the church, church discipline, and the relations among bishops. Along with the see of Seleucia-Ctesiphon (whose incumbent is given primacy ‘in all the regions of the East’, canon  12), the following five cities have metropolitan bishops (canon  21): <ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref> (Beth Huzaye), <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, Prat and Mayshan, <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>, and Karka. Other canons contain instructions about liturgy (canon  9) and about the celebration of Christian feasts (canon 13). Some canons specifically aim at creating uniformity between East and West (i.e. Christianity within the Roman Empire) and parallels exist with canons of the Council of Nicea (325) and of other councils within the Roman Empire. In addition to <ab type="infobox"/>the Synodicon Orientale, the creed and the canons of the synod are also preserved in the Syr. Orth. tradition (published by Lamy). For the creed, the latter has preserved a more original text, while the E.-Syr. text underwent later revision. The tone of the entire account is very optimistic with regard to both the peaceful coexistence of the Roman and Persian Empires and the freedom given to Christians to practice their religion and to organize themselves. Only a few years later, however, the situation of Christians in the Persian Empire again deteriorated. The synod of 419 (under Cath. <ref type="cr">Yahbalaha</ref>) clearly reflects the increased tension, while the Synod of 424 (under Cath. <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref>) was held in an atmosphere of crisis. As evidenced in the <ab type="infobox"/>Synodicon Orientale, however, Isḥaq’s work retained its significance and continued to be seen as foundational for the organizational structure of the Ch. of E.</p>

<p>Priest and writer. One of three early persons named Isḥaq whose works may have survived in a single corpus (see <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Antioch</ref> and <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Edessa</ref>). According to a letter from <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> to <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Litarba</ref> (Letter 14; ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,172, f. 123r–v), this Isḥaq was a student of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> while he was in <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>, and then continued his studies there under Ephrem’s pupil Zenobius. It is more likely that Isḥaq studied with Zenobius than with Ephrem. In any case, after his studies, according to Yaʿqub’s letter, Isḥaq journeyed to Rome and to Constantinople during the time of Arcadius (395–408). This report probably identifies him with the Isḥaq mentioned in both the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>of Mitylene (I.9) and the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>(I.193). According to the same letter of Yaʿqub, Isḥaq composed one <i>memrā</i> on the secular games held in Rome and another on the fall of Rome to Alaric in 410. Neither of these <i>memre</i>, however, has survived. After his stay in Constantinople, during which time he had been imprisoned for unknown reasons, he returned to his native Amid and then became a priest. The date of his death is unknown.</p>

<p>Priest and writer. According to a letter from <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> to <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Litarba</ref> (Letter 14; ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,172, f. 123r–v), Isḥaq was a well-known priest in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> who flourished during the time of the emperor Zeno (ca. 474–91). During the time of Peter the Fuller (ca. 471–88), Isḥaq went to <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> where he became involved in the controversy then raging over the Trisagion. According to Yaʿqub (cf. also, <i>Chronica Minora</i>, vol.  2, 217), Isḥaq saw a man who was carrying around a parrot that had been trained to recite the Trisagion against those who opposed its addition to the liturgy. Isḥaq was so impressed by this sight that he wrote a long <i>memrā</i> on this event. It is the longest <i>memrā</i> in the collection of his works and is perhaps his best known title, though its contents are far less known. It is likely that this is the same Isḥaq whom the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Edessa</ref> and other sources claim flourished in the 450s. The Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> (II.viii.9) and the dependent Ecclesiastical Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (I.165) both seem to have conflated this Isḥaq with <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Edessa</ref>.</p>
<p>To this Isḥaq is attributed a very large corpus of works which remains only partially and incompletely edited. Approximately two hundred works have been identified, nearly all of which are <i>memre</i> written in the seven syllable meter. Many are on ascetic subjects, although there are many on biblical and theological themes. Some of these works have also been combed for the data they reveal on contemporary practices of local pagan worship. All the works in this corpus cannot have come from the same hand. Although their early transmission is almost entirely in mss. of W.-Syr. provenance, the later ms. tradition occasionally attributes some of them to the great E.-Syr. mystic <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>.</p>

<p>Priest and theological writer. Even less is known of this Isḥaq than of <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Amid</ref><LemmaTitle></LemmaTitle>and <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Antioch</ref>. According to a letter of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> to <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Litarba</ref> (Letter 14; ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,172, f. 123r–v), our only source of information, this Isḥaq was a priest of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> during the early part of the 6th cent. During the tenure of Pawlos as Metropolitan of Edessa (510–522), Isḥaq was of the orthodox (i.e. miaphysite) party. However, when Pawlos was deposed and subsequently replaced by Asclepius, a Chalcedonian, Isḥaq switched camps and became a Chalcedonian. In support of his new party, Isḥaq wrote a number of <i>memre</i> against non-Chalcedonian positions. Certain <i>memre</i> against ‘Nestorians’ in the collection of Isḥaq of Antioch may, however, be from this Isḥaq’s miaphysite period, when he may also have been that Isḥaq occasionally mentioned by <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> in his letters.</p>

<p>Influential monastic author. Originating from <ref type="cr">Beth Qaṭraye</ref>, he was made bp. of <ref type="cr">Nineveh</ref> (<ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>) by Cath. Gewargis (661–81), perhaps ca. 676/80. After a short while, however, he left (‘for reasons which only God knows’, as one of the two short biographical accounts puts it) and became a hermit, attached to the Monastery of Rabban Shabur, in the region of Shuster. His writings on monastic spirituality come down in several ‘Parts’, three of which are now known. The First Part, with 
82  chapters, evidently circulated widely, and much of it was translated into Greek at the Chalcedonian Monastery of Mar Saba (St. Sabbas), near <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>, in the late 8th or early 9th cent. From Greek, his works were subsequently translated into many other languages, in particular into Slavonic (whence they were included in the Russian edition of the ‘Philokalia’). This Greek translation also included (under Isḥaq’s name) three short works by <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref>, and an abbreviated form of <ref type="cr">Philo­xenos</ref>’s ‘Letter to Patricius’. The current printed editions of the Greek translation go back to that by N. Theotokis (1770), and have a different chapter numbering from that of the Syriac (a much-needed new edition of the Greek text is in preparation by M. Pirard). A Second Part, consisting of 41 chapters, is preserved complete in a single early ms. The long third chapter of this Part consists of four ‘Centuries’ of short sayings on spiritual knowledge (modelled on <ref type="cr">Evagrius</ref>’s ‘Kephalaia Gnostica’). A Third Part has also recently come to light, in a ms. in Tehran copied ca. 1900; this contains 17 chapters, two of which are duplicates with the First Part, and one with the Second Part. Though the Second and Third Parts were not translated into Greek, some chapters from them have been identified in Arabic, and they were both evidently known in Syriac monastic circles outside the Ch. of E., as well. The ‘Book of Grace’, probably by <ref type="cr">Shemʿon d-Ṭaybutheh</ref>, has sometimes been wrongly attributed to Isḥaq.</p>
<p>Isḥaq’s monastic spirituality draws on many ­sources, both Syriac and Greek (in Syriac translation); two authors would appear to have been particularly appreciated by Isḥaq, <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref> and Evagrius. His teaching lays great emphasis on the immensity of divine love and on the need for humanity to respond to this with wonder and humility.</p>

<p>Priest and author, also known as Asko Shbadnaya and Isḥaq Qardaḥa<LemmaTitle></LemmaTitle>Eshbadnaya. From his name, Isḥaq is presumed to be from a village named Shbaden or Shbad in ‘the land of the Sendaye’, a region northeast of Zakho. Isḥaq is known to have written several works, including three liturgical poems composed in 1439/40 for the Fast of the Ninevites, the commemoration of St. George, and the Feast of the Finding of the Cross. Isḥaq’s masterpiece is a long poem entitled ‘Poem on the Divine Economy from In the Beginning Until Eternity’, divided into 30 <i>sedre</i> or sections, each on a separate theme. This poem employs numerous acrostic patterns and includes dozens of Greek words written in Syriac script. The Greek words and some obscure Syriac words are supplied with interlinear or marginal definitions in Syriac or, rarely, Arabic. After most sections of poetry, Isḥaq added a section of commentary explaining his poem by means of quotations from earlier Syriac and Greek authors ranging from <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> and Irenaeus to <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mospuestia</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref>. Some of these quotations are extensive. In composing a commentary on his own poem, Isḥaq may have been imitating <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ of Nisibis</ref>, who also composed a commentary on his own poetry. Isḥaq also composed an acrostic riddle of six lines which was often transmitted with his liturgical poems. Finally, a short acrostic poem about the trials afflicting the Church, which is contained in a single ms. of Isḥaq’s masterpiece, is probably also composed by Isḥaq. The continued importance of Isḥaq is indicated by the large number of mss. of his works and the fact that he is one of the few later authors included in histories of Syriac literature and cited by <ref type="cr">Toma Audo</ref> in his Syriac dictionary.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Ishoʿ bar Nun</head><ab type="infobox"/> (d. 828) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>Cath. (823–28), author of commentaries on the entire Bible. Ishoʿ bar Nun was born in the village of Beth Gabbare on the Tigris, near <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, around 745. He studied with <ref type="cr">Abraham bar Dashandad</ref> and, possibly after a short period of teaching at <ref type="cr">Seleucia</ref>, became a monk at the Great Monastery on Mt. Izla (founded by <ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref>), where he also taught. Ishoʿ bar Nun later moved to <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> and then to Mosul, where he lived in the Monastery of Elijah. The chronology of these successive stays is highly uncertain as the many different sources provide at times conflicting information. In 823, Ishoʿ bar Nun was elected Cath. of the Ch. of E., as the successor of <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>, with whom he is said to have had a difficult relationship. He died in 828. Ishoʿ bar Nun should in all likelihood be distinguished from his namesake and contemporary who was bp. of Ram Hormizd in Beth Huzaye and who enjoyed the support of Timotheos, in whose letters he is occasionally mentioned.</p>
<p>In his capacity as cath., Ishoʿ bar Nun issued a number of canons, mainly dealing with matrimonial and hereditary law, which were incorporated in the collection of Syriac law books (ed. Sachau, with an addition by Sauget). In addition, Ishoʿ bar Nun is known as the ­author of a short treatise on homographs, which is extant in mss. in Iraq, but remains unpublished. His ‘Consolation Homilies’ and letters are only known in fragments. Ishoʿ bar Nun’s major work, which is preserved in its entirety (ms. Cambridge, Add. 2017), is his collection of ‘Selected Questions’ (<i>Šu</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾʾ<i>āle mgabbayyā</i>) on the OT and NT. Presenting his work in the form of questions and answers, Ishoʿ bar Nun conveys much of the traditional exegesis of the Ch. of E. and respectfully quotes <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. Yet, he often goes his own way, creating more room for spiritual and even allegorizing exegesis. He may have found the inspiration for this new approach in his monastic background and in his familiarity with the works of <ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>. Thus expanding the horizons of E.-Syr. biblical interpretation, he had a lasting impact on the later tradition, the more so since much of Ishoʿ bar Nun’s work was incorporated into the normative commentaries by <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>. Unfortunately, only small parts of the ‘Selected Questions’ have been published so far.</p>

(9th cent.) [Ch. of E.]
<p>Author of a Syriac Lexicon. From his <i>nisba</i>it is known that he was from Merv, an important city in the Abbasid period located on the lower course of the Murghab river in the northeast fringes of Persia. That he is the author of a Lexicon can be established from the preface to the Lexicon of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar ʿAli</ref> (second half of the 9th cent.). According to Bar <cTypeface:Italic>ʿAli’s patron, Abraham, the Lexicon of Ishoʿ of Merv was ‘composed irregularly and without order’ (<i>l</i><i>ā</i><i> m</i><i>ṭ</i><i>akks</i><i>ā</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>it wa-lbar men sedr</i><i>ā</i><i> ʿbid</i>). The definitions given by Ishoʿ of Merv are also said to differ at times from those in the Lexicon of <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref>(d. 873). Despite this somewhat negative evaluation, Bar ʿAli made use of the Lexicon of Ishoʿ of Merv, along with that of Ḥunayn, when compiling his own Lexicon.</p>
<p>According to R. Duval, Ishoʿ of Merv is to be identified with Zekarya of Merv, who is often cited in the Lexicon of <ref type="cr">Ḥasan Bar Bahlul</ref>(mid-10th cent.). Bar Bahlul, however, never explicitly identifies Zekarya of Merv with Ishoʿ of Merv. In addition, in one instance, Bar Bahlul cites Ishoʿ of Merv by name (Duval, 835.14). Thus, without further evidence, it seems best to assume that Ishoʿ of Merv and Zekarya of Merv are two distinct individuals (so also Baumstark).</p>
<p>A lexicographer from Merv is also mentioned in the ‘Catalogue’ of <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> (Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 3, 257–58), but it is unclear whether this person is to be identified with Ishoʿ of Merv or Zekarya of Merv.</p>

[Ch. of E.]
<p>Author of a treatise on secular law; metropolitan bp. of <ref type="cr">Fars</ref>. Ishoʿbokht was consecrated by Cath. Ḥenanishoʿ, most likely <ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ II</ref> (d. 779/80). He wrote his law book in Persian, from which language it was translated into Syriac at the instigation of Cath. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>, probably after Ishoʿbokht’s death. It is divided into six books. The first is of a general and theoretical nature. Books 2 and 3 deal with matrimonial law. Book 4 is devoted to inheritance law; book 5 to donations, testaments, and obligations. Book 6 deals with the right of appeal. Ishoʿbokht brings his knowledge of biblical law, Roman law, Persian law (and to some extent even Islamic law) together and aims at creating a unified system that would transcend local differences existing among Christians. Ishoʿbokht is familiar with traditions that are incorporated in the Persian ‘Book of thousand judgments’ (<i>Mādīgān ī haz</i><i>ār dādestān</i>) and his work has been used by scholars of Persian-Sasanian law (Macuch). Ishoʿbokht’s engagement with Zoroastrian law and customs was used by Sachau as an argument for dating him earlier than <ref type="cr">Shemʿon</ref>, from whose law book Zoroastrian doctrines and practices are largely absent (see under Shemʿon). Dauvillier regards Ishoʿbokht as a powerful and original mind, and perhaps the best jurist of the Ch. of E. (340). Preserved in the important ms. Alqosh Syr. 169, the primary source for the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>, this law book served as a source for later jurists. It also exists in an Arabic translation (see Sachau, xvi–xvii).</p>
<p>Ishoʿbokht’s knowledge and interest in philosophy seem to be reflected in some other works, extracts of which have been preserved: a commentary on the Ten Categories (e.g. in ms. Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Add. 2812,vii and in ms. Alqosh 65.5) and a note on ‘possibilities’ (<i>meṭṭol meddem d-metmaṣyānwā</i><i>tā ennen</i>: ms. Berlin 88.32). There is also an extract from a work that may have been dealing with the Hexaemeron (ms. Alqosh 45.3). None of these fragments have been edited or studied. It cannot be ascertained whether they all belong to the same author and whether they were originally written in Syriac.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Ishoʿdad of Merv</head><ab type="infobox"/>(fl. ca. 850) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>Bp. of Ḥdatta, author of commentaries on both the OT and NT. Little is known of Ishoʿdad’s biography. A native of the city of Maru or Merv, in present-day Turkmenistan, he became bp. of Ḥdatta (al-Ḥadītha), to the southeast of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, ca. 837. In 852, he was a candidate for the patriarchal throne, but he failed to be elected.</p>
<p>Ishoʿdad’s commentaries present the most expansive form of E.-Syr. biblical interpretation. They are preserved in a good number of mss. and they served as sources not only for subsequent E.-Syr. commentators, but also for W.-Syr. authors, such as <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>.</p>
<p>Both the theological concepts and the exegetical principles of the commentaries largely reflect the ideas of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> as they had developed and were transmitted in the later E.-Syr. schools. Works of other authors, however, were also part of the E.-Syr. exegetical tradition, especially those of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, <ref type="cr">Basil of Caesarea</ref>, the Cappadocians, and <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref>, as well as exegetical writings by various authors of the Schools of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> and <ref type="cr">Seleucia</ref>, among them <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>, Cath. Mar <ref type="cr">Aba</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Ḥenana</ref>of<ref type="cr"> Adiabene</ref>. The use of such a variety of sources sometimes led Ishoʿdad to distance himself from the interpretations of Theodore of Mopsuestia. A notable example is the commentary on the Song of Songs, for which Ishoʿdad juxtaposed the opinion of Theodore, who had expressed reservations as to the inspired character of the biblical book and its usefulness for the Christian reader, and the straightforward allegorical interpretations of authors such as <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nyssa</ref>, John Chrysostom, and others.</p>
<p>Some of the works that Ishoʿdad used had remained outside the scope of interest of his E.-Syr. predecessors. One example is the biblical commentaries of <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Emesa</ref>, excerpts of which Ishoʿdad incorporated in his work. Another example is the <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref>, the work of the Syr. Orth. bp. <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Tella</ref>, which was introduced in the Ch. of E. around 800 and from which Ishoʿdad was the first to draw biblical quotations of either the Septuagint or the later Greek versions (Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion).</p>

<p>Metropolitan of Prat d-Mayshan (Baṣra) and author. His <i>Ktābā d-nakputā</i>‘Book of Chastity’ (<i>Liber Castitatis</i>) concerns monastic foundations, mostly of the late Sasanian and early Arab periods. The work consists of 140 short notices about monastic figures, mostly founders of monasteries, beginning with <ref type="cr">Mar Awgen</ref> (traditionally dated to the 4th cent.) and continuing until the mid 9th cent. It has also been suggested (by Nautin) that he was the author of the Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref>, which survives only in Arabic (ed. A. Scher, in PO 4.3 [1907], 5.2 [1910], 7.2 [1910], and 13.4 [1918]); though it is not impossible, the suggestion remains doubtful. Ishoʿdnaḥ is also the author of a long poem (unpublished) on Mar Yawnan, founder of a famous monastery near <ref type="cr">al-Anbār</ref>. Several further works by him, including an Ecclesiastical History and a treatise on logic, have not been preserved.</p>

<p>Minor author, maph. (1687–1709), and Patr. (1709–23). Born in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, Isḥoq became a monk at <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> and was ordained priest in 1669 by Maph.

Isḥoq was consecrated bp. for the monastery in 1684 by Patr. ʿAbdulmasīḥ I. Later, he was installed as maph. in 1687 by his uncle Patr. <ref type="cr">Giwargis II</ref> and was given a mandate to govern the entire church, not just the East. He succeeded his uncle to the patriarchate in 1709; he was installed in <ref type="cr">Amid</ref> on 8 Feb. Due to deteriorating health, he voluntarily abdicated in 1723 and left for Mosul where he died in 1724. He was buried in the Church of Mor Thoma. Isḥoq wrote a brief grammar, mainly on morphology, in 15 chapters of which a few mss. survive.</p>

<p>Cath. (628–45) and author. Originating from Gdala (in <ref type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>), he evidently studied at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>, and was one of the group who left the School ca. 597 in protest against the teaching of the director, <ref type="cr">Ḥenana</ref>of<ref type="cr"> Adiabene</ref>. According to the Khuzistan Chronicle he had married ‘in his youth’, but nevertheless was appointed bp. of <ref type="cr">Balad</ref> (whether or not as a widower is unclear), before becoming Cath. In 630 he was sent by Queen Boran on an embassy to Heraclius, together with the future <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> and <ref type="cr">Sahdona</ref>; the meeting with the Byzantine emperor took place in <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>. Although late sources claim he corresponded with Muḥammad and met ʿUmar, in fact he appears to have left <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> when the city was taken by the Arabs in 637/8 and withdrawn to <ref type="cr">Karka</ref> in <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>. His only surviving writings are: a long letter to Rabban Abraham of Beth Madaye on christology (ed. Sako, with FT), a profession of faith (preserved only in Arabic; text and tr. in Sako, 59–60), and the <i>teš</i><i>boḥtā</i> ‘Our father in heaven, holy in his nature ...’, which is also attributed in some mss. to <ref type="cr">Babai the Great</ref>. The Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref> provides a Letter in reply to Barṣawma, bp. of Susa, who had accused Ishoʿyahb of compromising the christological position of the Ch. 
of E. when he met Heraclius; according to Sako, however, this is not genuine.</p>

<p>Patr. (649–59), author, and liturgical reformer. He was born in Kuplana (on the Greater Zab, in <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref>), the son of a prominent landowner named Bastomag. He became a monk of the nearby <ref type="cr"><cCase:All Caps>m<cCase:>onastery of Beth ʿAbe</ref>, but was appointed bp. of <ref type="cr">Nineveh</ref> (ca. 629), and a decade or so later, metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>, finally to become Cath. in 649. He is credited with many liturgical reforms, though the nature and extent of these is unclear; it seems that, among other things, it was he who limited the number of Anaphoras in use to the present three. In his ‘Catalogue’ <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> attributes to him the arrangement of the <i>Ḥ</i><i>udr</i><i>ā</i>, the Baptismal ­Liturgy, and rite for the Consecration of a new church; this attribution is also found in the mss. of all these, but the emergence of these liturgical books is likely to have been much more complex (in the case of the Baptismal Service, the mss. record a further reform by the Cath. Eliya  III [1176–90]). A set of Questions and Answers on liturgical topics (in ms. Mingana Syr. 566) is also attributed to him, but Van Unnik, who edited them, showed that they must belong to a later date, and he allocated them to <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb IV</ref>.</p>
<p>Ishoʿyahb III is much more certainly the author of a long ‘Life of Ishoʿsabran’, a martyr of the late Sasanian Empire (ed. Chabot, with French summary), and of a collection of 106 Letters (ed. R. Duval, with LT). The Letters are arranged chronologically in three groups, those written while he was bp. (52), while he was metropolitan (32), and while he was Cath. (22), though the chronological allocation in some cases cannot be correct. These convey a great deal of information about the life of the Ch. of E. during the period of the transition from Persian to Arab rule. (The edition by P. Scott-Moncrieff [1904] of Ishoʿyahb’s letters written while he was bp. omits Letters 1 and 12 in Duval’s edition; he gives handy brief summaries in English of each letter. His projected full translation never appeared).</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>; metropolitan bp. of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>; author, mostly writing in Arabic. He originated from the Nisibis region. He first became bp. of Mardin under the name Yawsep, and took the name Ishoʿyahb when he became ‘metropolitan bp. of Nisibis and Armenia’ (after the E.-Syr. metropolitan see of Khilat had been given up and added to Nisibis). Wright assumes that he became bp. of Nisibis in 1190; as bp. of Nisibis he is attested under Cath. Sabrishoʿ IV (1222–25); he must have died before 1233 (Teule 2006, 246).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Islam, Syriac Interactions with
</LemmaTitle><p>Syriac-speaking Christians, along with Arabic-speaking Christians whose patristic and liturgical heritage was largely Syriac, were among those Christians most immediately present to Islam in its origins. Throughout early Islamic history, especially in the period stretching from the earliest Islamic conquests in the territories of the Oriental Patriarchates in the first half of the 7th cent., up to the Mongol destruction of <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> in 1258 and beyond, interactions between Syriac Christians and Muslims were a regular feature of political, intellectual, and cultural life in the caliphate. Thereafter, and up to the present day, Syriac-speaking communities have continued to be a significant, cultural presence in the Islamic milieu, especially in the modern states of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, and Iran, where so-called ‘Neo-Aramaic’ dialects (see <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref>; <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref>; <ref type="cr">Ṭuroyo</ref>), with their roots in classical Syriac, are still spoken and the classical literature is still prized.</p>
<p>By the middle of the 7th cent., when Islamic rule was firmly established in the Levant, the main Christian, confessional communities among the Syriac-speaking peoples were already firmly established. In due course, Syriac- and Arabic-speaking Christians and Muslims alike came to refer to them as ‘Nestorians’, ‘Jacobites’, and ‘Melkites’, adopting the polemically inspired denominational labels devised by each community’s theological and Christological adversaries. Already in the 6th and early 7th cent., these communities were well established in the peripheral regions of Arabia (Hainthaler), with well-known congregations along the Persian Gulf, in Ḥaḍramawt and <ref type="cr">Nagran</ref> in south Arabia (Trimingham; Tardy), among the Lakhmids and Ghassanids on the north eastern and western fringes of the desert (Shahid), and the tribal groups Christianized by the monks of Palestine and the Sinai. From these peripheral locations among others, largely under Syriac and Aramaic influence, knowledge of Christian doctrine and practice, along with a considerable body of ecclesiastical lore, spread among the tribally organized, Arabic-speaking peoples of central Arabia and the Ḥijāz. By the time of the prophet Muḥammad (ca. 570–632), there was a significant level of awareness of Christianity in its Aramaic and Syriac expression, in the environs of Mecca and Yathrib/Medina, of its scriptures, traditions, and confessional formulae. The principal evidence for this relatively high quotient of awareness of Aramaic and Syriac Christianity in the Arabic-speaking milieu of 7th cent. Arabia is the Arabic Qurʾān itself. Scholars alternatively trace this awareness to the influence of a local ‘Jewish Christianity’ (De Blois; Gnilka), or to the actual presence of mainly ‘Jacobite’ and ‘Nestorian’ Christians in the Qurʾān’s audience, based on the text’s reflection of common eschatological and scriptural themes and its critiques of Christian doctrines and practices in their Syriac expression, as a growing body of scholarship in recent times is increasingly arguing (Andrae; Reynolds; Van der Velden; Griffith 2008).</p>
<p>Syriac interaction with Islam thus had its beginnings in the very origins of Islam, manifesting itself principally in the Islamic scripture; according to one estimate, Syriac loan words in the Arabic Qurʾān account for about seventy percent of the foreign vocabulary in the text (Mingana). This state of affairs, along with other considerations, has prompted some recent scholars to propose a hitherto unsuspected level of influence of the Syriac language even on the grammar and lexico­graphy of Qurʾānic Arabic (Luxenberg). Other scholars had already made use of other comparative data (Wansbrough) to propose a later, early 8th-cent., Syrian origin for Muḥammad, Islam, and the Qurʾān; some have gone so far as to postulate the development of Islam at this late date from a supposed heretical, pre-Nicene, Syriac Christianity, hitherto unrecognized by earlier Syriac scholars (Ohlig). While these latter hypotheses have gained little or no scholarly support for their specific conclusions, they nevertheless highlight the continuing importance of Syriac and Syriac studies for the scholarly investigation of Islamic origins in Late Antiquity.</p>
<p>Syriac writers were among the earliest, non-Muslim witnesses to the Islamic conquest and to the appearance of Islam as a new religious tradition. The so-far earliest known Christian reference to Muḥammad by name occurs in a Syriac chronicle composed around the year 640; the text mentions ‘a battle between the Romans and the Arabs of Muḥammad in Palestine twelve miles east of Gaza’ in the year 634 (Hoyland, 120). The chroniclers continued to record the interactions between Muslims and Christians well up into the Middle Ages, including records of battles, raids, massacres, martyrdoms, impositions of taxes, and other matters, including even accounts of the reigns of the caliphs and other aspects of Islamic history. These accounts have proven invaluable to historians of the early Islamic period, as independent records of events that are only sparsely reported or not reported at all in Islamic, Arabic sources of the time (Borrut). The great medieval, Syriac chronicles, such as the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> (d. 1199) and the anonymous <ref type="cr">Chronicle of 1234</ref>, incorporating the narratives of earlier chroniclers (e.g. <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref>), include biographies of Muḥammad and accounts of Islamic religious thought, along with reports of the encounters between Muslims and Christians. These encounters were often unfriendly and sometimes resulted in mass conversions to Islam. For example, a chronicler from the late 8th cent. says of the Syriac-speaking Christians in his era, in the region of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, that ‘the gates were opened to them to [enter] Islam. . . . Without blows or tortures they slipped towards apostasy in great precipitancy; they formed groups of ten or twenty or thirty or a hundred or two hundred or three hundred without any sort of compulsion. . . ., going down to <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref> and becoming Muslims. A great crowd did so, from the districts of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> and of Ḥarran and of <ref type="cr">Reshʿayna</ref>’ (Harrak, 324).</p>
<p>The earliest religious responses in Syriac to the challenge of Islam seem to have been in the apocalyptic genre. The most notable of these is the ‘<ref type="cr">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</ref>’, in all likelihood composed originally in Syriac by a Syr. Orth. writer in ca. 691 (Reinink 1993). The author explains how the interlude of Arab domination in time to come, all immediate evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, will not really disrupt the unfolding sequence of the four kingdoms of the prophecies in the book of Daniel, destined to end with the kingdom of the Greeks. Rather, he says, the depredations of the Arabs are part of God’s plan for the era of punishment for sin that is destined to usher in the final days of world history (Reinink 1992). The Apocalypse was soon translated into Greek and from that language was many times translated into other languages of the Christian west (Alexander). A number of other apocalyptic texts in Syriac from the same era elaborated on the same theme (Drijvers; Suermann). The most important of them was the Syriac <ref type="cr">Sargis Bḥira</ref> legend, soon revised into Arabic, which incorporated many of these apocalyptic themes into the story of Muḥammad’s encounter, following Islamic sources, with a Christian monk who recognized the sign of prophecy on the youthful prophet’s body. The 9th-cent. Syriac author told of the monk’s interactions with Muḥammad, including their dialogue about the major topics of Christian/Muslim controversy (Roggema). This ingenious narrative, which was destined to exert an enormous influence within the Syriac- and Arabic-speaking Christian communities of the Near East for centuries to come, incorporated an already popular genre in Christian/Muslim relations in Syriac, a literary dialogue between a Christian, often a monk, and a Muslim notable, in this instance Muḥammad himself.</p>
<p>The earliest of the Syriac, apologetic dialogue texts, like the apocalyptic narratives, also come from the early 8th cent. The earliest of them is a letter, written in the early 700s and preserved in a manuscript copied in 874, in which a now unknown writer tells of the occasion when the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of the Sedre</ref> (r. 631–648) was interrogated by a Muslim emir, ʿUmayr b. Saʿd al-Anṣārī, on Sunday, 9 May 644 (Nau, Penn) — even though this date has been questioned in recent research. They discuss the major doctrinal and practical issues between Christians and Muslims in such a way that the Christian dialogue partner successfully defends his faith, thereby offering the Christian Syriac reader of the text the confidence that Christians do have answers to the Islamic religious challenge and ways to show the truth of Christianity on the one hand and Islam’s shortfall on the other hand. Of the numerous compositions in this genre written in Syriac over the centuries, one might mention the most well known among them, works such as the account of the monk of Beth Ḥale with a Muslim emir (ca. 720) (Hoyland; Griffith 2000), the dialogue between a master and his disciple in Chapter 10 of <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>’s (ca. 792) ‘Scholion’ (Griffith 1981), Patr. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>’s (d. 823) account of his dialogue with the caliph, al-Mahdī, and Muslim scholars in the caliph’s <i>majlis</i> (Mingana; Putnam; Heimgartner), <ref type="cr">Nonos of Nisibis</ref>’s (d. after 861) apologetic treatise in Syriac (Van Roey), and <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>’s (d. 1171) long refutation of Islam in thirty chapters, distributed in three general discourses (Amar). Many anonymous texts of this sort are known in the ms. tradition, and a number of them, like Patr. Timotheos’s account of his dialogue with the caliph and his attendant scholars, were later translated into Arabic and enjoyed a wide circulation in the Christian communities in the Islamic world. As a matter of fact, many of the Christian Arabic writers of apologetic texts of this sort from the 9th cent. onward were Syriac-speaking Christians who had learned Arabic. The most well-known among the earliest of them were the ‘Melkite’ <ref type="cr">Theodoros Abū Qurra</ref> (ca. 755-ca. 830), the ‘Jacobite’ Ḥabīb b. Khidma Abū Rāʾiṭa (d. ca. 851), and the ‘Nestorian’ ʿAmmār al-Baṣrī (fl. ca. 850), whose apologetic texts in Arabic had a long and wide circulation among Middle Eastern Christians (Griffith 2008).</p>
<p>An interesting feature of these Christian apologetic texts in both Syriac and Arabic is that in them their authors developed an apologetic strategy for commending the reasonable credibility of the controversial Christian doctrines that took advantage of the modes of reasoning deployed by the contemporary Muslim theologians in the early development of an Islamic, systematic theology. In fact, it seems to have been the case that the Arabic-speaking, Muslim theologians developed their characteristic modes of reasoning in religious matters, the <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>ilm al-kalām</i>, very much in the course of their interactions with Syriac-speaking, Christian theologians in such intellectual centers as Baṣra and Baghdad in the late 8th and early 9th cent. (Cook). One catches a glimpse of the process in the Syriac letters of Patr. Timotheos I, who moved his residence from <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> to Baghdad, where he not only participated in a well-known debate at the caliph’s court, but where he also engaged in conversations with Muslim scholars. He tells about his experiences and recounts his conversations in several of his Syriac letters, addressed to a number of Christian correspondents (Hurst). In these letters he tells not only of his own experiences in conversation with Muslims but in three letters addressed to Christians in the environs of Baṣra he offers advice about how to discuss Christology in a Muslim dominated milieu (Griffith 2007). In these letters one acquires a glimpse into the circumstances of the origins not only of Muslim controversial theology, but of a Christian <i>kalām</i> as well, such as that displayed in the generation after Patr. Timotheos, in the Arabic works of ʿAmmār al-Baṣrī, in his interactions with the thought of his fellow Baṣrian, the Muʿtazilī, Muslim <i>mutakallim</i>, Abū Hudhayl al-ʿAllāf (d. ca. 840).</p>
<p>In Baghdad from the late 8th to the mid-11th cent. at least, Syriac-speaking, Christian intellectuals played a determining role in the multi-faceted intellectual undertaking known as the Graeco-Arabic translation movement in early Abbasid times (Gutas). Building on the earlier, intellectually important task of translating logical, philosophical, and other texts from Greek into Syriac in the context of the Christological controversies, especially by scholars in the Syr. Orth. community (Hugonnard-Roche), in the 9th and 10th cent. scholars who were mostly alumni of the several important schools of the Ch. of E., were engaged by mostly Muslim patrons to translate a whole range of texts from Greek into Arabic, embracing not only logical and philosophical texts from the Platonic and Aristotelian traditions, but medical, mathematical, and other scientific disciplines as well. Important participants in this undertaking were members of the Bokhtishoʿ family, with their connections with Gondeshapur (<ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>), the famous <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (808–73), with his family and associates from <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref>, and Abū Bishr Mattā b. Yūnus (d. 940) from the monastery of Dayr Qunnā, the community from which many Christian officials at the caliphal court in the 9th  cent. came originally (Massignon). It is important to see that these Syr. Christian intellectuals were not only translators for hire, but important scholars in their own right, who participated fully in the scholarly life of Baghdad in their time. Abū Bishr Mattā b. Yūnus is a case in point; not only was he one of the two Christian teachers of the Muslim philosopher Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī 
(ca. 870–950), the other one being Yuḥannā b. Ḥaylān (d. 910), Abū Bishr was also the champion of ‘Greek logic’ among the Christian and Muslim intellectuals of Baghdad. He defended the cause in a famous, if for him ill fated, debate between himself and the champion of the Muslim <i>mutakallimūn</i>, Abū Saʾīd al-Sīrāfī, who disdained ‘Greek logic’ in favor of the claims of theoretical Arabic grammar as a sufficient measure of the soundness of statements made in Arabic (Endress).</p>
<p>The most prominent philosopher in the third quarter of the 10th cent. in Baghdad was the Syr. Orth. Christian <ref type="cr">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (893–974), the student of al-Fārābī, and in turn the master of a circle of both Muslim and Christian disciples who became the mainstays of the Baghdad Aristotelians well into the 11th cent. Prominent among them was Yaḥyā’s Syr. Orth. disciple ʿĪsā b. Zurʿa (943–1008), who was a notable presence in the learned salons of the social elite of Baghdad in his time (Kraemer).</p>
<p>An interesting feature of the interaction between Syr. Christian and Muslim scholars in the 10th and 11th  cent. is the response made by Christian writers to positions taken by prominent Muslims in popular books written in Arabic that enjoyed a wide circulation in their time. For example, the Muslim philosopher Yaʿqūb b. Isḥāq al-Kindī (ca. 800 – ca. 867), who had been a patron of Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq, wrote a widely read essay called ‘The Art of Dispelling Sorrows’ that offered consolation on solely philosophical grounds. At least three Christian writers wrote responses to this text in Arabic (Griffith 1996), prominent among them being the 
Ch.  of E. prelate <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (975–1046), who became famous for his discussions about religion with the Muslim vizier Abū al-Qāsim al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAlī al-Maghribī (981–1027) (Samir). Similarly, the famous Muslim writer, Abū ʿUthmān ʿAmr b. Bahr al-Jāḥiẓ (777–868) had argued in his famous <i>Kitāb al-ḥayaw</i><i>ān</i> that lifelong sexual continence is impossible for humans. Both Yaḥyā b. ‘Adī and Eliya of Nisibis wrote treatises on sexual continence expressly to refute al-Jāḥiẓ’s claims and to commend the practice of sexual abstinence as an important virtue for one seeking moral perfection (Griffith 2006).</p>
<p>These and many other instances of the interactions between Syr. Christians and Muslims in the heyday of the Abbasid caliphs show clearly that Christians of the Syriac-speaking communities played a major role in the growth and development of classical Islamic culture in its origins. Their interactions continued into much later times. A major case in point is evident in the life and work of the Syr. Orth. polymath <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (1225–86). He composed important works in both Syriac and Arabic, and in his time he was well known not only among his co-religionists, but among Muslim intellectuals as well; he mentions the names and takes account of the positions of Muslim writers such as Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī, al-Jāḥiẓ, and al-Ghazzālī in his own works. In Syriac, Bar ʿEbroyo often wrote in the style current among Arabic-speaking writers of his day. As a matter of course, he takes Islamic points of view seriously in his work and in many ways he came the closest of all Syriac writers to something like a real dialogue with Islam; in his work there is a concern for scholarly objectivity, shown in his quotations from Islamic texts, that sets him apart from the earlier writers of dispute texts (Takahashi).</p>
<p>An important, but controversial area of interaction between Syriac Christianity and Islam is religious mysticism. Specifically, the question arises about the influence of Christian asceticism and mysticism in its Syr. expression, and especially in its E.-Syr. or Ch. of E. tradition, on Sufism in its early, especially Persian stages. Scholars have been divided in their opinions, with some pointing to the early development of Sufism in the very territories of the Syriac-speaking Christians and citing numerous parallels (e.g. Tor Andrae; Blum); others have emphasized the natural origins of Islamic mysticism in the Qurʾān and early Islamic tradition (Massignon). This is very much an area of Syriac interaction with Islam in which detailed, comparative study of texts has yet to be undertaken. Most scholars of Sufism simply ignore the Syr. ambience in which many of the early Sufi writers lived.</p>
<p>Not long after the ‘Syriac<ref type="cr"> Renaissance</ref>’ of the 12th and 13th centuries, when local languages gradually came to dominate both the intellectual and even the ecclesiastical and liturgical life of Syriac Christianity, at the expense of classical Syriac, interactions between Islam and Syriac Christianity nevertheless continued to be an important feature of life for the Christians living in Islamic polities. Syriac-speaking communities readily became fluent in the newly dominant languages of their homelands, be they Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish, or Persian, and in these and other languages, such as those of Central Asia, their interactions with Muslims have been continuous and their participation in public life in the Islamic milieu, especially in the Arabic-speaking world, has been significant especially in the cultural and political spheres. A notable instance of this interaction in modern times was the prominent place of Christian intellectuals in the promotion of Arab nationalism in the early to middle 20th cent (Hourani).</p>

Iwannis prohibited many priests who did not follow the Syr. Orth. tradition from performing ecclesiastical duties which led to much friction between him and the local bp.

<p>Natural philosopher, translator, and physician, active in Iraq in the first Abbasid cent., nicknamed ‘al-Abrash’, or ‘the Spotted’. The exact dates of his life are not known, but scholars estimate that he lived between 760 and 835. He was active in the time of the Abbasid caliph al-Maʾmūn (r. 813–33). Both Iyob and his son Ibrāhīm worked as physicians in the entourage of the Abbasid family. Iyob was sent by al-Maʾmūn to Khurasan to serve as ʿAbd Allāh b. Ṭāhir’s physician, when the latter became governor there in the early 830s. It seems unlikely that he would have been charged with such a task at the advanced age of 70; his estimated year of birth, probably based solely on <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s reference to Iyob (Abbeloos and Lamy, <i>Gregorii Barhebraei chronicon ecclesiasticum</i>, vol. 2, 181) as someone living in the era of Patr.<ref type="cr"> Timotheos I</ref>, is therefore probably too early. In the same passage, Bar ʿEbroyo calls Iyob a philosopher ‘who followed the doctrine of Nestorius’. Mingana interpreted this as Job having converted from the Melkite or Syr. Orth. to the Ch. of E., probably on account of his Edessene origins. However, historical references to his conversion are lacking, and the possibility should be considered that Bar ʿEbroyo’s claim is based on conjecture. There are no earlier sources that refer to his ecclesiastical affiliation, and the only surviving mss. of his works were produced in a Syr. Orth. milieu.</p>
<p>In his letter to ʿAlī b. Yaḥyā b. al-Munajjim about the translations of <ref type="cr">Galen</ref>’s work into Arabic, <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873) mentions Iyob as a translator of 36 of Galen’s works, mostly from Greek into Syriac. He probably translated works by <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref> and Ptolemy as well. Of his own works only two survive, the most important of which is the ‘Book of Treasures’ (<i>Ktāb</i><i>ā d-simātā</i>). It deals with a wide range of natural phenomena which Iyob analyzes according to his theory of the elements. It contains six discourses covering a wide-range of disciplines, such as anatomy, zoology, psychology, chemistry, metallurgy, meteorology, and astronomy. Iyob presents explanations for countless aspects of the natural world, with a distinct etiological focus and style that resembles the genre of <i>problemata physica</i>. He begins the work with his theory regarding the four simple and abstract essences, i.e. heat, cold, humidity and dryness, which, if found in individual compositions, constitute essences of a secondary kind. Iyob employs the fact that the primary essences are antagonistic as proof of the existence of God, whose act of creation consisted of bringing these elements together by force, as well as proof of the gradual disintegration of the world that leads to the end of times. The work contains a somewhat covert polemic against Islam, in that it culminates in a refutation of those who believe in an afterlife with physical pleasures. It also reveals Iyob’s acquaintance with contemporary Muʿtazilī thought. The work contains a strong resemblance to the pseudonymous Arabic work ‘The secret of creation’ (<i>Sirr al-khalīqa</i> or <i>Kitāb al-ʿilal</i>), attributed to Apollonius of Tyana (‘Balinus’), which was possibly written in the time of al-Maʾmūn as well, but the relationship between the two has not been thoroughly clarified. Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen are directly referenced in Iyob’s work. In addition, scholars claim to have found echoes of the Cappadocian Fathers, Theophrastus, Proclus, and Nemesius of Emesa. However, an in-depth study into Iyobs’s sources remains a desideratum.</p>
<p>Besides the ‘Book of Treasures’, only Iyob’s ‘On Rabies’ survives. The two extant works contain references to titles of some of his works now lost: ‘On Urine’, ‘On the causes of fevers’, ‘On the soul’, ‘On the causes of the coming into existence of the universe from the elements’, ‘On the five senses’, ‘On essences’, ‘On Faith’, and ‘Ten syllogisms taken from the nature of things, which prove that Christ is both God and man’. His work (possibly: works) ‘On Urine’ was known by several Arabic scientists in the centuries to follow, suggesting that it existed in Arabic as well, but it remains impossible to determine whether Iyob authored works in that language. Ullmann (<i>Die Medizin im Islam</i> [1970], 102) supposes that when Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Khwārizmī, Abū Bakr al-Rāzī and Muṭahhar al-Maqdisī cite Iyob, they are making use of Arabic translations of his Syriac works, while for example Kraus, Mingana, and Ḥabbī assume that Iyob wrote some of his works in Arabic.</p>

<p>Syriac scholar, professor at the University of Leiden, The Netherlands. After defending his Ph.D. dissertation (on the Hebrew text and ancient versions of Zechariah, ch. 9–14) in 1949, and spending an additional year of study in Leeds and Oxford, Jansma was appointed full professor of ‘Hebrew language and literature, Israelite Antiquities, and Aramaic’ at Leiden in 1950.

<LemmaTitle>Jerusalem</LemmaTitle> <ab type="infobox"/>Syr. <i>Oreshlem</i>, <i>Urishlem</i>
<p>As the birthplace of Christianity and the main destination of pilgrimage, Jerusalem played an important role for Christians of all Syr. traditions. At times, however, Syr. Christians had a somewhat ambivalent attitude towards the ‘earthly’ Jerusalem, to which the idea of the ‘heavenly’ Jerusalem or the eschatological city of Jerusalem often was contrasted as a more productive locus of theological or ascetic reflection.</p>
<p>Along with visitors and pilgrims from all over the Christian world, Syr. Christians started visiting Jerusalem or living there for some time no later than the 4th or early 5th cent. There is ample evidence of pilgrimages to Jerusalem throughout the centuries by both W. and E. Syrians.</p>
<p>At the Council of Chalcedon (451) Jerusalem became an independent patriarchate, but the Syr. Orth. Church and the Ch. of E., who either rejected or ignored this council, continued to see Jerusalem as being under the authority of the patriarchate of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. Efforts to associate the Christians of Jerusalem with the resistance to Chalcedon, in particular in the years when <ref type="cr">Severus</ref> resided as patr. in Antioch (512–518), were largely unsuccessful, and the majority of Christians in Jerusalem and Palestine accepted the Council of Chalcedon. The Syr. churches, therefore, only had a marginal presence in Jerusalem. Due to their non-acceptance of the Council of Chalcedon, Syr. bps. of Jerusalem did not have the patriarchal rank, even though in the later period (from the 16th cent. onwards) the title of patr. was occasionally used by Syr. Orth. bps. In general, bps. of Jerusalem, of both Syr. churches, were metropolitan bps. (even though, with very few exceptions, they did not have suffragan bps.).</p>
<p>For the Syr. Orth. Church, a list appended to the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> (App. IV) provides the names of bps. of Jerusalem. For the period until the early 6th cent., the names coincide with those of the bps. of the Imperial Church. For the period between ca. 500 and ca. 800 only a few names are preserved, and it is unclear whether we are dealing with the formal institution of a Jerusalem episcopacy. From the late 8th until the late 12th cent. Michael provides a continuous list of 25 Syr. Orth. bps. of Jerusalem, which is generally seen as reliable. For the subsequent period, from the 12th cent. until the present day, a list of all known bps. is available in Kiraz, 45–7.</p>
<p>For the Ch. of E., a metropolitan bp. ‘of Damascus, Jerusalem, and the coastal area’ is attested from the late 9th cent. onwards. Only a handful of names are known for the subsequent period and the institution disappeared in the modern period.</p>
<p>Several buildings are associated with the Syr. Orth. presence in Jerusalem: first, the Church of Mary Magdalene and Simon the Pharisee, i.e., where the episode recounted in Lk. 7:36–50 was situated (near Herod’s Gate; perhaps going back to the early 9th cent., later expanded with a monastery, and at the end of the 
12th cent. converted into the <i>Madrasat al-Qādisiyya</i>); second, the Church of Thomas, near the Armenian Monastery (attested from the 14th cent. onwards; it later became divided between the al-Yaʿqubī Mosque and the Anglican Cathedral); third, Dayr al-ʿAdas in Zion (which following the assassination of Bp. Gregorios Joseph IV in 1537 was turned into a mosque and later, in 1907, was converted into the Greek Orthodox Monastery of Nicodemus); and finally, the Church of the Mother of God, traditionally regarded as the house of the evangelist Mark, known as the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Mark</ref> (which may have come into Syr. Orth. possession around 1500) and still in Syr. Orth. possession today. In addition, the Syr. Orth. had a presence in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher (attested since the 12th cent.). Nowadays they use the Chapel of Nicodemus, although the rights are somewhat disputed. Syr. Orth. pilgrims left a number of Syr. <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref> at the entrance of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher (see Brock, Goldfus, and Kofsky).</p>
<p>As for the Ch. of E., in the 16th and 17th cent. there existed a church ‘of the Nestorians’ dedicated to St. Mary, situated to the north of the Holy Sepulcher. When the E.-Syr. presence in Jerusalem came to an end, in the 18th or possibly in the early 19th cent., the ms. collection belonging to this church passed into the hands of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate (see Chabot, Rücker, and Brock).</p>
<p>Outside of Jerusalem, there is evidence of Syr. Orth. presence in the medieval period in Tiberias, and from the 14th cent. onwards in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The presence of monks from the 
Ch. of E. is attested in a hermitage near Jericho (Fiey 1983, and Brock and Taylor, <i>Hidden Pearl</i>, vol. 2, 46) and possibly in a monastic complex at Tel Masos, in the northern Negev (Fritz and Maiberger).</p>
<p>Following the <ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref> a number of Syr. Orth. families settled in Jerusalem and Bethlehem, many of whom emigrated out of the area after the 1948 and 1976 Arab-
Israeli wars. Bp. <ref type="cr">Athanasios Yeshuʿ Samuel</ref> played an important role in the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. His autobiographical book on this subject contains much information on the Jerusalem community, in particular in the second quarter of the 20th cent. The present-day Syr. Orth bp. of Jerusalem has the title of ‘Patriarchal vicar of the Holy Land and Jordan’. Similarly, the Syr. Cath. and Chaldean Churches are represented in Jerusalem by patriarchal vicars, while the Maronite Church has a patriarchal exarch.</p>

<p>Monastic founder and author. John was born in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, the child of a rhetor and his mother, Aphtonia. He was a monk of the monastery of St. Thomas at Seleucia Pieria on the Orontes (near <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>) until he and other monks were driven out as a result of imperial persecution of non-Chalcedonian monasteries (ca. 530). The group chose John to be their Abbot and founded the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref> on the Euphrates, an establishment that came to produce many influential church leaders, scholars, and translators. John is remembered as having played a significant role in facilitating the transmission of Greek literary culture into a Syriac milieu. He participated in the Miaphysite negotiations with Justinian in Constantinople (ca. 531) before he died in 537. John wrote a biography of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref>, and a commentary on the Song of Songs, fragments of which survive in catenae. He is credited with having written a number of hymns in Greek that were added to collections associated with Severus and later translated into Syriac.</p>

<p>Bp. of Constantinople (398–404). Born in <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> in an affluent family, John studied under the renowned pagan rhetorician Libanius and was headed for a distinguished career in law or civil service until he fell under the influence of bp. Meletius. John was baptized in 368 and spent several years as part of an informal ascetic brotherhood that included <ref type="cr">Theodore</ref>, later bp. of Mopsuestia, who had been John’s fellow student under Libanius. In 381 Meletius ordained John as a deacon and in 386 Bp. Flavian made him a presbyter, at which time he became famous in Antioch for his skillful and plain-spoken preaching. Though Greek-speaking, from the pulpit he praised the unpretentious faith of the indigenous Aramaic-speaking Christians who lived in the countryside around the sophisticated Greco-Roman city. In 398 he was called to fill the vacant see of Constantinople. Once in the imperial capital, John’s moralistic preaching and strong character won him powerful enemies. Bp. Theophilus of Alexandria, who had consecrated John, resented the rejection of his own candidate and was jealous of Constantinople’s growing prestige. Many of the city’s clergy opposed John’s rigorous reforms. Theodosius’s empress Eudoxia was incensed at John’s relentless critique of the wealthy, and of her in particular. At the Synod of the Oak (403), Theophilus had John deposed, but popular support for John made it necessary to recall him. Nevertheless, he was deposed again in 404 and exiled to Cucusus in Armenia. He died on 14 Sept. in 407, while en route to the even more remote Pithyus on the Black Sea. In 438 his body was translated in great honor to Constantinople.</p>
<p>Though the connection between John and the Orthodox eucharistic liturgy bearing his name is disputable, he left behind a great many homilies, letters, treatises, and extensive cycles of exegetical homilies on scripture. His reputation and writings made him immensely popular. His eloquence earned him the posthumous surname ‘Chrysostom’ (‘Golden-mouth’); his tendency towards literal interpretation and his moralizing (rather than dogmatic) applications ensured that his works would be translated from Greek into various languages and circulated widely across confessional boundaries. John was being translated into Syriac by the late 5th cent. A  number of very early extant Syriac mss. contain portions of his works, primarily of W.-Syr. provenance, many of them earlier than extant Greek mss. Excerpts from his works appear in numerous W.-Syr. homiliaries, catenae, and other anthologies. His influence on the E.-Syr. tradition is obvious from the references in <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>’s ‘Catalogue’ (16; Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, 3.1.24–7) and the Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref> (1.67), and is also evident in the quotations occurring in the commentaries of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, the writings of <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref>, and the vast exegetical compilation, <ref type="cr">Gannat Bussāme</ref>. The oft-repeated assertion that <ref type="cr">Ḥenana</ref> was responsible for bringing John into prominence in the E.-Syr. church as an allegorizing competitor to Theodore of Mopsuestia is probably unfounded. Whatever Ḥenana’s influence may have been, John Chrysostom was a respected resource in the E.-Syr. tradition alongside his friend Theodore by the late 6th cent.</p>

<p>Greek philosopher and lay theologian. A native of Alexandria, he studied under the Neoplatonist philosopher Ammonius (of whose works he was an editor). The epithet <i>philoponos</i>, ‘lover of labour’, was probably given him in view of his industriousness. As a philosopher John has been described as one of the most original thinkers of his time, notable especially for his criticism of the prevailing Aristotelian doctrine of the eternity of the world. His writings prior to ca. 553 dealt with many different aspects of Aristotelian philosophy and survive only in Greek. It seems that it was the Council of Constantinople of 553 that led him to turn his attention to theology (<i>CPG</i> 7260–7274, and Supplement); most of this is known only in Syriac translation. This applies in particular to his main surviving theological work, the <i>Diaitētēs</i>, or ‘Arbiter’, on the Union (in the incarnate Christ). His <i>Tmemātā</i>, or ‘Sections’ against the Councils of Chalcedon (451) and Constantinople (553) are summarized in <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>’s Chronicle (VIII.13). His work on the Creation of the World, dating from ca. 557–60, extant in Greek, was written against the views of Cosmas Indicopleustes, the friend of Patr. <ref type="cr">Aba I</ref>. His later theological works are known only in excerpts or from hostile sources: this applies in particular to his ‘On the Trinity’, where his rigorous application of logic led him to speak of the oneness of the Trinity as an abstraction. This position, held by a number of theologians, was condemned as tritheism, generating a considerable polemical literature (among which is <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref>’s work ‘Against Damian’). John’s theological teaching was explicitly condemned at the Council of Constantinople in 680, but his philosophical works remained influential, first in Arabic translation, and then in 16th-cent. ­Western Europe in Latin.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>John Rufus
</LemmaTitle><p>Also known as John of Beth Ruphina and John of Maiuma. An anti-Chalcedonian presbyter, monk, and hagiographer of the 5th and 6th cent.; dates of birth and death unknown. He was probably born in the province of Arabia, and seems to have spent some time as a student of law at <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref> before his ordination as presbyter in <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> by Peter the Fuller about 475. During the confusion that followed upon Emperor Zeno’s expulsion of Peter the Fuller in 477, and the appointment of Calandion as new head of the church of Antioch, John found refuge in Ascalon where he became a monk under <ref type="cr">Peter the Iberian</ref>, the spiritual leader of the anti-Chalcedonian communities in Palestine. After the death of Peter in 491, John was entrusted with the service of the altar in the church of a newly built monastery at Maiuma, dedicated to the memory of Peter the Iberian. In the title of one of his works (Plerophories), he is styled ‘bishop of Maiuma at Gaza’.</p>
<p>From John Rufus three works have survived, originally composed in Greek but preserved solely in Syriac: the ‘Life of Peter the Iberian’, the ‘Commemoration of the Death of Theodosius’, and the ‘Plerophories’. The most important of these works is unquestionably the ‘Life of Peter the Iberian’, to which we owe much of our knowledge about the first generation of opposition to Chalcedon. The text has been anonymously preserved, but in 1912, Eduard Schwartz proved its proper attribution to John Rufus, mainly through an evaluation of internal evidences. The narrative, rhetorically and stylistically advanced, covers Peter the Iberian’s life from birth to death, but draws particular focus on the travels throughout the eastern provinces which Peter the Iberian undertook to provide spiritual support to those who refused Chalcedonian communion. The much less extensive ‘Commemoration of the Death of Theodosius’, written as an appendix to the ‘Life of Peter the Iberian’, deals with the martyrdom of Theodosius, the Palestinian monk who seized the Patriarchal throne in <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> from Juvenal immediately after Chalcedon. The Plerophories, finally, seems to have been composed during the patriarchate of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> (512–18) and consists of a collection of eighty-nine anecdotes about prophesies, visions, and other signs received by holy men against the council of Chalcedon. As a result of its harsh and relentless language and imagery, the Plerophories may be considered one of the most aggressive and eccentric instances of anti-Chalcedonian polemics.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Judaism, Syriac contacts with
</LemmaTitle><p>Syriac Christianity originated and developed in areas in which communities of Diaspora Judaism existed. Throughout their history Syr. Christians lived in proximity to Jews, both in the cities of Syria and in North and Central Mesopotamia, and they shared with Jews their language and much of their religious worldview. The interactions between Syr. Christians and Jews can be studied on three different levels: 1. the common religious and cultural heritage, and the influx of ideas from Judaism into Syr. Christianity, in particular in the early period; 2. the literary representations of Judaism within Syr. Christian literature, which are often of a polemical nature; 3. the more occasional and incidental comments on contacts and exchanges between Syr. Christians and Jews in daily life. While Jews and Judaism are frequently mentioned and discussed in Syr. sources, explicit references to Syr. Christians are almost completely lacking from Jewish sources. Whether and to what extent certain passages in Rabbinic literature were written in response to arguments brought forward by Syr. Christians remains a question of scholarly debate. Evidence of Jewish interest in Syr. Christianity is occasionally found in the Middle Ages, e.g., when R. Hai Gaon (939–1038) expresses interest in knowing the E.-Syr. Cath.’s view on an obscure phrase in Psalms, or when a Jewish redactor rewrites the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> of Proverbs into a Targum (Sokoloff, 404–5; Weitzman, 109–11). A more considered interest was found in the period of Humanism and Enlightenment, e.g., with <ref type="cr">A. de’ Rossi</ref> and, more sporadically, with B. de Spinoza (d. 1677).</p>
<p>The eastward spread of Christianity from Palestine must have affected the Jewish communities and the Semitic, largely Aramaic speaking, populations of Syria and Mesopotamia. Some of the earliest Christian preaching must have been done in Aramaic, even though there is very little evidence. At the same time, by the beginning of the Christian era, Hellenism and Greco-Roman culture had a strong presence throughout the Near East, and Greek soon became the primary language of Christianity. Not surprisingly, therefore, there has been an ongoing discussion among scholars as to whether the Jewish stream of ideas or the Greco-Roman one was more decisive in the birth and early development of Syr. Christianity. There is reason, however, to assume that Judaism was a determining factor in the origin and early development of Syr. Christianity, based on the fact (1) that Syr. Christians, probably in the late 2nd cent., received the OT Peshitta from Judaism (regardless of whether the translation from Hebrew was made prior to its being adopted as the Syr. Christian Bible, or was made by Syr. Christians with a Jewish background); 
(2) that early Syr. literature occasionally reflects non-biblical phraseology of the Jewish Targumim (e.g., Brock 1995); (3) and that early Syr. liturgy exhibits features of Jewish origin (Rouwhorst).</p>
<p>Somewhat related to this is the question of Syr. Christianity’s relationship to so-called Jewish Christianity, i.e., forms of Christianity represented by people who, mostly of Jewish origin themselves, continued to identify as Jews and remained faithful to Jewish customs and rituals (such as circumcision and food laws). As evidence for the existence of Jewish Christians in Syria, one may point to the <ref type="cr">Didascalia Apostolorum</ref> (3rd cent.), which most likely was written in Syria and which in some sections clearly reflects a Christian community that was composed of both Gentiles and Jews (who had to be discouraged from identifying too closely with non-Christian Judaism). This text, however, was written in Greek and may not be representative of the situation in the heartlands of Syr. Christianity; on the other hand, the text’s reception and popularity in Syriac, most likely from the 5th cent. onwards, indicates that its content was seen as relevant to Syr. Christianity. The Pseudo-Clementine writings (see <ref type="cr">Clement of Rome</ref>) also reflect Jewish understandings of Christianity (see most recently Reed). Written in Greek, probably in the 3rd cent., these texts were translated into Syriac and parts were included in the earliest dated Syr. ms. (Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150, dated 411).</p>
<p>Recent scholarship has pointed out that in the early Christian period the boundaries between Jewish and Christian communities were far from watertight and allowed for a rather fluid pattern of religious identification. This situation of porous borders may have lasted longer in Aramaic-speaking areas than in the Greco-Roman world; it also may have had a longer history in the Sasanian Empire, where the 4th-cent. Christianization of the Roman Empire had little immediate effect (Becker 2003). In such a situation the interrelationship between Jews and Christians may have been more complex than it was in the Christianized Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Regardless of how strong a presence Jewish Christianity had in the early period, Syr. Christianity from the 4th cent. onwards saw itself as breaking away from Judaism. The two main 4th-cent. authors, <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref> and <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, convey mixed messages. On the one hand, a number of themes and ideas of Jewish origin are found in their works and suppose an audience that, at least in part, was well acquainted with Judaism. On the other hand, this common ground with Judaism did not prevent these authors from expressing distance from and rejection of Judaism, including contemporary Judaism. Just as in Greek Christian literature, Judaism was defined increasingly as the opposite of Christianity. The writings of Aphrahaṭ and Ephrem may be read perhaps as reflecting a situation which was still characterized by ongoing communality between Jews and Christians, but in which these very authors were intent on drawing clearer boundaries and creating separation. Anti-Jewish sentiment, which had been largely absent from early Syr. literature, became a factor in the process of Christian self-identification. It may also be telling that it is mainly Aphrahaṭ’s second series of Demonstrations (nos.  11–22), dated to 344, that contains anti-Jewish polemic, while the earlier series (Dem. 1–10, dated to 337) is relatively free from it. In 344, well into the Roman-Persian war and the predicament of persecution, Christians may have needed a more powerful warning that they should not choose the easy solution of retreating to the relative safety of Judaism.</p>
<p>Aphrahaṭ and Ephrem, writing in the Persian-Sasanian Empire and in the Roman Empire respectively, share a number of themes and arguments in their dealings with Judaism, but their tone is very different. To account for Ephrem’s harsh language about Jews (which may have targeted Judaizing Christians rather than Jews themselves), scholars have pointed to Ephrem’s and his community’s own profound Jewishness (Cassingena: ‘«judéité» fondatrice’), which would have contributed to Ephrem’s particular sensitivity. But the general profile of Aphrahaṭ’s community cannot have been much different, and yet his approach is so much milder. Should we ascribe the difference between Aphrahaṭ and Ephrem to ‘personal temperament and inclination’ (Hayman 1985, 427)? Or should the social and political context be taken into consideration? In the Persian-Sasanian Empire, in which Aphrahaṭ wrote, both Judaism and Christianity were minorities in the Zoroastrian society. In the Roman Empire, however, Syr. Christianity soon became part of the emerging imperial orthodoxy, which in Ephrem’s day was in the process of asserting itself, although it still was fragile (as the short reign of Emperor Julian showed) and weakened by internal division. Might this difference have contributed to setting a different tone for Aphrahaṭ, on the one hand, and for Ephrem, on the other? But even within the corpus of Ephrem’s writings the degree of anti-Jewish polemic differs widely: the Commentary on Genesis (a work with many ‘Jewish’ features) and the Prose Refutations (dealing with different ‘heretical’ doctrines) have very little anti-Jewish polemic; the anti-Judaism of the Commentary on the Diatessaron reflects the language of theological debate (Morrison); and some of the Hymns are passionately anti-Jewish.</p>
<p>Anti-Jewish literature continued in Syr. Christianity, without ever becoming as prominent as it was in Greek or Latin Christianity. And again, marked differences are found, such as between <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>’s harshness and his contemporary <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>’s mildness (Frishman). Here again, one author is writing within the Roman Empire and the other as a member of a minority group in the Persian-Sasanian Empire. In addition, these authors belong to different theological traditions, which may have had a different impact on their approach to Judaism. As dyophysite Christology and Antiochene biblical interpretation were often portrayed by opponents as being (nearly) identical to Judaism, the use of anti-Jewish argument may have become, for those of the Antiochene tradition, less attractive.</p>
<p>From the mid-8th cent., when both Jews and Syr. Christians had become minority groups under the dominance of Islam, a report is preserved of a disputation that was held in the region of <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref>between <ref type="cr">Sargis the Stylite</ref> (it is unclear whether he was a Miaphysite or a Chalcedonian) and a Jew (ed. Hayman). While the text contains a number of stock arguments of anti-Jewish polemic, there also is a remarkable passage in which the Jewish interlocutor mentions those Christians ‘who associate with us in the synagogue, and who bring offerings and alms and oil, and at the time of the Passover send unleavened bread …’ (22.1, ed. Hayman, 72; transl. 73–74). Sargis is unable to challenge this description, but portrays these people as ‘sick and weak’, not able to walk on the king’s highway. Once again we seem to be confronted with porous borders, which allow for multiple religious identifications.</p>
<p>In addition to occasionally targeting the Jews in their theological polemic, Syr. Christians also had a genuine interest in Judaism. Their main source for post-biblical Jewish history was <ref type="cr">Josephus</ref>’s ‘Jewish War’. While a Syr. translation is preserved only of the Sixth Book, quotations from other books in Sargis the Stylite’s ‘Disputation’ and elsewhere (in a Miaphysite florilegium, possibly of the 6th cent., preserved in ms. Dayr al-Suryān 28, and in <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>’s Treatise against the Jews) suggest that a full translation once existed. This work was used for purposes well beyond that of polemic. <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> had a keen interest in Jewish writings, such as the ‘Book of Enoch’ and ‘Jewish Histories’ (<i>tašʿyātā yudāyātā</i>, a work related to ‘Jubilees’), whose authenticity and usefulness he defended, even against more negative views in the earlier tradition (Adler). He was also familiar with certain Jewish traditions, such as the pronunciation and writing of the Tetragrammaton, and he was aware of the importance of the Hebrew language, of which he had some, albeit rather limited knowledge (see Salvesen). Cath. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> as well relied on Jews, who in some cases were converts, for information about the Bible. 
A common practice in biblical commentaries is the quotation of alternative readings from the ‘Hebrew (Bible)’ (along with those from the Septuagint), which either agree with the Masoretic text or, more often, reflect later Jewish interpretations (see, e.g., Ter Haar Romeny 2001). Interest in Jewish sects is found in several Syr. authors, the latest of whom is Dionysios bar Ṣalibi (Brock 1977). In his ‘Treatise against the Jews’, probably the last such work to be written in Syriac, he included an overview of Jewish sects, largely based on <ref type="cr">Epiphanius of Salamis</ref>’s <i>Anakephalaiosis</i>, expanded with information taken from Josephus’ ‘Jewish War’ (Book II,160–6). <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s 
attitude towards Judaism is largely irenic. While until recently it was assumed that he was of Jewish descent (‘Son of the Hebrew’, his father being the physician Ahrun), most scholars have now abandoned this view, linking his name instead to the village of ʿEbro, on the Euphrates. There is very little evidence of conversion from Judaism to Syr. Christianity in the Islamic period and, more generally, contacts between Jews and Christians are very poorly documented. Canonical collections include rules urging Christians to work on the Jewish Sabbath, prohibiting bishops and clergy from celebrating Jewish festivals, and warning Christians not to accept unleavened bread from Jews (Kawerau 94). Here again we may be dealing with attempts by the church leadership to create a separation that did not always exist in daily life.</p>
<p>For the later period, we have an interesting example of the co-existence of Jews and E.-Syr. Christians in Iraqi Kurdistan. From the early 17th cent. onwards, bene­fitting from improved living conditions, both Jews and Christians started writing down their vernacular Neo-Aramaic languages, which were closely related and mutually understandable. Borrowing the script from their respective authoritative traditions (Hebrew and Jewish Aramaic for the Jews and Syriac for the Christians), they proceeded in very similar ways, turning in the first place to liturgical or para-liturgical texts. This ‘areal phenomenon’, involving both Jewish and Christian communities (A. Mengozzi, <i>Israel of Alqosh and Joseph of Telkepe</i> [CSCO 590; 2002], 16), seems to presuppose a rather unproblematic relationship between the two religious communities. As a matter of fact, Aramaic-speaking Jews and Christians lived together peacefully in Iraqi Kurdistan until around 1950, and in Iran even later. Among the villages and towns in which Jews and Christians lived in close proximity to each other, the following deserve to be singled out: <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref>, where Jews and Christians went on pilgrimage to the tomb of the prophet Nahum (Fiey, <i>Assyrie chrétienne</i>, vol. 2, 396–400); Zakho (see most recently A. Sabar, <i>My father’s paradise</i> [2009]); and Shosh (ancient Bashosh; see Fiey, <i>Assyrie chré</i><i>tienne</i>, vol. 1, 259). An E.-Syr. ms., Brit. Libr. Add. 25,875, dated 1709/10 (Wright, <i>Catalogue</i>, vol. 3, 1064–69) contains a Hebrew alphabet and some additional writing in Hebrew, including a part of Ps. 22 in Hebrew script, even though the text is Syriac. In the 20th cent., however, the political situation in the Middle East added a new layer of tension to the relationship between Jews and Syr. Christians.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</Author><LemmaTitle>Julian of Halicarnassus</head><ab type="infobox"/>(fl. ca. 520) [Syr. Orth.]
<p>Bp., theologian, controversialist. In 511 Julian, bp. of Halicarnassus, sided with <ref type="cr">Severus</ref>, future bp. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, to successfully depose Patr. Macedonius of Constantinople. Seven years later, due to the anti-Miaphysite policies of the emperor Justinian, Julian and Severus were both exiles in Egypt. Here Julian offended Severus by claiming that his belief in the incorruptibility of Christ’s body was inspired by Severus’s own work, the Philalethes. The resulting epistolary exchange between these former allies soon escalated into multiple polemical tractates and finally a significant schism among the Miaphysites that lasted for centuries.</p>
<p>Julian’s three letters to Severus as well as nearly all of Severus’s anti-Julian writings are extant in a Syriac translation that <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Kallinikos</ref> made in 528. We also possess 154 fragments attributed to Julian, also preserved mostly in Syriac. Although these works shed little light on Julian’s life, they do allow us to reconstruct much of his theology.</p>
<p>Central to Julian and Severus’s dispute was the question of how to properly characterize Christ’s body. Although both agreed that after the resurrection Christ’s body was incorruptible, Julian declared Christ’s pre-resurrection body to be uncorrupted (<i>aphthartos</i>) as well. According to Julian, unlike the post-lapsian human body, Christ’s body would not naturally undergo changes such as sleep or death. It was only through Christ’s will that he voluntarily subjected himself to human suffering. For Julian this both reinforced Christ’s single nature and, by distinguishing Christ’s body from human bodies, assured that Christ was immune from the transmission of sin. Severus argued that if Christ had not participated fully in human nature, he could not have saved humanity. Severus thus saw Julian’s theology as a direct challenge to Christ’s role in salvation, and he characterized Julian as a follower of <ref type="cr">Eutyches</ref>, Mani, and the early docetists, calling his theology ‘aphthartodocetism’.</p>
<p>By the end of the 520s Julian and Severus no longer wrote treatises against each other, but by this time there already was a substantial Miaphysite rift between pro- and anti-Julianists. The Alexandrian Patr. Timothy  IV seems to have had pro-Julianist leanings, and after his death the pro-Julianist Gaianus was Patr. for three months. Although Justinian soon replaced him with the Severian <ref type="cr">Theodosius</ref>, Gaianus continued to enjoy popular support. Throughout much of 6th-cent. Egypt there were competing Severian and Julianist/Gaianite hierarchies and occasionally dual Patrs. The controversy soon spread outside of Egypt into Syria and Asia Minor and in 564 or 565 Justinian himself wrote an edict on the incorruptibility of Christ’s body. 7th- and 8th-cent. sources continue to attest to Julianists throughout the East. Of particular note is the aphrthartodocetic leanings of <ref type="cr">Armenian Christianity</ref>. A case for Julian’s influence on Armenian christology is difficult to substantiate, however, as none of Julian’s works are extant in Armenian. Unfortunately, most of the later anti-Julianist writings remain unedited and there has been relatively little work done on the development of this movement and its eventual demise.</p>

<Author>M. P. Penn</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Julian Romance</LemmaTitle> 
<p>The so-called Julian Romance is a Syriac polemical work against the Roman emperor Julian. The principal witness to this text is ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,641, which can be dated paleographically to the 6th cent. (with the exception of 23 folios that are from the 10th–12th  cent.). Approximately twelve folios are missing from the beginning of this ms. The initial section of the narrative is, however, partially preserved as the lower writing in the palimpsest ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 378. An abridged Arabic translation is also found in ms. Arabic 516 at the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref> with two additional leaves in the Mingana collection. In 1880, Hoffmann published the Syriac text of the Julian Romance according to the British Library ms. Excerpts were also published by Bedjan (independent of Hoffmann) and Gottheil (dependent on Hoffmann). The only complete translation of the text is the rather infelicitous one by Gollancz into English, of which an abridgment into French was made by Richer.</p>
<p>The Julian Romance consists of three parts. The first, which is incomplete, recounts Julian’s accession to the throne after Constantine and the resulting persecution of the Christians. The second is a narrative about Eusebius, the bp. of Rome, who facing persecution opposed Julian. The third and longest section is framed as a letter by Aploris to Abdil that describes the reign of Jovian (Syriac <i>ywbnynws</i>‘Jovinian’). In 1874, Nöldeke argued that all three parts of the Julian Romance were composed by the same unknown author. He also contended that the Romance was an original Syriac composition written in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> between 502–532. Nöldeke’s position was adopted in the standard handbooks, such as Baumstark’s <i>Geschichte der syrischen Literatur</i> and Ortiz de Urbina’s <i>Patrologia Syriaca</i>, and continues to be favored by some scholars today, such as Papoutsakis. There are, however, several other views. Van Esbroeck proposed that the Romance was originally written in Greek sometime after 363 and was then translated into Syriac at the beginning of the 6th cent. H. J. W. Drijvers, on the other hand, argued that the Romance is a propaganda tract originally written in Syriac in Edessa shortly after 379. Finally, both Brock and Contini have more recently suggested that the Romance was written in Edessa, but in the 5th cent., not the 6th.</p>
<p>The Julian Romance draws significantly on the ideas and phraseology of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> and also shares stylistic similarities with the writings of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>. Despite the fact that it is primarily known from a single Syriac ms., it has influenced a number of later writings. In the Syriac tradition, for instance, the Romance was a source for apocalyptic literature, such as the <ref type="cr">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</ref><i>.</i>Furthermore, the Julian Romance in its Arabic manifestation informed accounts of Julian by Arabic historians, such as al-Ṭabarī. It also exerted some influence on both Greek and Georgian literature.</p>
<p>Finally, mention should be made of a ‘second’ Julian Romance that is preserved in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Rich Add. 7192, which can be dated paleographically to the 7th or 8th cent. This text was also published by Hoffmann (1880, 242–50) and was translated into German by Nöldeke (1874, 660–74) and into English by Gollancz (1928, 256–64), the latter of which was abridged by Richer (1978, 263–8). This ‘second’ Julian Romance, which is much shorter than the ‘first’, describes the apostasy of Julian and his magic practices. Based on stylistic differences with the ‘first’ Julian Romance, Nöldeke argued that the ‘second’ Julian Romance was most likely written by a different author later in the 6th cent. More recently, Muraviev has argued that it is actually part of the original Julian Romance belonging to the missing initial section.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Juridical literature</LemmaTitle>
<p>Juridical texts transmitted within the Syr. Christian traditions are of very diverse content and nature. In addition to texts dealing with canon law, church administration, and discipline, a number of texts deal with private law and secular matters. The reason for the latter concern is that the churches in both the Zoroastrian and Islamic societies were in charge of private law, and, therefore, created handbooks and reference works, particularly in the fields of matrimonial and hereditary law. The earliest layer of juridical literature consists of translations from Greek; indigenous Syriac material was subsequently added to this in both the W.- and E.-Syr. traditions.</p>
<label type="subsection">1. Late Roman Law in Syriac Tradition</label>
<p>The Syro-Roman Lawbook (ed. Selb and Kaufhold) is a collection of interpretations of mostly 5th-cent. imperial constitutions dealing with civil law. It probably originated in a law school in Syria, even though the Lawbook’s relationship to the academic teaching of law in the schools of <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref> and Constantinople has been questioned (Goria). We may be dealing with a 6th-cent. Syr. translation of a Greek Vorlage that no longer exists. The Syro-Roman Lawbook, therefore, is of crucial importance both for the study of late ancient Roman law and for its reception within the Syr. Christian milieu. The work underwent several revisions and found its way into W.-Syr. juridical collections from the 8th or 9th cent. onwards. It also became known in the Ch. of the E. no later than ca. 800 (Cath. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> being our earliest witness). Later Arabic and Armenian versions are based on the Syr.</p>
<p>A much smaller collection, named by its editor (Selb) ‘Sententiae Syriacae’, reflects a similar late Roman imperial context and the practice of a law school. Here again the Greek Vorlage is no longer extant.</p>
<label type="subsection">2. Civil Law</label>
<p>Matrimonial law and hereditary law take an important place in a number of early E.-Syr. lawbooks, attributed to cath. Mar <ref type="cr">Aba I</ref> (d. 552), to <ref type="cr">Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir</ref> (probably 7th cent.), and to <ref type="cr">Ishoʿbokht of Rev Ardashir</ref> (late 8th cent.?). These lawbooks reflect a Persian Zoroastrian context; the latter two were originally written in Persian and subsequently translated into Syriac. E.-Syr. works from the early Islamic period include the juridical decisions of cath. <ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ I</ref> (late 7th cent.), and short lawbooks by cath. Timotheos I (d. 823), <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> 
(d. 828), <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar</ref> <ref type="cr">Bahrīz</ref> (early 9th cent.), and <ref type="cr">Gewargis of Arbela</ref> (late 10th cent.). Specifically aimed at collecting and preserving earlier materials are works attributed to Cath. <ref type="cr">Eliya I</ref> (d. 1049) and to <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (bar Shinaya, d. 1046). While the lawbooks of Aba  I, Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir, Ishoʿbokht, Ḥenanishoʿ I, Timotheos I, and Ishoʿ bar Nun are included in E. Sachau’s <i>Syrische 
Rechtsbücher</i> (1907–14), and the one by ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz was edited by W. Selb (1970), the lawbooks of Gewargis of Arbela and cath. Eliya I, both contained in the large collection of E. Syr. juridical texts (see <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>), remain unpublished. Eliya of Nisibis’s lawbook only exists in Arabic. A remarkable juridical collection, known as ‘Syriac texts on Islamic Law’ (ed. Kaufhold 1971), fully incorporates Islamic law. It exists in the 
E. and W.-Syr. tradition as well as in an Arabic translation. While it is sometimes attributed to cath. <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Abgare</ref> (ca. 900), its authorship remains uncertain.</p>
<label type="subsection">3. Ecclesiastical Law</label>
<p>The common foundation of the tradition of ecclesiastical law in all Syrian (and other Eastern Christian) churches has two major components, both originally written in Greek. The first is the ‘Corpus canonum’, i.e., a collection of canons of the 4th-cent. councils, including the ecumenical councils of Nicea (325) and Constantinople (381) along with a number of local synods (Ancyra, Neocaesarea, Gangra, <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, and Laodicea). The second consists of several collections of canons attributed to the apostles or their immediate successors. This common foundation was expanded with other texts, some of Greek, others of Syriac origin.</p>
<p>In the W.-Syr. tradition, the ‘Corpus canonum’ (the earliest Syr. translation of which was produced in Mabbug in 501/2) gradually underwent a number of expansions. These included: one or two of the 5th-cent. councils; some apostolic texts (such as the ‘Apostolic canons’, an extract from Book 8 of the ‘Apostolic constitutions’); some texts of Miaphysite origin (probably translated from Greek); and indigenous Syriac rules by such authors as <ref type="cr">Rabbula of Edessa</ref>and <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Tella</ref>(bar Qursos). This corpus was revised and further expanded by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>. Around this period, in all likelihood, the ‘<ref type="cr">Didascalia Apostolorum</ref>’ began to appear in the juridical collections. One particular ms. (Dam. 8/11), belonging to a slightly later period (dated 1204), incorporates a number of further additions, esp. the canons (mostly of disciplinary content) of seven Syr. Orth. synods held between 785 and 896 (ed. of the entire ms. Vööbus 1975–76). This tradition of ecclesiastical law eventually merged with civil law in <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s ‘Nomocanon’ (see sub 4).</p>
<p>In the E.-Syr. tradition, the acts and canons of synods between 410 and 776 are preserved in the Synodicon Orientale (ed. Chabot). The canons of two additional synods (790 and 1318) are preserved as well. The canons of the 4th-cent. Greek councils became known to the E. Syr. in the early 5th cent., as is reflected in the Synodicon Orientale. The existing canons attributed to the Council of Nicea (325), however, appear to be a later collection of 73 (pseudo-Nicene) canons (ed. Vööbus 1982; GT in Braun 1898). The ‘Apostolic canons’ are included in the E.-Syr. tradition as well. Our main source for the E. Syr. juridical tradition is a large collection of texts that probably was constituted in the 13th cent. (see Synodicon Orientale); not unlike Bar ʿEbroyo’s ‘Nomocanon’ this included both ecclesiastical law and civil law. But whereas Bar ʿEbroyo’s editorial work introduced an important unifying dimension to the work, no such deliberate policy of unification and classification seems to underlie the E.-Syr. collection (Kaufhold 2005, 231).</p>
<label type="subsection">4. Systematic Collections</label>
<p>Systematic collections in which civil law and ecclesiastical law are deliberately brought together can be traced back to a much earlier period than the 13th cent. Such works have sometimes been called ‘Nomocanones’ (reflecting the title of somewhat similar Greek collections containing secular <i>nomoi</i>‘laws’ and ecclesiastical ‘canons’). The earliest collection of this comprehensive type is the one that is (partly) preserved under the name of <ref type="cr">Gabriel of Baṣra</ref>(late 9th cent.). In the E.-Syr. tradition two further systematic collections of this type are preserved, both by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>: his ‘Nomocanon’ (<i>Kunnāšā d-qānone sunhādiqāye</i>, ed. A. Mai) and his ‘Ordo iudiciorum’ (<i>Tukkās</i> <i>dine ʿedtānāye</i>, LT by J. M. Vosté; for both works, see Kaufhold 2005, 231–5). In the W.-Syr. tradition, Bar ʿEbroyo’s ‘Nomocanon’ (<i>Kthobo d-hudoye</i> ‘Book of directions’, ed. P. Bedjan) belongs to the same genre. Chapters 1–8 contain ecclesiastical law (also including matrimonial law); chapters 9–40 deal with civil law (Kaufhold 2005, 219–20). Syriac ‘Nomocanons’ are reflected in some of the Arabic collections, such as <ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref>’s <i>Fiqh al-Naṣrāniyya</i>.</p>
<p>The large collections in which the E-. and W.-Syr. juridical traditions reached their fullest development, those of ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha and Bar ʿEbroyo, have remained authoritative to the present day, in the Ch. of E. and in the Syr. Orth. Church respectively (Kaufhold 2005, 220–21 and 235; 2007, 242–3 and 247).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Kaftun, Dayr 
</LemmaTitle><p>Greek Orthodox monastery in Lebanon, known as Dayr Saydat Kaftun (Monastery of Our Lady of Kaftun) and located in the valley of the Nahr al-Jaouz near Kaftun, to the south of <ref type="cr">Amyūn</ref>. The modern building is erected on ancient substructures to the north of the Church of Sts. Sergius and Bacchus. Reconstruction in 2003 resulted in the discovery of wall paintings. These have been restored by the Polish Center for Mediterranean Archaeology in Cairo in collaboration with the Lebanese Direction Générale des Antiquités.</p>
<p>The basilical church consists of a nave with an apse and two aisles. The sidewalls of the nave are broken up by two huge arches resting on piers. Later additions include a vestibule, a porch, and a barrel vault. The preserved paintings have been attributed to two artists working side by side, very likely in the 2nd or 3rd quarter of the 
13th cent. The first master decorated the north and south walls with the Communion of the Apostles, divided into two separate scenes. On the north wall survive the bust of an archangel in a medallion, a Greek inscription near a now vanished saint (Domatius?), and St. Lawrence with an angel. Above this zone, fragments indicate that the walls were originally considerably higher. The second artist painted the Deisis Vision in the conch of the apse, the Annunciation on the triumphal arch, Sts. Bacchus, Sergius, George, and Theodore on the soffits of the westernmost arches, and four monastic saints on the soffits of the easternmost arches, among whom are Sts. Arsenius and Saba. Stylistically, the first master worked in the Byzantine tradition; the style of the second betrays a combination of Syrian, Byzantine, and Cypriot influences. The names of the saints are written in either Greek or Syriac. A red-bordered white frieze runs over the present upper zone, bearing a now fragmented Arabic inscription running over all walls. Part of it can be translated as: ‘[Anta]kya and the entire East’, suggesting that the text perhaps included the name of the Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> of that time, though this title was shared by the leaders of the Byz. Orth., the Syr. Orth., and the Maronite churches.</p>
<p>The stylistic characteristics of the paintings are echoed in a contemporary double-sided icon kept in the chapel of the monastery, showing the Virgin holding the Child (obverse) and the Baptism of Christ (reverse). Iconographic and stylistic analogies with several icons in the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref> on Mount Sinai show that these pieces, too, can be attributed to the same workshop or, more precisely, to the second master. The most important piece is a bilateral icon representing the Virgin with the Child (obverse) and St. Sergius as a banner-carrier with St. Bacchus (reverse), which until recently was considered a Crusader work of art.</p>
<p>Dayr Kaftun is mentioned in a note in a Maronite ms. dated 1140/41 (A.G. 1452). In a much discussed note added on f. 6v of the <ref type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref>, the Maronite Patr. Jeremiah of Dmalsa, mentions that in Febr. 1279 (A.G. 1590), he was consecrated as bp. of the ‘Holy Monastery of Kaftun constructed on the bank of the river’, where he subsequently stayed for four years, before he became Patr. (Borbone, 39–40 for the text; and 56–8 for a discussion of the chronological problems involved). Confusingly, the monastery is also referred to in two Melkite Syriac texts. A ms. from 1248 (A.G. 1559) mentions the ‘Monastery of the Mother of God near the River of Kaftun’. The monk Gerasimus b. Simaʿan, originating from al-Rummana near <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>, repeats this formulation in his writing from 1283/84 (A.G. 1595), which also furnishes the name of Aba Simaʿan b. Jaqir (bp. Simeon son of Jaqir), ‘the first superior of this holy monastery’. In later sources, the monastery features only as a Melkite retreat.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The collection of animal and other stories, generally known under this title (the names of the two protagonists), has enjoyed enormous popularity in the Middle East and subsequently in Western Europe, translated into many different languages. The tales are of Indian origin, and some, derived from a lost Sanskrit original, are to be found in the Pancatantra. In the 6th cent. a translation into Middle Persian was made by Burzoy (Barzaway), a physician at the court of Khusrau I (531–79); this no longer survives, but it was soon translated into Syriac by Bodh, whose translation (edited first by G. Bickell, 1876) is the earliest witness to the cycle of stories in the Middle East. Later on, in the first half of the 9th cent. the Middle Persian text was translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ; this too is lost in its original form, but it was the ancestor of all the subsequent forms of the collection, whether in Arabic or in later translations into Syriac, Persian, Greek, Hebrew, and Spanish; from these, yet further translations were made into Western European languages (sometimes under the name ‘Bidpay’ or ‘Pilpay’), as well as into Turkish. Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ’s translation included an autobiography by Burzoy, and an account of his journey to India, sent by Khusrau I. The autobiography is absent from the 6th-cent. Syriac translation, but is to be found at the end of the later Syriac version, made from Arabic; this was perhaps produced in the 10th or 11th cent., by which time the text had been considerably expanded: whereas the older Syriac text contains 10 stories, the later one has 14. A second Syriac translation based on the Arabic was made in the 19th century by the great scholar <ref type="cr">Toma Audo</ref>; this has 15 stories, and lacks the narrative of Burzoy.</p>

Syriac sources call it <i>Karamles</i>, <i>Karamleš</i>, and <i>Garmeš</i>, renderings of the ancient Assyrian toponym <i>Kar-Mulissu</i>,‘The quarter of Mulissu’, the latter being the consort of the god Ashur. The Assyrian name is inscribed on bricks uncovered in the archaeological tell near the city, which must contain the temple of the Assyrian goddess. The top of the tell is now occupied by the church of the martyr Barbara and her sister Juliana dated to the Mongol period if not earlier. During this period, the E.-Syr. Patr. Denḥa II resided in Karamlish for a few years, and it was the home of several emirs working for the Mongols, as mentioned in the Ecclesiastical History of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>. At that time, Karamlish was inhabited by E.-Syr., Syr. Orth., and Armenian families in sizable numbers. During the 18th cent., it suffered the onslaught of the army of the Persian Nādir Shāh on his way to invade Mosul. Its churches were badly destroyed and the inscriptions found there commemorate their rebuilding after 1743. During the 19th cent., Karamlish joined the uniate movement, becoming Chald. The community speaks <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref> and owns four churches dedicated to St. Barbara, St. George, the Virgin Mary, and

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Khamis bar Qardaḥe</head><ab type="infobox"/>[Ch. of E.] (13th cent.?) 
<p>E. Syr. poet, possibly priest in or near <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>, Khamis appears to have been a younger contemporary of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, to whose poem ‘On Divine Wisdom’ (<i>memrā zawgānā</i><i>yā</i>‘couple, doubled or rhymed <i>memrā</i>’) Khamis added a couplet for each distich. Other later poets, as Ishoʿyahb bar Mqadam and <ref type="cr">Yawsep II</ref>, continued to add verses to this poem. Like <ref type="cr">Gewargis Warda</ref>, who was probably his contemporary, Khamis is not included in the ‘Catalogue’ of <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>. Only a few specimens of the vast poetic production which was included under his name have been published.</p>
<p>Various collections of <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>onyāthā</i> (sing. <ref type="cr">ʿ</ref><ref type="cr">onithā</ref>) attributed to Khamis are preserved in mss. from the 14th to the 19th cent., often in combination with <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>onyāthā</i> attributed to Gewargis Warda or other hymnographers. They are penitential hymns, hymns for various feasts of the liturgical year, and martyrological hymns in praise of Ishoʿsabran (see <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref>of<ref type="cr"> Adiabene</ref>). Some collections contain poems on rather profane themes: satire on the ignorance of the people in Arbela, polemical attack on an apostate deacon, allegorical and pedagogical matters (e.g. on the silk-worm, <i>memrā</i> of the letters of the alphabet), and more than two hundred epigrams (<i>tarʿe d-mušḥāthā</i>) on various subjects (religion, wisdom, love, every-day objects, and flowers). The latter were much appreciated by Baumstark who presented them as most vivid examples of the poetic skill of the author.</p>
<p><i>Turgāme</i> by Khamis (poetic commentaries on the Gospel, usually composed in rhymed couplets of twelve-syllable lines) are transmitted together with works by ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha belonging to the same genre, which has a liturgical function comparable to that of the Latin sequence. The attribution to Khamis of a number of religious or profane <i>soghyāthā</i> (see <ref type="cr">poetry</ref>) is particularly uncertain.</p>

<p>Prelate of the Syriac Catholic Church and founder and director of the periodical <i>L’Orient Syrien</i>. Gabriel Khouri-Sarkis was born on 27 Febr. 1898 in the Christian village of Qatana, Syria, into a devout Syriac Catholic family. The family name ‘Sarkis’, hyphenated ‘Khouri’ (Arabic ‘priest’) is testimony to the fact that the family boasted a long line of priests. In 1908, he entered the Séminaire Oriental in <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>, Lebanon where, under the direction of the French Jesuits attached to the Université Saint Joseph, young seminarians drawn from all the eastern churches received their primary education. He continued his studies at the Syriac Catholic Patriarchal Seminary at <ref type="cr">Sharfeh</ref>, where he became acquainted with the scholarship of the eminent churchman and scholar, His Beatitude <ref type="cr">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref> (1848–1929), which was a formative influence on his life. Ordained a priest on 4 July 1920, Father Gabriel began a life-long collaboration with the then Syriac Catholic Archbishop of <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>, <ref type="cr">Gabriel Tappuni</ref> (1879–1968). Father Gabriel’s appointment to various diplomatic missions in Europe and the USA on behalf of the Syriac Catholic Patriarchate expanded his vision of the needs of the Syriac Church beyond the lands of its origin. Always a priest first, pastoral service dominated Father Gabriel’s life. In 1922 he founded St. Ephrem Parish in Paris to serve the pastoral needs of Middle-Eastern Christians of all denominations. He also served as chaplain at Clinique Sainte-Marie (Vernon).</p>
<p>In 1931, Father Gabriel was named representative of the Patriarchate in Paris and was elevated to the rank of ‘Chor-episcopus’, a title usually rendered in English as ‘Chor-Bishop’. In 1950 Chor-Bishop Gabriel was decorated with the Cross of the Legion of Honor, Le Chevalier, by the French government for his dedication to France during the resistance.</p>
<p>As a result of his travels throughout Europe and the USA on behalf of the Patriarchate, Chor-Bishop Gabriel became aware of the wide-spread lack of knowledge of Syriac Christianity in the West. In 1955, with the support and encouragement of Jesuit and Benedictine scholars in Europe, he founded <i>L’Orient Syrien</i>, a scholarly journal of information about Syriac Christianity geared to the interested non-specialist. The fledgling journal achieved world-wide distribution and featured studies by eminent Syriac scholars. In the course of twelve years (1956–1967) 48 issues of the journal were published.</p>
<p>A dedicated and beloved priest, ecumenist, and scholar, Chor-Bishop Gabriel died on 20 April 1968. A memorial volume, for which the initiative had been taken by <ref type="cr">François Graffin</ref>, appeared in 1969.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Also known as Veh-Ardashir or New Seleucia. Located on the Tigris, south of modern <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>, the name Kokhe is Aramaic in origin. Kokhe was established as a round city to the east of Old Seleucia and until recently was believed to be the Parthian center of Ctesiphon. However, Italian excavations under Gullini and Invernizzi have conclusively shown that only one stratigraphic layer is pre-Sasanian, and that it was primarily mortuary in nature. Sasanian and Syriac references to Seleucia or <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>(or al-Madāʾin) almost certainly refer to Kokhe, not to the original Hellenistic city. The city was the administrative capital of the Sasanians as well as of the Ch. of E. German excavations in the 1930s uncovered a church which had at least two phases of use, with the later one dating to the end of the 6th cent. Among the finds from this structure were an ostracon with a fragment of a Syriac prayer, a number of pieces of stucco decoration which mirror Sasanian styles, and the remnants of the stucco statue of a saint. The designation and significance of the church are not known, although Seleucia-Ctesiphon functioned as the seat of the Cath. of the Ch. of E. from at least the early 5th cent.</p>

<p>Konat was born in Pampakuda of a priestly family. He studied under his father Yuḥanon Konat, and then Gregorios of Parumala. He was ordained a priest in 1883, and a chorepiscopos in 1926. Between 1901 and 1911, he served as the Priest Trustee of the Malankara Association and continued in this position after the schism of 1911 (he sided with the patriarchal faction). He taught at the Old Seminary in Kottayam, and later established in his town a seminary and Mar Julius Press where he published many liturgical books with prefaces in Syriac. Ignatius Peṭros III/IV bestowed upon him the title of Malankara Malpan, and he may have been the first to hold this distinguished title. He published a periodical called <i>S</i><i>īmat ḥaye</i> in Syriac and Malayalam (he composed most of its Syriac material). He composed and wrote in a beautiful Serṭo hand numerous letters from Malankara to the Syr. Orth. Patriarchate. He is also credited with most of the liturgical translations made from Syriac into Malayalam which are still used today.</p>
<p>Konat’s Syriac writings include general rules on the <i>Šḥimo</i> daily offices, which he prefaced to his edition of this text (Pampakuda, 1915; 4th ed. 1977; 5th ed. 1988), and two brief accounts on the history of the Syriac Church in Malabar (may have been published in <i>Sīmat ḥaye</i>). He also wrote a Syriac grammar, but it is not clear in what language.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Kthobonoyo refers to the spoken (rather than the written) form of classical Syriac as it is used in recent times. Demographically, it is primarily a W.-Syr. feature; its absence in E.-Syr. is probably due to the fact that <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref>, the colloquial, has raised itself to a literary language. The rise of Kthobonoyo is due to a rise in national identity, especially after the Ottoman constitutional reforms of 1908 which provided millet communities the opportunity to form secular organizations. Within the Syr. Orth. community, the <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>irutho</i> movement was formed with much enthusiasm by activists like <ref type="cr">Naʿʿūm Fāʾiq</ref>, and called for the revival of the Syriac language. The first canon of the Patriarchal School of <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> (formed in 1912) stipulates ‘the conversational language in the school is Syriac’, which is repeated in the regulations of the Patriarchal Orphanage in 1920. Speakers of Kthobonoyo included educators such as <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon Dolabani</ref> (1885–1969), and later Kthobonoyo was promoted by <ref type="cr">Fawlos Gabriel</ref> (1912–1971), ʿ<ref type="cr">Abd al-Masīḥ Qarabashī</ref>(1903–1983), and <ref type="cr">Abrohom Nuro</ref> (1923–2009) who was the first to apply it in a home setting. In the second half of the 20th cent., the use of Kthobonoyo was enforced in the seminaries and some of the village schools in <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, and became more popular after immigrations to Europe. Kthobonoyo is primarily a learned, non-native language that requires formal training (with a few known native exceptions in multilingual settings). The aptitude level of Kthobonoyo speakers varies tremendously, despite the fact that speakers tend to be clergymen and <i>malphone</i> well versed in Classical Syriac. A sociolinguistic feature of Kthobonoyo is its male centricity, with very few female speakers. Code-switching is frequent, especially in less formal settings. Kthobonoyo is rich in neologisms and coined terms. While the phonology and morphology of Kthobonoyo are quite similar to Classical Syriac, Kthobonoyo syntax is a subset of that of Classical Syriac.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>de Lagarde, Paul Anton</head><ab type="infobox"/>(1827–1891) 
<p>Scholar of Semitic and Eastern languages and literatures; professor of Eastern languages at the University of Göttingen. His earliest publications are under the name Bötticher (Boetticher), the name of his father, which he later replaced by de Lagarde (sometimes Latinized into Lagardius), a name that existed in his mother’s family.</p>
<p>Born in Berlin, de Lagarde studied theology and oriental languages in Berlin and in Halle, where he habilitated in 1851. In the following years, he spent much time in the British Museum in London, where he was among the first Western scholars to study the Syriac manuscripts that had arrived from <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān in the 1840s. Many of his publications are based on these manuscripts. It was only in 1869 that he was appointed professor at Göttingen, as the successor of the famous Semitist and Hebrew Bible scholar Heinrich Ewald (one of Th. Nöldeke’s teachers).</p>
</ref><p><ref type="cr">In addition to his publications in such fields as Hebrew, Arabic, Armenian, Coptic, and Septuagint, de Lagarde published a number of Syriac texts: the Didascalia Apostolorum (1854); other collections of ecclesiastical law (1856); Titus of Bostra’s work against the Manichaeans, preserved in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150 of the year 411 (1859); Syriac texts dealing with agriculture and related issues, continuing the Greek tradition of Geoponika (1860); the ‘Recognitions’ attributed to Clement of Rome, again from ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150 (1861); and ‘Apocryphal’ books of the OT (1861: Bar Sira, Wisdom of Solomon, Tobith, Baruch I and II, Epistle of Jeremiah, Judith, Prayer of Ananias and his companions, Bel, Dragon, Susannah, I Ezra, I and II Maccabees). A number of shorter texts were grouped together and published as <i>Analecta Syriaca</i> (1858) and <i>Praetermissorum libri duo</i> (1879; which has Syriac printed in Hebrew characters). He also planned a series entitled <i>Bibliotheca Syriaca</i>, of which, however, he was able to prepare only the first volume which, after his death, his student A. Rahlfs edited (1892). Whereas in his public and university life de Lagarde did not shy away from expressing strong views  — thereby sometimes provoking harsh reactions and controversy, not least with his Jewish colleagues  — his Syriac work is sober and very solid. Most of his editions have been often reprinted and are still valuable today (some of them have never been replaced!). De Lagarde’s interests extended beyond philology and text editions, into the fields of linguistics and lexicography. Quite impressive for his day is his list of ‘Persian, Armenian, and Indian words in Syriac’ (included in his <i>Gesammelte Abhandlungen</i>), which is often</ref>quoted in C. Brockelmann’s<ref type="cr"> <i>Lexicon Syriacum</i>.</p>
</ref><p><ref type="cr">De Lagarde was known for his painstaking attention to correct and precise typesetting, reflecting the ms. model as closely as possible. Towards the end of his life he seems to have been instrumental in the development of a new Syriac printing type by the Leipzig printing house Drugulin. He did not live to see it used in his own publications, but it was successfully used from the early 1890s onwards, and it was eternalized in the second edition of Nöldeke’s <i>Kurzgefasste syrische Grammatik</i> (1898; repr. 1966) and in its subsequent English translation (1904; repr. 2001).</p>
</ref><p><ref type="cr">A volume to commemorate de Lagarde’s Syriac work in Göttingen was published in 1968 by the Göttinger Arbeitskreis für syrische Kirchengeschichte.

<p>Bible translator. Lamsa came from the village of Marbishu in Turkey. He attended the English mission school in <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref>, later teaching in the school in Van. He came to the USA in 1916 or 1917 by way of Argentina, taking the name George at the port. He became an American citizen in 1923. He was associated with Episcopalian efforts to revive a mission to the Assyrians after World War I: see his co-authored book <i>The Oldest Christian People</i> (1926). His most characteristic publications began, however, with <i>My Neighbor Jesus: in the Light of his own Language, People, and Time</i> (1932). This established one of his themes, that the Bible could be illuminated by the customs and language of his own Aramaic-speaking community in the Middle East which was, he claimed, little changed since biblical times. He published a translation of the Four Gospels (1933) and then of the whole New Testament, entitled <i>The New Testament according to the Eastern Text Translated from Original Aramaic Sources</i> (1940)  — the ‘eastern text’ being the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>, which, being in ‘Aramaic’, was according to Lamsa the original form of the New Testament. A translation of the whole Peshitta Bible, <i>The Holy Bible from Ancient Eastern Manuscripts</i>, appeared in 1957.</p>
<p>Lamsa’s books had an appeal in the Ch. of E. for a time. He was a member of Patr. <ref type="cr">Eshai Shemʿ<ref type="cr">on</ref> council, and represented the Church as an observer at the Vatican Council in 1964. His own religious thought was, however, broad and unorthodox, and his greatest influence has been among various small Christian and Christian-theosophical bodies in the U. S. A. who continue to reprint his works.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Syriac scholar; professor at the universities of Amsterdam and Leiden. Born from a Dutch family of Norwegian descent, Land enrolled as a student in Leiden in 1850. From early on, Syriac, to which he was introduced by Th. W. J. Juynboll, was among the subjects that attracted him most. Even before submitting his doctoral dissertation in theology (on an OT topic), he published his first monograph, on <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> as a church historian (1856). Land’s first meeting with <ref type="cr">Th. Nöldeke</ref>, who spent the winter of 1857–58 in Leiden, became the beginning of a lifelong friendship between the two men. In the fall of 1857 Land was awarded a grant to study the Syriac mss. in London, which in the 1830s and 1840s had arrived in the British Museum from <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>. Like <ref type="cr">P. A. de Lagarde</ref>, whom he met in London, Land launched his own series, <i>Anecdota Syriaca</i>, in which he planned to publish important Syriac texts taken mainly from the British Museum mss. The first volume appeared in 1862; three more volumes followed in 1868, 1870, and 1875. Although the quality of the editions gave rise to some criticism, these publications significantly contributed to making Syriac literature and Syriac studies more widely known in Europe.</p>
<p>In 1864 Land was appointed professor of oriental languages and philosophy at the Athenaeum Illustre, later the municipal university, of Amsterdam. In 1872, he returned to Leiden, to occupy the chair of philosophy. While publishing extensively on a variety of topics, ranging from philosophy to music, Syriac receded from the foreground of his interests, although he kept teaching it. Among his Syriac students were W. J. van Douwen (from his Amsterdam period), with whom Land co-authored a Latin translation of Yuḥanon of Ephesus’s ‘Lives of the eastern saints’ (1889), G. Wildeboer, who wrote his Leiden dissertation on the Curetonian Gospels (1880), and H. G.

<p>Benedictine Syriac and Armenian scholar. He was born in Namur and studied in Lyon and Rome. From 1959–61 he taught biblical exegesis and Armenian at San Anselmo, Rome, and from 1973–82 Armenian and Ethiopic at the Catholic University of Louvain. For extended periods he served as Novice Master in the Abbey of St. Maurice in Clairvaux (Luxembourg), and then at the Abbey of St. Paul de Wisques (France). In 1953–54 Leloir re-edited the Armenian translation of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>’s ‘Commentary on the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref>’ (CSCO 137, 145), at that time only known in Armenian. When, in 1957, the Chester Beatty Library (Dublin) purchased a ms. containing a large part of the Syriac original, Leloir was asked to edit it; this he published in 1963; just over 20 years later, the Chester Beatty Library was able to purchase some further folios of the same ms., and these too were edited by Leloir (1990, with LT; ET of both by C. McCarthy, 1993). Leloir had a special interest in Ephrem’s witness to the text of the Diatessaron, collecting his evidence in CSCO 227 (1962). Besides working on Ephrem, he also wrote the valuable entry on <ref type="cr">Sahdona</ref> (under ‘Martyrius’) in the <i>Dictionnaire de Spiritualité</i>. Given his expertise in Armenian, he was also able to write authoritatively on the relationship between Syriac and Armenian literature (in contributions to <i>OCA</i> 205 [1978] and 221 [1983]). His work in the Armenian field was largely concerned with the Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles and the Sayings of the Desert Fathers (apart from Ephrem).</p>

<p>French art historian and Syriac scholar. In 1920, Leroy entered the Benedictine order with the monks of Solesmes who, due to the anti-catholic legislation of the Third Republic, were in exile at the Isle of Wight (UK) since 1901 and returned to Solesmes (Sarthe) only in 1922. In 1930, he was sent to Rome, where he graduated in biblical studies from the Pontificio Istituto Biblico in 1933. For the next twenty years he lived as a priest in Paris and taught in various high schools. During his spare time he developed an interest in illuminated Syriac mss., which he investigated first in the Bibliothèque Nationale and later in the other major European libraries. In the early fifties, he studied with André Grabar, the famous scholar of early Christian art, who then taught at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, where Leroy graduated in 1955 with a thesis on the illuminations of the Syriac <ref type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref>. Starting in 1954, as an employee of the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, and stationed for several years at the Institut Français d’Archéologie in <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>, Leroy complemented his earlier work on illuminated Syriac mss. in Europe with research in all major collections of the Middle East. This led to his pioneering 1964 publication, <i>Les manuscrits syriaques à</i><i> peintures</i>, which includes the study of several mss. from <ref type="cr">Ṭur</ref> ʿ<ref type="cr">Abdin</ref>, Iraq, and Syria. In the same period he also wrote his ‘Moines et monastères du Proche-Orient’ (1958), which was subsequently translated into English (1963; repr. 2004). It covers Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, and Iraq.</p>
<p>In the mid-sixties Leroy, together with Serge Sauneron (d. 1976), launched an ambitious project that aimed at the documentation of Coptic wall paintings. The first volume of ‘La peinture murale chez les Coptes’ appeared in 1975. The second volume, which appeared posthumously (1982), included the first detailed description of the wall paintings of <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> known at that time. To this monastery, situated at the intersection of the Coptic and Syriac worlds, he devoted additional publications, studying its condition in the 16th cent. (1967), the decoration of the church (including the two 10th-cent. inscriptions on the wooden doors) (1974), and a flabellum with Syriac inscription dated 1202/3 (1974–75). His contribution to the first Symposium Syriacum (1972) was on the famous 
10th-cent. abbot of Dayr al-Suryān, <ref type="cr">Mushe of Nisibis</ref> (published 1974). Leroy was the first western art historian with a lifelong commitment to the study of the art of the Syriac and other eastern Christian traditions. Along with his pioneering Syriac publications, which remain authoritative today, he published extensively on Coptic, Copto-Arabic, Ethiopian, and Armenian art. In spite of his focused iconographical approach, he always was aware of the larger historical, literary, and cultural contexts and paid due attention to the links between eastern Christian art and late ancient, Byzantine, and Islamic art.</p>

<p>Italian Syriac scholar. An outstanding Semitic scholar, he devoted to Syriac literature only a lesser part of his activity, mainly at the beginning of his career (1910–21) and again later, after having been deprived of his chair at the University of Rome because of his opposition to fascism, when he was employed as a consultant for Oriental mss. at the Vatican Library (1931–39), under the patronage of its learned Prefetto, the future Cardinal Eugène Tisserant. His main writings on Syriac culture include: the edition of a text of popular hermetic philosophy, which he first attributed to ‘Pseudo-Berosus’ (1910), and much later, in an extensive essay involving its Christian Arabic version (1947), to ‘Stomathalassa’; an edition of an E.-Syr. collection of Pythagorean sentences (1910); an annotated Italian translation of the ‘Book of the Laws of Countries’ (1921); and several articles on <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref> (1919–20). These studies, which combine a concern for textual philology learnt from his teacher <ref type="cr">Ignazio Guidi</ref> with a lasting interest in the history of religions, are now collected in <i>Pitagora, Bardesane e altri studi siriaci</i>, ed. R.  Contini (Studi Orientali 8; 1989). Levi Della Vida’s most significant contribution to Syriac studies, however, is arguably his massive volume <i>Ricerche sulla formazione del pi</i><i>ù antico fondo dei manoscritti orientali della Biblioteca Vaticana</i> (SeT 92; 1939), a masterly treatise on several aspects of the history of Oriental studies in Renaissance Europe, while his slimmer monograph <i>Documenti intorno alle relazioni delle Chiese orientali con la S. Sede durante il pontificato di Gregorio XIII</i> (SeT 143; 1948) is still an important source for such topics as Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius Niʿmatullāh</ref>’s stay in Rome.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The Christian liturgical rites can be grouped into families, the eastern ones being associated above all with Constantinople, <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>, and Alexandria. The various Syriac rites fall under the general heading of 
‘Antiochene’, subdivided as E.- and W.-Syr., the latter again further subdivided into Syr. Orth./Catholic, Maron., and (until the early second millennium) Melk.. ‘Antiochene’ is in fact not very appropriate for the E.-Syr. (Ch. of E./Chald.) traditions, whose roots were more connected with <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, rather than Antioch.</p>
<label type="subsection">General developments</label>
<p>Liturgical texts develop considerably over time, and in their present forms they are many-layered, with archaic and much more recent elements side by side: the oldest elements go back to before the E.-/W.-Syr. ecclesiastical divide (5th/6th cent.), and so the two share certain texts (especially in <ref type="cr">poetry</ref>); approximately the 7th to 9th cent. saw the emergence of many rites in the forms known today: traditionally, large-scale liturgical reforms are attributed to <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> (d. 659) in the E.-Syr. tradition, and <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (d. 708) in the W.-Syr.. The earliest long theological prayers known as <i>sedre</i> (or <i>ḥusoye</i>) in the W.-Syr. tradition belong to this period, as do their counterparts, by <ref type="cr">Shalliṭa</ref> and others, in the E.-Syr. The majority of the earliest surviving liturgical mss. belong to the ca. 9th/10th cent. for the W.-Syr. tradition, whereas 
E.-Syr. ones only rarely survive before about 12th cent.</p>
<p>It must have been from about the 7th cent. that the Maron. and Syr. Orth. liturgical traditions began to separate, with the former often retaining archaic elements lost in the latter (e.g. in the baptismal texts and Weekday Office). This may explain surprisingly close parallels between the Maron. and E.-Syr. traditions: the Maron. Anaphora known as the ‘Sharrar’ (or Peter III) has many prayers in common with the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, and the Maronite Weekday Office includes several <i>sugyotho</i> of E.-Syr. origin where they have named authors of the 6th and 7th cent. (see Brock 2004).</p>
<p>In the Melk. tradition the 10th and 11th cent. witnessed the remarkable transition from an Antiochene to a Constantinopolitan rite (roughly co-terminous with the Byzantine reconquest of parts of north Syria, 969–1084); this involved a massive undertaking of translations from Greek into Syriac (and subsequently into Arabic). Several of the poetic texts, including ones by <ref type="cr">John of Damascus</ref>, were subsequently taken over also into the Syr. Orth. tradition, probably in the 11th and 12th cent.</p>
<p>Although the W.-Syr. liturgical tradition had always included many texts translated from Greek, this new influx of materials of Greek origin led to the emergence of two slightly different Syr. Orth. traditions, that of Antioch, incorporating these new elements, and that of <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref>, which did not. It was essentially the Tagrit rite that was introduced into S. India in the 18th and 
19th cent.</p>
<p>In the E.-Syr. tradition, many rites are traditionally associated with the reforms of Patr. Ishoʿyahb III, and/or with the usage of ‘the Upper Monastery’ (of Mar Gabriel and Mar Abraham, <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>). Many new texts were incorporated during the early centuries of the 2nd millennium, in particular prose texts by Eliya III Abū Ḥalīm (d. 1190), verse texts by <ref type="cr">Gewargis Warda</ref>, and <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>onyāthā</i> by <ref type="cr">Khamis bar Qardaḥe</ref> (both 13th cent.?).</p>
<label type="subsection">The Main Liturgical Books</label>
<label type="subsubsection">Ch. of E.</label>
<p>Three Anaphoras are in use, the archaic Anaphora of the Apostles Addai and Mari, and Anaphoras attributed to <ref type="cr">Theodore</ref> and to <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>. For the most part only the former was taken over in the Chald. and Syro-Malabar Churches, and in both cases provided (in different places) with Institution Narratives, which the original lacked (a feature officially recognized, however, by the Vatican in 2001 as legitimate). The other two Anaphoras, when taken over, were simply called the ‘second’ and ‘third’ Anaphoras (thus the Mosul ed. 1901). In mss. the Anaphoras are usually combined with the Baptismal service, with Marriage and Burial services transmitted separately. In the Syro-Malabar Church, whose liturgy had been much adapted to the Roman rite in the 17th cent., there has been considerable discussion over the appropriate form of a ‘restored’ (de-Romanized) Qurbana (on this, see G. Thadikkatt, <i>Liturgical Identity of the Mar Toma Nazrani Church</i> [2004]).</p>
<p>The Weekday Offices are contained in the <ref type="cr">Qdām w-Bāthar</ref> (‘Before and After’, the weeks being so designated, according to which of two choirs commences); for this there is an ET by A. J. Maclean, <i>East Syrian Daily Offices</i> (1894) and a recent reprint of the Syriac (ed. D.  Benjamin, 2004; based on de Qelayta’s edition of 1923). Those parts of the services proper to Sundays and Feasts are contained in the <i>Ḥudr</i><i>ā</i>, for which there is an edition by T. Darmo (3 vols.; Trichur, 1960–62); better known, however, is the earlier Chald. edition by P. Bedjan (3 vols.; 1886–7; repr. 1938; 1 vol. ed., ed. 
P.  Yousif, 2002); a concordance between Darmo and Bedjan is given in <i>The Harp</i> 19 (2006), 117–36. English translations and studies of particular seasons have been made by V. Pathikulangara (Resurrection, 1982; Holy Week, 1990), J. Moolan (<i>Subbara</i>, or Annunciation to Nativity, 1985), and P. Kuruthukulangara (Nativity, 1989).</p>
<p>Another ms. collection, with hymns and anthems for festivals, is known as the <i>Gazza</i>; this has never been printed, but materials from it are included in the editions of the <i>Ḥudr</i><i>ā</i> by Darmo and Bedjan.</p>
<label type="subsubsection">Syr. Orth.</label>
<p>This tradition stands out from all others in its number of available Anaphoras, said to be nearly 80, though only a dozen or so are in current use, and a large number have not yet been published. Some are translated from Greek, while others were composed in Syriac, the latest belonging to about the middle of the 2nd millennium. Both mss. and printed editions vary greatly in the number and selection of Anaphoras they provide, though that of St. James is normally present; this Anaphora, whose origins are connected with Jerusalem, provided the structural model for many of the other Anaphoras. The largest printed collection, with nineteen, is that of Pampakuda, 1931, though the critical edition (<i>Anaphorae Syriacae</i>, 1939–81), now discontinued, covers 22 anaphoras over the course of its 7 fascicles (tables indicating the contents of main printed editions can be found in <i>Ephemerides Liturgicae</i> 102 [1988], 440–45).</p>
<p>Originally there seem to have been at least three different baptismal rites, but only that attributed to <ref type="cr">Severus</ref> remains in use. The Betrothal and Marriage rites were once separated in time, but in modern editions they are combined as a single rite. There are separate funeral services for clergy and laity, and within each of these, for different categories, e.g. bishops, priests, monks, nuns; men, women, children. Besides the bilingual editions mentioned in the Bibliography, the Syriac texts for Baptism, Marriage, and (Lay) Funerals were published in India by the Mar Julius Press (Pampakuda) in 1979.</p>
<p>The Weekday Office is contained in the <i>Šḥimo</i>, for which there are several printed editions, notably Jerusalem 1936; Pampakuda (4th ed. 1977), St. Ephrem Monastery, Holland, 1981 (and subsequent editions). A  bilingual form of the Pampakuda edition was published by SEERI (Kottayam) in 2006. Also arranged for the days of the week is a collection of prayers of monastic origin, known as the <i>Š</i><i>bito</i> (printed ed. Monastery of St. Ephrem, 1993).</p>
<p>Liturgical texts for Sundays and Feasts are provided in the <i>Fenqito</i>, of which there are two printed editions (Mosul, 1886–96, in 7 vols., and Pampakuda, 1962–3, in 3 vols.), although in many churches mss. are still used. The contents of the two editions, and of individual mss., vary considerably; one noticeable difference between the two editions is that the Mosul edition (Syr. Catholic) includes the prose <i>Sedre</i> (which are usually transmitted separately in mss., and so are absent from the Pampakuda edition). An abbreviated and adapted English version of the Mosul edition was made by Fr. Francis Acharya (d. 2002), <i>Crown of the Year</i> (3 vols.; Kurisumala Ashram, 1982–86).</p>
<p>The liturgical texts of the reformed Mar Thoma Church in South India are for the most part fairly close to their Syr. Orth. antecedents.</p>
<label type="subsubsection">Maron.</label>
<p>The learned Patr. <ref type="cr">Istịfān al-Duwayhi</ref> (d. 1704) listed 
27 Anaphoras in use by the Maronites, but printed editions give many less, and some later ones give prominence to the Roman rite; a return to the true Antiochene tradition was the aim of reforms initiated in 1971, and mandated in 1991. Most of the Maron. Anaphoras are shared with the Syr. Orth., though a few are confined to the Maron. tradition, notably the archaic ‘Sharrar’. Although Maron. liturgical mss. earlier than the 16th cent. are only rarely preserved, many liturgical books preserve early features lost in the rest of the Antiochene liturgical tradition. This applies in particular to the Baptismal rite and to the Weekday Office (<i>Šḥimto</i>). An ET of the Divine Office throughout the year, providing texts for <i>Ramš</i><i>o</i> and <i>Ṣapro</i> for Sundays and Feasts, was published by the Diocese of St. Maron (USA) in 3 vols. (<i>Prayer of the Faithful</i>, 1982–5); this goes back (via French) to a simplified edition in Arabic, made by the liturgical scholar (now Bp.) B. Gemayel.</p>
<label type="subsubsection">Melk.</label>
<p>Only the very oldest Melkite liturgical mss. preserve the original Antiochene rite, whereas all the rest represent the Constantinopolitan rite (itself ultimately of Antiochene origin), and so the range of different liturgical books is basically the same as in the Greek Orthodox tradition. The oldest texts often have materials in common with the Syr. Orth. and/or Maron. traditions. In the case of an archaic short baptismal rite, there is still no post-baptismal anointing (this had been first introduced in the Antiochene area ca. 400). The multilingual character of the Melk. liturgical tradition is brought out by the existence of bilingual texts, especially Syriac-Arabic, although occasionally Syriac-Greek, or Greek in Syriac characters. Syriac remained in use as one of the liturgical languages until at least the 17th cent.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Loʿozar bar Sobhto</head><ab type="infobox"/>Lazarus (early 9th cent.) 
[Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>; author of an Anaphora as well as of liturgical and theological works. Loʿozar served as Bp. of Baghdad in the early 9th cent., taking the name of Philoxenos. There are indications that he also was known as Basil. If that is correct, he probably should be identified with the ‘Basil, Bp. of Baghdad’, who along with his two brothers and the son of their sister donated several books to the Monastery of Mor Yuḥanon of Qurdis in Dara (one of these books is the present ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,151, which contains writings of <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</ref>).</p>
<p>Loʿozar is the author of an Anaphora (inc.: ‘Oh God, who are the sea of peace …’), which is preserved in a number of Syr. Orth. mss. <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, in his <i>Mnorat Qudše</i>(‘Candelabrum of the sanctuary’), quotes passages from Loʿozar’s (otherwise unknown) work on the divine providence and human freewill, in which Loʿozar apparently tried to find a compromise between attributing absolute power to providence on the one hand or freewill on the other hand. Elsewhere in the same work, Bar ʿEbroyo quotes from one of Loʿozar’s letters, while in his ‘Ethicon’ the Maphryono states that Loʿozar wrote about the origins of Syriac liturgical chant and about the introduction in the Syriac churches of the ‘<i>qonune</i>’ of <ref type="cr">John of Damascus</ref>. We also know of a commentary on baptism, a <i>mimro</i> on the consecration of the holy chrism, and a commentary on the words said in the Eucharist, ‘the heavenly bread we break’, which led to a controversy and to a schism in Loʿozar’s day.</p>
<p>That in spite of Loʿozar’s obvious significance as a writer so little of his works is preserved may perhaps be due to the unfortunate end of his tenure as a bp. <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, the chronicler of the year 1234, and Bar ʿEbroyo, in his ‘Ecclesiastical Chronicle’, report that Loʿozar was deposed as bp. by his Patr., <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref>, in 829, due to accusations brought against him by some of his own faithful. No details on the nature of these accusations are provided.</p>

<p>Monk on the Holy Mountain of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, scholar, author of a commentary on the Pauline Epistles. The commentary is fragmentarily preserved in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,683 (one of the mss. presented to <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> by the Coptic Patr. of Syr. descent Afrahām b. Zurʿa around 980). The commentary was divided into four parts and portions are preserved only for part 3 (Galatians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians) and part 4 (Hebrews). A note written by one of Loʿozar’s disciples, Giwargis of Beth Naqe, gives information about his teacher, who is said to have been a scholar in the investigation of dogma (<i>buḥono d-dogma</i>). The commentary, which is said to have been based on the work of <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref>, is provided with critical signs (dots and crosses) to assist with the interpretation. Inserted between the two parts is a chronological and historical section, which reaches until the accession of Caliph al-Mahdī (774) (E. W. Brooks in CSCO 5–6, 337–
341 [Syr.], 265–75 [LT]). This section seems to provide a date for the composition of the work, if one assumes that it belonged to the original work. The scribe of the ms., Ḥarith bar Sisin, of Sanbaṭ (probably in Egypt) and of <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>, is also responsible for ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,682, a commentary on the Gospels of John and Mark, which was put together (<i>mkannaš</i>) by Ḥarith on the basis of many sources, Christian and pagan (quoted are: John Chrysostom, <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, the Sibylline Oracles, and a work called ‘Hermes’). The question then arises whether Ḥarith, the copyist of the commentary of ms. Add. 14,683, really was the redactor of the commentary of ms. Add. 14,682 (which then would be the redactor’s autograph). Or did he only copy the latter, as he did the former? Wright is inclined to see Ḥarith as the copyist of both commentaries and to attribute both works to Loʿozar (already in his <i>Catalogue</i>, and more explicitly in his <i>Short history</i>). Baumstark, however, refrains from accepting Loʿozar’s authorship of the Gospel commentary for lack of evidence. Barsoum agrees with Baumstark and regards Ḥarith as the redactor of the Gospel Commentary, whom he takes to be a Melkite on the basis of a passage in al-Masʿūdī (in <i>Murū</i><i>j al-dhahab</i>). To Loʿozar’s authorship of the commentary on the Pauline Epistles, one scholion can be added; it deals with the order of the Seraphs according to <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</ref> and it is explicitly attributed to him (preserved in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 18,295, f. 149v; see also Barsoum, 366).</p>
<p>Additional information about Loʿozar’s disciples or his school may be gathered from ms. Damascus, Syr. Orth. Patr. 12/23 (previously Jerusalem, St. Mark’s Monastery 123), which contains works by Pseudo-Dionysius and which was written by Yaʿqub bar Yonathan ‘in the school of (…) Rabban Mor (…) of Beth Qandasa’ ca. 890. The date of this ms. led Kaufhold to question Loʿozar’s traditional date (which is based solely on the chronological section inserted into his work) and to suggest that Loʿozar worked a few decades later than has generally been assumed (the alternative would be that Yaʿqub bar Yonathan was not Loʿozar’s immediate disciple).</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The village of Maʿad is 14 km. northeast of Byblos (Jbeil), 52 km. from <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>, 525 m. above sea level. The Church of Mar Charbel is built on the remains of a 1st-cent. temple to the Roman God Satrapos. The base of the temple, columns, and capitals were used in the building of a church dating from the 6th cent. At a later period, in the 12th or 13th cent., a substantial narthex was added to the W. end along with new vaulting.</p>
<p>At least two layers of decoration are painted on the walls of the church: 1. to the first period belong the wall paintings of the apse, and paintings on the northern wall of a small annex in the southeast corner of the church, at the end of the southern nave; 2. a large Dormition of the Virgin, on the southern wall of this same small room, belongs to the second period. Paintings of the second period also cover parts of the paintings on the northern wall.</p>
<p>In the apse, four evangelists stand on either side of a central crowned saint who has not been identified. On the northern wall of the annex are two more unidentified saints from the first period, accompanied by two donors, a male and a female. On this same wall and partially covering the saints underneath, is the large figure of an archangel, between two more saints, also unidentified. These latter saints, and a donor on the same wall, belong to the second period. Accompanying the twelve apostles and Christ, beside the Virgin’s bier, in the Dormition, are St. Dionysios the Areopagite, and also the Jew Jephonias, whose hands have been cut off by the archangel Gabriel. The donor of this painting is represented behind Jephonias.</p>
<p>All the wall paintings in Mar Charbel are inscribed in Syriac, in a mixture of Serṭo and Esṭrangela which sometimes contains Arabic words.</p>
<p><ref type="cr">Isṭifān al-Duwayhī</ref>, Maron. Patr. in the 17th cent., writes that Ḥanna al-Franjiyya, Bint al-Khabbaz, was buried in this church in 1243. This date corresponds to the style of the second group of paintings. The style of each layer of painting is distinctive. The hand of a 12th  cent. French painter has been identified in the first layer. The style of the second layer belongs to the Syr. Orth. tradition of <ref type="cr">Bahdeidat</ref> and <ref type="cr">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>, in the 13th cent.</p>

<p>Anonymous 4th-cent. Greek ascetical texts. The original Greek writings survive in three overlapping collections probably assembled in Byzantine monastic circles of the 10th and 11th cent. The most common attribution is to ‘Macarius’, identified with either of the famous 4th-cent. Egyptian monks, Macarius the Great or Macarius the Alexandrian. Their authorship is disproved by study of the spiritual vocabulary of the writings and the use of quotations from them in a 5th-cent. anti-Messalian dossier preserved by <ref type="cr">John of Damascus</ref>. These indications link the Pseudo-Macarian texts with an ascetical movement originating in late 4th-cent. Asia Minor or Syria, within a culture strongly influenced by Syriac Christianity.</p>
<p>The collections contain exhortations and responses to questions about prayer and progress in the spiritual life. The writings emphasize conflict between sin and grace within the ‘inner person’, characterized in vivid images of sensation, mingling, indwelling, and fullness. The sin present in human beings is ‘uprooted’ by divine power, when the Lord comes to dwell in the heart and fills it with the Spirit. When liberated from the passions, one becomes a ‘perfect’ or ‘mature’ Christian and can fulfill the commandments with ease. Despite powerful experiences of the Spirit, life continues to be a struggle. Even the perfect Christian is always at risk of relapse, whether through inattention or by God’s design as a test of faith.</p>
<p>The association of these texts with ‘Messalianism’ in controversial literature of the 4th and 5th cent. seems to have been unknown or overlooked by both contemporary and later authors. The so-called ‘Great Letter’ (<i>Epistola Magna</i>) of Pseudo-Macarius was the major source for <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nyssa</ref>’s ascetic treatise commonly known as <i>De instituto christiano</i>‘On a Christian way of life’. Macarian themes and language strongly influenced later writers, notably Diadochus of Photike and <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>. At least two Syriac translations survive; among these are two 6th-cent. mss., by far the oldest extant mss. of the (Peudo-)Macarian corpus. There are also Arabic and Georgian versions of some of the texts.</p>

<ab type="infobox"/>Syro-Malabar Catholic Church 
<p>This <i>sui juris</i> Catholic Church of the E.-Syr. liturgical tradition represents the continuity of the Catholic ecclesial tradition in South India that came into being in the 16th cent. (see <ref type="cr">Thomas Christians</ref>). Under Portuguese and other European missionary influence in the late 16th and early 17th cent. the local Church became heavily Romanized, especially after the <ref type="cr">Synod of Diamper</ref> (1599); Syriac, however, was retained as the liturgical language by Archbishop Francisco Roz, SJ, even though the rite was adapted to Roman norms. Following the revolt against the Padroado and the Jesuits in 1653, the Propaganda Fide sent the Carmelite Sebastiani to Malabar (1659) as an Apostolic Commissiary, and as a result the Catholic party came under the double jurisdiction of the Padroado and the Propaganda Fide, though the influence of the former waned after the Dutch took Cochin in 1663. This event, however, led to the expulsion of Sebastiani, though not before he had consecrated an Indian bp., Alexander (1663–87) to take his place. Sebastiani left an interesting account of his time in Malabar (see Pallath 2006). Another informative account, covering 1773–86, is by a Malabar priest (see Paremmakkal 1971), who went to Lisbon in 1783 for the consecration of another Indian bp., Mar Karyatil, who, however, died in Goa (1786) on his way back to Malabar. With the exception of Alexander and Karyatil, all other bishops were Europeans, and it was only in 1896 that three native Indian bishops were again appointed, thus marking the beginnings of an indigenous hierarchy, which was only able to develop again in the 20th cent.</p>
<p>In 1923 Ernakulam was made a metropolitan see, with seven suffragan eparchies, and in 1958 Changanacherry became a second metropolitan see. Since 1962 a number of eparchies outside Kerala have been created (including one for USA, in 2001). On 16 Dec. 1992 Ernakulam-Angamali was raised to the status of a Major Archbishopric, and in 1995 two further metropolitan sees were created (Tellichery and Trichur). There is a separate archbishopric in Kottayam for the Knanaya, or Southists (this goes back to the creation of an Apostolic Vicariate for them in 1911). There are sizable diasporas in North America, Europe, and the Gulf States. The total number of faithful is said to be between three and four million.</p>
<p>There are a large number of religious communities for both men and women, the most well known of them being the Carmelites of Mary the Immaculate (CMI), founded in 1831 by the Blessed Kuriakos Elias Chavara (who, among other things, set up a Syriac <ref type="cr">printing</ref> press in Mannanam in 1844).</p>
<p>Although very little Syriac literature has ever been produced in S. India, numerous literary and, above all, liturgical mss. were copied there, and in the 19th and earlier part of the 20th cent. a number of Syriac printing presses were operative (St. Joseph’s Press at Mannanam was especially productive). Syriac was regularly taught at seminaries, and still is at some, though the shift to Malayam as the liturgical language after the Second Vatican Council has led to a great decline in widespread knowledge of the language. Among works of Syriac scholarship produced in Malabar, two should be singled out: 
T. Arayathinal’s <i>Aramaic (Syriac) Grammar</i> (1957; repr. 2007), and E. Thelly’s <i>Syriac-English-Malayalam Lexicon</i> (1999), based on Audo’s <i>Simta</i>.</p>
<p>Although the reforms of Vatican II have led to the decline of knowledge of Syriac, at the same time they have encouraged the recovery of the indigenous E.-Syr. liturgical tradition. In practice, however, liturgical renewal has led to much controversy over the direction it should take: a return to the Syriac sources, inculturation (including the adoption of some Hindu customs), or retaining a more western perspective. A vocal advocate for the indigenous tradition of the Thomas Christians and author of many books on the subject was Fr. Placid Podipara CMI.</p>

<ab type="infobox"/>The Thozhiyur Church
<p>The Malabar Independent Syrian Church is the oldest of the various jurisdictions into which the non-Roman Catholic section of the <ref type="cr">Thomas Christians</ref> has been divided since the 17th cent. Following the imposition of Portuguese control and European bishops after the <ref type="cr">Synod of Diamper</ref> in 1599, there was an attempt by the whole community to break free of Jesuit control in 1653 at the Coonan Cross incident. Subsequently, as a result of the successful efforts of Carmelite missionaries, the majority of St. Thomas Christians returned to Roman obedience (see <ref type="cr">Malabar Catholic Church</ref>). The remaining section (called <i>Puthenkuttukar</i> or New Party to distinguish them from the Romo-Syrians who were <i>Pazhayakuttukar</i> or Old Party), continued to use latinized E.-Syr. rites, but began to come under the influence of periodic visitors of the Syr. Orth. tradition.</p>
<p>A definitive step took place in 1751 when the Syr. Orth. Mafryono Basilios Shakrallah arrived in Kerala, accompanied by Mar Gregorios of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> and another companion, whom the Mafryono soon consecrated with the title ‘Mar Ivanios, bp. of India’. The party seems to represent a more systematic attempt to introduce W.-Syr. usage than had been the case with earlier visitors. The delegation was also authorised by the Patr. to regularize the Orders of the Indian head of the Puthenkuttukar community, Mar Thoma V, with the expectation that he would minister under the jurisdiction of the Mafryono and his companions. Squabbles about money and jurisdiction prevented this intended outcome, and Mar Thoma V died in about 1765, without having been re-consecrated, but having himself consecrated his nephew as Mar Thoma VI.</p>
<p>The Mafryono gathered a small household, among whom he disseminated Syr. Orth. usage. Immediately prior to his death in 1764, he consecrated a native priest of the Kattumangat family as bp., giving him the title of Mar Koorilose. For several years the new bp. lived quietly in a monastic community at Thevanal. In 1770 Mar Gregorios and Mar Ivanios consecrated Mar Thoma VI as Mar Dionysios I. Mar Gregorios seems to have very soon regretted this action and in 1772 raised Mar Koorilose to the rank of Metropolitan. Mar Koorilose also received a ring from the Rajah of Cochin, the traditional acknowledgement of the head of the St. Thomas Christians. Mar Dionysios managed to imprison his rival, who eventually escaped and fled to the village of Anjur in the territory of the Zamorin of Calicut, later British Malabar. A gift of land from a prominent Muslim, whose son Mar Koorilose had healed, enabled a Cathedral Church to be built at nearby Thozhiyur.</p>
<p>Following the failure of validly consecrated bishops among Mar Dionysios I’s successors in the early 19th cent., recourse was had to a successor of Mar Koorilose at Thozhiyur, Mar Philoxenos II, who consecrated three bishops to Malankara Metropolitan (Pulikottil Mar Dionysios II ca. 1813; Punnathra Mar Dionysios III in 1816; Cheppat Mar Dionysios IV in 1825) and who himself occupied that position for several years.</p>
<p>Important legal rulings in the 1850s established the independence of the Thozhiyur Church from either the Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> or the Malankara Metropolitan.</p>
<p>In 1894 the two Thozhiyur bishops (Mar Athanasios I and Mar Koorilose V) consecrated a Metropolitan for that section of the Puthenkuttukar which repudiated Patriarchal authority and desired a degree of reform (see <ref type="cr">Mar Thoma Syrian Church</ref>).</p>
<p>The community has always been Syr. Orth. in rite. It has about 15 churches and priests, and several schools. The Church is active in ecumenical activities in Kerala and outside India. In 1998 and 2008 the Metropolitans were Ecumenical Observers at the Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops. In 2006 both current bishops (Mar Koorilose IX and Mar Basilios I) participated in the consecration of bishops for the Free Church of England.</p>
<p>A Constitution was drawn up in 1947, appointing a Sabha Mandalam, representing all the churches, for special business such as electing a bp., and Council of Clergy and Laity to assist the Metropolitan in governing the Church.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s worship has been celebrated mainly in Malayalam, though Syriac is still used for the Daily Offices and midweek Qurbanas at Thozhiyur Cathedral.</p>

<ab type="infobox"/>Syro-Malankara Catholic Church 
<p>This independent Catholic Church of W.-Syr. liturgical tradition came into existence in 1930 when the Syr. Orth. metropolitan Mar Ivanios (P. T. Geevarghese, 1882–1953), along with his suffragan Mar Theophilus and many of their flock, entered into communion with Rome (see <ref type="cr">Thomas Christians</ref>). By a Papal Constitution of 11 June 1932 Trivandrum was made a Metropolitan See <i>sui iuris</i>, with a suffragan eparchy of Tiruvalla; further eparchies have since been created in 1978 (Battery), 1996 (Martandom, in Tamil Nadu), and 2003 (Muvattupuzha). In 2006 Tiruvalla was raised to a Metropolitan See. A year earlier, on 10 Feb. 2005, the status of the Malankara Catholic Church was raised by Pope John Paul II to that of a Major Archiepiscopal Church, with the canonical installation taking place on 14 May 2005; at the same time the title ‘Catholicos’ for its head was officially recognized. Also in 2005 a bp. was ordained, for the first time, for Malankara Catholics in America and Europe; in India, however, they have no pastoral provision of their own outside the state of Kerala, a matter of grievance to both them and the Syro-Malabar Catholics. The total number of Malankara Catholics is between a quarter and a half million.</p>
<p>There are some flourishing monastic orders, notably the Bethany Fathers (Order of the Imitation of Christ, OIC) and Bethany Sisters, and the Daughters of Mary. An important liturgical contribution was made by the late abbot of the Kurisumala Ashram, Fr. Francis Acharya (Mahieu; 1912–2002) in the form of a four-volume adapted translation of the W.-Syr. Weekday and Festal Services throughout the year (<i>Prayer with the Harp of the Spirit</i>, 1982–6).</p>
<p>Although serving all the Indian Churches of Syriac tradition, the St. Ephrem Ecumenical Research Institute (SEERI) in Kottayam, inaugurated on 14 Sept. 1985, comes under the jurisdiction of the Syro-Malankara bp. of Tiruvalla. SEERI is by far the most active promoter of Syriac language and tradition in Kerala, providing, among other things, MA and Doctoral programs; it has also hosted international <ref type="cr">Syriac conferences</ref> every four years, commencing in 1987. Its many publications include the journal <i>The Harp</i> (1987–) and the monograph series <i>Moran Etho</i> (1988–).</p>

<p>The Malankara Orthodox Church (MOC) proudly claims to have been founded by St. Thomas, one of the twelve apostles of Christ. From the early centuries of the Common Era, the St. Thomas Christians of Kerala had intermittent relationship with the Syriac communities in the ancient Persian Empire. Regular contacts were rather difficult, because of the Arab-Muslim control of the trade route in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>In the 15th cent. the relationship with the E.-Syr. Church was apparently strong, but this was abruptly broken by the Portuguese presence in the Indian sub-continent. In the so-called <ref type="cr">Synod of Diamper</ref> (1599), Dom. Alexis Menezis, Archbishop of Goa, with the support of the king of Cochin, was able to bring the St. Thomas Christians under the authority of Rome. In 1653 the great majority rejected the forced union with Rome at the famous Coonan Cross. As they wanted to retain Syriac language and liturgy, and above all the ecclesiastical independence, they wrote letters to various Eastern patriarchates requesting to send them a bp. Thus in 1665, in a Dutch vessel Mar Gregorios, the Syr. Orth. bp. of ‘Jerusalem’ reached Kerala and consecrated Mar Thoma  I, as the bp. of the St. Thomas Christians. In 1685, Mar Baselios Yaldo and Mar Ivanios Ḥidayatallah, two more Antiochian prelates, arrived. However, the Syr. Orth. liturgy and the Serṭo script were widely used only much later. E.-Syr. influence is evident from the fact the six bishops who headed the community between 1665 and 1765 took the title Mar Thoma I to VI.</p>
<p>In 1751, the arrival of a Syr. Orth. delegation consisting of Baselios Shakrallah, Mar Gregorios, Ramban Yoḥannan, and a few deacons, marks the beginning of the introduction of the Serṭo script and the Syr. Orth. liturgy in the Malankara Orthodox Church. Mar Thoma VI (consecrated by his predecessor in 1765), the head of the Syrians, after much hesitation, consented to be re-consecrated by the Antiochian bishops under the name Mar Dionysios I (in 1770).</p>
<p>Meanwhile in 1772, the Antiochian bp. Mar Gregorios consecrated a native bp. named Mar Koorilose. Mar Dionysios I (alias Mar Toma VI) used his political influence to expel the rival bp. to Thozhiyur, in the kingdom of Cochin. This marks the origin of the so-called <ref type="cr">Malabar Independent Syrian Church</ref> (or ‘Thozhiyur Church’).</p>
<p>In 1815 Pulikottil Joseph Mar Dionysios (consecrated by Mar Philoxenos, the second bp. of Thozhiyur) founded the Old Seminary (the present Orthodox Theological Seminary) with the generous support of the British Resident Col. Munro. Following the death of Mar Dionysios (in 1816), the English missionaries assumed the direction of the Old Seminary and modern education started in Kerala for the first time. The missionaries had the dream to train native clergy and to reform the liturgical practices of the Malankara Orthodox Church. The native clergy were opposed to it, and in 1836 the missionaries left the Seminary. However, they did convert a few Syrian Christians to the Anglican Church.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some of the Syrians favourable to the reforms, sent a deacon to <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> and in 1843, Patr. Mar Eliya II consecrated him under the name Mathews Mar Athanasios. He was the first Indian bp. consecrated by a Syr. Orth. Patr. On his return to India, he led the efforts for reforms with some success thanks to the support of the English missionaries and the local rulers. Cheppattu Mar Dionysios, the head of the Malankara Orthodox Church was unwilling to fight against the reformers, abdicated in favour of a visiting Antiochian prelate named Yoyakim Mar Koorilose. Though he could not provide effective leadership for the community against the reformers, during his 20 years stay in Kerala, Mar Koorilose visited parishes and completed the introduction of 
Antiochian liturgical practices. In 1864, the Patriarch Yaʿqub II consecrated a native prelate named Joseph Mar Dionysios (d.1909). Being unable to contain the progress of the reformers, he appealed to the Patr. to visit India. Thus Patr. Peṭros III visited Malabar and during his two year stay (1875–77), he brought the Malankara Orthodox Church under the Syr. Orth. Patriarchate of Antioch. In 1876, the Patr. convened a synod in Mulanthuruthy (near Cochin) and established an administrative structure. The parishes over which the ‘Malankara Metropolitan’ had little or no control, were organized under six dioceses, and six bishops were consecrated. Thus the system of a single metropolitan for the entire Church came to an end.</p>
<p>A few years later, the royal court of Travancore made a verdict in favour of Mar Joseph Dionysios and the Malankara Orthodox Church. The reformed group established themselves as an independent church, known as ‘the Mar Thoma Syrian Church’.</p>
<p>In the first decade of the 20th cent., the relationship between the Patr. Mar ʿ<ref type="cr">Abdullāh II</ref> and Mar Geevarghese Mar Dionysios became tense on the question of authority over properties of the Malankara Orthodox Church. This led to the excommunication of Mar Dionysios and the division of the Malankara Orthodox Church into two groups, one accepting the supreme authority of the patriarch and the other rejecting it. The group led by Mar Dionysios invited Patr. ʿ<ref type="cr">Abdulmasīḥ II</ref>, who was deposed by the Turkish authorities. In 1912, he consecrated Baselios Pawlos I (d. 1914), the first Cath. of the Malankara Orthodox Church. Thus began the major division and a series of litigations which lasted for four decades. In 1934, the General Assembly of the Malankara Orthodox Church adopted a Constitution and endorsed the claims of autocephaly. In 1958, the Supreme Court of India made a verdict in favour of the Cath. Thanks to the initiatives of the Patriarch <ref type="cr">Ignatius Yaʿ<ref type="cr">qub III</ref>and the Catholicos Geevarghese II (1929–64), the two groups were united. In 1964, Patriarch Yaʿqub III presided over the consecration of the Catholicos Augen I (d. 1975).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the unity did not last for more than 12 years. The Patr. consecrated bishops and finally in 1975, a Cath. (‘<ref type="cr">Maphrian</ref>’) for the group which accepted his authority. Now the Malankara Orthodox Church remains divided under two Catholicoi and two synods.</p>
<p>The Malankara Orthodox Church has a membership of about 1 million, 1100 parishes, 1200 priests, and 18 bishops. There are several schools, Colleges, Engineering and Medical Faculties, hospitals and orphanages under its administration. The Malankara Orthodox Church follows the Syr. Orth. Liturgy (Mosul tradition). But the liturgical language is Malayalam. Hindi and English are, however, also used in North India or outside India.</p>

</head><ab type="infobox"/>Jacobite Syrian Christian Church
<p>The W.-Syr. Church in India which is an integral part of the Syr. Orth. Church. The Syr. Orth. Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> is its spiritual head, and the Cath. of India (<ref type="cr">Maphrian</ref>) is the regional head. The Cath. presides over the regional Synod, and, in the role of Malankara Metropolitan, presides over a democratic body of elected parish representatives, responsible for temporal administration.</p>
<p>Though direct evidence is scant, tradition attributes the origins of the Church to the Apostle Thomas. The long history of trade between the south-western coast of India and the Middle East and the presence of a Jewish community of traders in this part of India makes this apostolic connection plausible. The earliest indirect evidence, cited by <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref> and Jerome, suggesting the presence of Christians in India is from the alleged mission of Pantaenus of Alexandria to India in ca. 190 where he is said to have encountered natives who were acquainted with the Gospel of Matthew.</p>
<p>While the dominant view is that the <ref type="cr">Thomas Christians</ref> were continually in communion with the Ch. of E. under the Cath.-Patr. of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th cent., the Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church holds that Thomas Christians held in great esteem the ecclesiastical authority of the Patr. of Antioch over the ‘East,’ laid down in the canons of the Council of Nicaea (325) and the Council of Constantinople (381), ‘East’ being interpreted to include Persia and India. They received bishops from Persia, who, at least until the late 5th cent., acknowledged the ecclesiastical position of the Patr. of Antioch. As late as the 16th cent., when the ecclesiastical relation with the Ch. of E. was in ascendancy, the recognition of the canonical pre-eminence of Antioch in Malankara is attested in the ‘Narratives of Joseph the Indian’ (1507), although incorrectly identifying the Cath. as the successor of St. Peter at Antioch. It further argues that the fragmented evidence concerning the pre-Portuguese period is insufficient to establish the doctrinal confession of the Malankara Church as that of the Ch. of E. or preclude at least intermittent relations with the non-Chalcedonian Patriarchates of Alexandria and Antioch. However, it concedes continuous relations with the Ch. of E. between the 14th and 16th cent.</p>
<p>The history from the 15th cent. onward is well-documented (see Thomas Christians). The community that rejected the authority of Rome in 1653 gravitated to the Syr. Orth. Patriarchate of Antioch by 1665, and this relationship was then nurtured by bishops who were delegated from Mesopotamia. Schisms within the community seeded the current <ref type="cr">Malabar Independent Church</ref> (ca. 1772), Church of South India (1836), <ref type="cr">Mar Thoma Church</ref> (1889), <ref type="cr">Malankara Orthodox Church</ref> (1912/1975), and <ref type="cr">Malankara Catholic Church</ref> (1930) leaving the Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church alone under the Syr. Orth. Patriarchate today.</p>
<p>The first head of the Church, after it asserted a Syr. Orth. identity, was Archdeacon Parambil Thomas (1637–70), the chief protagonist of the ‘Coonan Kurishu Satyam’ of 1653 (Oath at the Leaning Cross, Mattanchery); shortly thereafter, he assumed episcopal dignity with the name Mar Thoma I and was subsequently consecrated canonically by the first Syr. Orth. delegate, Mor Gregorios ʿAbdel al-Jaleel, who arrived in 1665. He was succeeded by eight indigenous metropolitans who assumed the same titular name, ending with Thomas  IX (d. 1817). In the interim, Mar Thoma VI, fearing the invalidity of his first consecration by the hands of his predecessor, was re-consecrated as Mar Dionysius I in 1770 by Mor Gregorios Yuḥanon, Patriarchal delegate, but his successor resumed the line as Mar Thoma  VII. The Dionysios line was resumed in 1815 with the consecration of Dionysios II as a rival to the Thomas line. Mar Athanasios Mathews was the first to be consecrated by a patr., in 1843 at <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, but lapsed into schism over Anglican inspired reforms. In 1876, Patr. 
Petros III/IV consecrated six bishops to administer newly formed dioceses along with the Malankara Metropolitan Dionysios V (consecrated in 1865). Dionysios V was followed by other Malankara Metropolitans, prominent among whom are Dionysios VI (excommunicated in 1911), Mar Kurillos Paulose, and Mar Athanasios Paulose. In 1964, Patr.<ref type="cr"> Ignatius Yaʿqub III</ref> consecrated Mar Baselios Augen as ‘Cath. of the East,’ only to excommunicate him in 1975 and replace him with Mar Baselios Paulose II (d. 1996). In 2002, a ‘Cath. of India’ was consecrated with the name Baselios Thomas I.</p>
<p>Many bishops and monks were delegated from Mesopotamia to Malankara from the 17th cent. onwards. Prominent among them are Mor Gregorios ʿAbd al-Jaleel, bp. of Jerusalem (arrived 1665, died 1671, interred at North Parur), Maphrian Mor Baselios Yaldo (arr. and d. 1685, int. Kothamangalam), Mor Ivanios Ḥidayatallah (arr. 1685, d. 1693, int. Mulanthuruthy), Maphrian Mor Shakrallah Baselios (arr. 1751, d. 1764, int. Kandanad), Mor Gregorios Yuḥanon (arr. 1749, d. 1773, int. Mulanthuruthy), Mor Ivanios Yuḥanon (arr. 1751, d. 1794, int. Chengannur), Mor Dioscoros Yuḥanon (arr. 1806, departed 1809), Mor Athanasios ʿAbd al-Masīḥ (arr. 1825, dep. 1827), Mor Kurillos Yuyakim (arr. 1846, d. 1874, int. Mulanthuruthy), Mor Athanasios Stephanos (arr. 1849, dep. 1851), Mor Athanasios Shemʿoon (arr. 1849/1881, d. 1889, int. Kottayam), Mor Ostatheos Ṣleebo (arr. 1881, d. 1930, int. Kunnamkulam), Mor <ref type="cr">Elias Malke</ref> (arr. 1909/1927, d. 1962, int. Manjinikkara), Rabban ʿAbd al-Aḥad (later Patr. Yaʿqub III) (arr. 1933, dep. 1946), Rabban Mushe Salama (arr. 1951, dep. 1959), Rabban Aphrem Paulose (arr. 1960, dep. 1964), and Mor Timotheos Aphrem Aboodi (arr. 1965, dep. 1973). Patr. Petros III/IV was the first patriarch to visit India (arr. 1875, dep. 1877) and began a tradition of visits by all subsequent patriarchs with the exception of Patr.<ref type="cr"> Ignatius Afram Barsoum</ref>.</p>
<p>The Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church has today 17 dioceses and more than 600 churches in India and several educational and medical institutions as well as social service organizations. Nearly 80 parishes have been established in North America, Europe, the Persian Gulf, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand. A few of the churches in India are also claimed by the autocephalous Malankara Orthodox Church and are often uneasily shared under court direction or are closed for worship. Since 2002, the Catholicate is at Puthenkurishu, near Kochi. In addition to the Cath. there are 29 bishops. The number of faithful is estimated to be over a million; the vast majority are concentrated in the dioceses of Ankamaly, Kochi (Cochin), Kandanad, and Kottayam — all in central Kerala.</p>
<p>The Cath. of India exercises authority over 15 dioceses as well as institutions under the Malankara Synod which has 17 bishops. Churches of the diaspora outside India are directly under the Patr. but administered by bishops of Indian origin. The Knanaya archdiocese of the ‘Southist’ endogamous community — with its origins from a Mesopotamian emigration, by tradition, dated to 345 — has an archbishop, independent of the Catholicate, with three suffragans, over 70 churches, and a sizeable diaspora in Europe and North America. Since 1920, churches have been established in India directly under the temporal authority of the Patr. and administered by the Patriarchal delegate to Malankara; today these parishes are under a Patriarchal Vicariate called the ‘Simhasana’ (‘Throne’) Churches and Institutions with four bishops including the Patriarchal delegate and about 30 churches. The major monasteries of the Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church at Manjinikkara, Piramadom, and Malekurishu fall under this Vicariate. The Evangelical Association of the East — the missionary arm of the Church, established in 1924 — has three bishops, one of whom presides over the autonomous Honovar St. Antony’s Mission; the Association has about 45 churches, 10 educational institutions, and other charitable organizations. Since 1990, the Seminary of the Church, now headed by a bp., has functioned at Udayagiri where a four year Bachelor’s degree in Theology is offered. The Church has lay organizations for youth, students, women, and Sunday School. The Church has an active laity-sponsored presence on the internet with a number of general as well as parish websites, discussion groups, radio, and TV sites.</p>
<p>The Church curiously retains ‘Jacobite’ in its name, even though the Syr. Orth. Church rejects this appellation as pejorative. Thomas Christians were known as ‘Nazranis’ in the era prior to European influence. The Christians who asserted a Syr. Orth. identity in the 17th  cent. were called the ‘Puthenkoor’ (‘New Allegiance’), but this gave way to the term ‘Jacobite’ under European influence. The term appears to have been adopted without recognizing its negative connotations elsewhere; its continued formal usage results from the distinct historical identity it confers and is encouraged by a popular misconception that it is the antique name of the Church.</p>
<p>Historically, the liturgical language of the Thomas Christians is Syriac. Syr. Orth. liturgies were adopted from Mesopotamia over a long period of time and liturgical practices evolved, progressively conforming to Syr. Orth. traditions, but with notable local adaptations. Malayalam translations of the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> Gospels were first printed in 1811. The first ever print of the Syriac <i>Šḥimo</i> (Simple Prayer) in linotype was published in 1861. The late 19th/early 20th cent. saw the advent of the Syriac <ref type="cr">printing</ref> press and the publication of several liturgical texts in Syriac and Malayalam by V. Rev. Malpan <ref type="cr">Matta Konat</ref> at Mar Julius Press, Pampakuda; these editions became the authorized versions, de facto. The Reformist movement in the 19th cent. prompted worship services in the vernacular Malayalam, although it was only in the early 20th cent. that manuscripts and prints of translations came into vogue. Today, liturgical services are conducted predominantly in Malayalam, although with some remnants of Syriac, primarily in liturgical formulas. Most clergymen today have, at best, a rudimentary knowledge of Syriac. The musical system based on the Beth Gazo has been influenced by various <i>malphone</i> from Mesopotamia, most recently, Mor Yulios Elias Qoro and Rabban ʿAbd al-Aḥad (later Patr. Yaʿqub III); thus the fusion of different Middle Eastern schools of music with local adaptations resulted in a unique musical tradition. However, since the 1970s, secular music influenced by the indigenous Carnatic as well as Western genres has altered liturgical music indiscriminately and, today, the octoechos is known only to the connoisseur. The Malankara Syr. Orth. influence on Syr. Orth. churches across the world is most visible in the liturgical vestments and clothes produced in Kerala, with a distinct style.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>This general title is given to the anonymous saintly protagonist of a narrative set in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> in the 5th cent. The core original story is found in 5 mss. In this account, the Man of God is the son of rich senatorial parents, living either in Rome or Constantinople. On the eve of an advantageous marriage, he boarded a ship and eventually ended up in Edessa. Although sought for, he was not found but, one night, his saintly quality was discovered by the custodian of a church in Edessa. Questioned as to his identity by the custodian, he first identified himself as one of the anonymous poor, but later told his story to the custodian on condition that his identity not be revealed. When the Man of God fell sick, the custodian placed him in a house for strangers. The custodian had to leave the city for a while and, during his absence, the Man of God died and was buried with the poor. Distraught at the news, the custodian besought Bp. <ref type="cr">Rabbula</ref> to help find the saint’s body and give it proper reverence. When they entered the place where the poor were buried, only the clothes of the Man of God were found, not his corpse. Bp. Rabbula promised never to build anything more except hospices for the poor and strangers. The whole story contrasts strongly with other narratives of Syr. saints who performed miracles and prodigious feats of asceticism. A narrative similar to this is found in a Greek ms., but the bp.’s name is not given and details place the story at a later date than Rabbula.</p>
<p>The core Syriac narrative then is continued in the tradition. In this development, the Man of God did not actually die, but left Edessa to escape notice. He returned to his parents’ house and lived in it unbeknownst to them. When he died, his sanctity and identity were miraculously revealed and miracles occurred round his tomb. His parents were given names and, later in the tradition, the Man of God received a name, Alexius. Under this name, the tradition spread widely in the European tradition. His feast day in the Roman church is 17 July.</p>

<Author>R. Doran</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Mani</head><ab type="infobox"/>(216 – ca. 276) 
<p>Founder of a religious movement (Manichaeism). Mani was born in Mesopotamia. Reared in a strict Jewish-Christian baptismal sect, at the age of 12 Mani began to experience revelations from a heavenly being called, ‘The Twin’. At 24, he received a divine calling to be the ‘apostle of light’, the incarnate Paraclete of God, chosen to propagate his ‘lifegiving message’. Due to his frequent travels and bold evangelistic proclamation — and the royal protection of Shapur I (242–72) — Mani converted many people to his religion. Manichaeism was a complex ascetic system based on Zoroastrian dualism, that also included features of Gnostic cosmology, Judaism, Christianity, Buddhism, and Babylonian myth. The practice of Manichaeism allowed for two classes of followers: the ‘elect’, devoted to liberating spiritual particles of light from their material imprisonment through full adherence to the sect’s harsh ascetic rules, and the ‘auditor’, who provided for the needs of the elect and followed a less severe code, in the hope of eventual reincarnation as one of the elect. During the reign of Bahram  I (273–6), the Zoroastrian hierarchy instigated a widespread persecution of minority religions, including Manichaeism. Mani was put to death ca. 276. Nevertheless, Manichaean missionaries continued to attract converts throughout Persia and the Roman empire, into central Asia, where it survived into the Mongol period, and even as far as eastern <ref type="cr">China</ref>. The spread of Manichaeism and its use of Christian elements elicited numerous polemical responses on the part of orthodox Christians. Mani wrote books in <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> and Pahlavi, though only fragments survive. Seeking to promote his universalizing teaching across cultural barriers, he encouraged the translation of Manichaean texts into different languages, for which a distinctive Manichean script, akin to Syriac Esṭrangela, was devised. Manichaean texts were eventually disseminated in a wide variety of languages.</p>

<p>Bp. and scholar. He was born in Baqufa and given the baptismal name Yawsep. After his education at the Patriarchal Seminary in Mosul he was ordained priest by Patr. Eliya XIV on 15 Aug. 1889. From 1895–1902 he was head of the <ref type="cr">Seminary of St. John</ref> in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, and was also involved with the Dominican Press. In 1902 he accompanied Patr.

He had hoped to go to Rome in 1928, but on Holy Thursday he mysteriously disappeared; his body was eventually found in the Tigris. Having an excellent knowledge of Syriac, he published a grammar (Mosul, 1896) and Syriac-Arabic dictionary (1900); the latter was re-issued with an appendix in Beirut (ed. R. J. Bidawid, 1975). His two-volume anthology of Syriac literature, <i>Marge pegyānāye d-mardutā d-Ārāmāye </i><i>/Morceaux choisis de littérature araméenne</i> (1901) has been much appreciated.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The foundation of Syriac studies is the ms. production of past ages. A body of perhaps ten thousand Syriac mss. survives today. But any discussion of Syriac literature must recall that whole categories of mss. (for example, those containing works on medicine and other secular subjects) have not been preserved, and even many religious works (e.g. doctrinally suspect works, and commentaries superseded by more comprehensive ones) perished because they were copied only rarely or not at all.</p>
<p>1. The oldest mss. Although Syriac is well attested in <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref> in the 1st–4th cent., only three mss. are known, all legal documents from Osrhoene, with dates 240, 242, 243. These are written on parchment in a cursive script akin to the later Serṭo book-hand (see <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Documents</ref>).</p>
<p>2. 5th–10th cent. Surviving literary mss. go back to the 5th cent., including the earliest dated codex in any language, a large ms. of ecclesiastical texts translated from Greek, written in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> in 411 (ms. Brit. Lib. Add. 12,150). Generally, Syriac mss. at this period are codices (not rolls), written in quires of 10 leaves of parchment (not paper), with writing in 1, 2, or occasionally 3 columns, in the Esṭrangela script. Early mss. include many examples of fine professional calligraphy. The Serṭo script is found in a ms. dated 790 (Brit. Lib. Add. 14,158), and thereafter it gradually took over as the normal book-hand in W. Syr. mss. except in books used in churches for public reading and singing. Most of the mss. that survive from this period come from the library of <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in Egypt, where they were brought from Mesopotamia by the abbot <ref type="cr">Mushe of Nisibis</ref> in 931/2. Some of this collection was acquired by the Vatican Library in 1707 and 1715, and almost all the rest of it by the British Museum in 1841–51. The other significant old collection of mss., including Melk. ones, is at the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref> on Mt. Sinai.</p>
<p>3. Later W.-Syr. mss. The earliest known Syriac ms. on paper is dated 932. Paper mss. are the norm after the 10th cent., apart from a revival of Esṭrangela writing on parchment that was centered in <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> in the 12th–13th cent. Mss. in the Serṭo script from the 13th to the 18th cent. are only rarely calligraphic. In modern times, fine writing in the Serṭo script has again been cultivated by such penmen as Mattai bar Pawlos of Mosul (d. 1947) and Mar <ref type="cr">Julius Çiçek</ref> (1941–2005), the latter of whom, however, wrote his mss. for reproduction in print as an alternative to typesetting.</p>
<p>4. E.-Syr. mss. The E.-Syr. church had no counterpart to Mushe of Nisibis. Consequently, early E.-Syr. mss. are rare, and often works of E.-Syr. authors are preserved in only a single old ms. or copy thereof. Palaeographically, E.-Syr. scribes were conservative, and a distinctive E.-Syr. script appears only in the ca. 14th cent. From the 16th cent. on, however, we have a large number of 
E.-Syr. mss. from N. Iraq, many the work of copyists from the Shikwānā and Nasro families of <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref>. In the 19th cent. more mss. were copied in this area and in 
<ref type="cr">Urmia</ref> for western scholars and collectors.</p>
<p>5. Present-day collections. Besides the afore-mentioned ones in London, Rome, and Mt. Sinai, there are significant collections of medieval mss. in Europe at the Bibliothèque nationale de France; Oxford, Cambridge, and Birmingham Universities (the last of these deriving from <ref type="cr">Alphonse Mingana</ref>); the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin (deriving from <ref type="cr">Eduard Sachau</ref>); and in the USA at Harvard University (deriving from <ref type="cr">J. R. Harris</ref>). These collections all have printed, and in some cases on-line, catalogues. In the Middle East, several important collections were destroyed or dislocated in the First World War. For the disposition of mss. today it is necessary to consult Desreumaux (1991), and even since that publication some movement has taken place. The largest collection of W.-Syr. mss. is at the Syr. Orth. seminary at Maʿarrat Ṣaydnāyā, <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>, Syria. The Syr. Cath. Patriarchate in <ref type="cr">Sharfeh</ref>, Lebanon, also has a significant collection. Most E.-Syr. mss. in Iraq have been consolidated by the Chald. Church at the Patriarchate in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>, a smaller number also by the Ch. of E. Archbishopric there. The richest library of Syriac mss. in India is at Pampakuda.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The Syriac word <i>maphryono</i> (<i>mpryn</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ) literally signifies ‘one who bears fruit’, metaphorically a ‘consecrator’. The Anglicized term Maphrian derives from the Arabic form <i>mafiryān</i>. The term is synonymous with the term ‘Catholicos’. It is used to designate the prelate who holds the second rank after the Patr. in the Syr. Orth. Church. Three Maphrianate lines are known:</p>
<p>1. Maphrianate of <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref>, also known as the Maphrianate of the East. It was established in the 7th cent. in order to give the <ref type="cr">Miaphysite</ref> Syr. Orth. a hierarchy structure in the Persian empire. The first Maphrian (though the title was fixed at an unknown date later) was <ref type="cr">Marutha of Tagrit</ref>, from 628–49, who was consecrated by Patr. <ref type="cr">Athanasios Gamolo</ref>. The Maphrian, when consecrated by the <ref type="cr">Patr. of Antioch</ref>, had autonomy and was the sole ruler of the Syr. Orth. churches in Persia. He had the right to consecrate and appoint bishops, and to consecrate the <ref type="cr">chrism</ref>, but had to refer to the Patriarch for moving a bp. from one diocese to another. This arrangement continued even after the fall of the Sasanian Empire soon after. In 869 and again during the patriarchate of <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon X bar Shushan</ref> it was decided that just as the patriarch consecrated the Maphrian so the Maphrian consecrates a new patriarch. For the first time in 1222, the incumbent Maphrian <ref type="cr">Ignatius Dawid</ref> became Patr. Thirteen Maphrians later became patriarchs at various times. In 1074 <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> was added to the Maphrianate, and in 1089, after the destruction of <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref> by the Muslims, the Maphrianate moved to <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> during the Maphrianate of Yuḥanon Ṣliba. His successor, <ref type="cr">Dionysios Mushe</ref>, managed to return to <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref> until 1152 or 1155, after which the Maphrians resided in <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>. Until the 11th cent., the Maphrians were almost exclusively from the East, but later bishops from the West were consecrated and sent to the East. The last Maphrian of this line was Baselius Behnam IV (1839–59). After his death, the Maphrianate, by now titular only, was abolished.</p>
<p>2. Maphrianate of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>. This Maphrianate was under the jurisdiction of the <ref type="cr">Patriarchate of Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>. The first Maphrian was <ref type="cr">Baselios Malki</ref> of <ref type="cr">Midyat</ref> who was consecrated by Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius Masʿūd II of Zaz</ref> in 1495. It is not clear to what extent the Maphrian held jurisdiction within Ṭur ʿAbdin. The last of the Maphrians of this line was <ref type="cr">Baselios</ref> ʿAbd al-Aḥad<ref type="cr"> of Anhil</ref> (1821–1844) who was killed by Kurds in March 1844.</p>
<p>3. Maphrianate in India. The establishment of the Maphrianate in <ref type="cr">Malankara</ref> is intermingled with much controversy. The <ref type="cr">Malankara Metropolitan Dionesios Yawsep</ref> requested its formation from Patr. Peṭros IV in 1875–77, and repeated the request from his successor Patr. <ref type="cr">ʿAbdulmasīḥ II</ref> around 1902, but the latter strongly refused. After ʿAbdulmasīḥ II was deposed and replaced by ʿ<ref type="cr">Abdullāh II</ref>, the request was made again by the next <ref type="cr">Malankara Metropolitan Dionysios Giwargis</ref> from ʿAbdullāh II. By this time, there existed in India two parties, a <ref type="cr">patriarchal faction</ref> which desired to remain under the jurisdiction of the Patr., and a <ref type="cr">metropolitan faction</ref> which called for an autonomous and sometimes autocephalous church. In 1912, the deposed ʿAbdulmasīḥ II consecrated <ref type="cr">Baselios Pawlos I</ref> of the <ref type="cr">metropolitan faction</ref> as Maphrian. <ref type="cr">Pawlos I</ref> was succeeded by other local Maphrians consecrated by bishops of the same faction. The Patriarch and his faction did not recognize the Maphrianate. In 1958, both parties came together and Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius Yaʿqub III</ref> recognized the incumbent Maphrian. In 1964, the Patr. himself consecrated the next Maphrian, <ref type="cr">Baselios Augen I</ref> for both parties. The peace was short lived, and by 1975 the situation deteriorated. Yaʿqub<ref type="cr"> III</ref> withdrew recognition of the Maphrian and consecrated in his stead <ref type="cr">Baselios Paulose II</ref> from the <ref type="cr">patriarchal faction</ref>. Since then, two lines of Maphrians exist in India.</p>
<p>4. At least one Syr. Catholic Maphrian is known, Baselios Isḥaq Jbeir who became a Maphrian in 1693. 
A formal line of the Maphrianate, however, did not exist.</p>

<p>The Mar Thoma Church is that section of the non-Roman St. <ref type="cr">Thomas Christians</ref> which has undertaken a degree of liturgical and doctrinal reform under the influence of Church of England missionaries in the 19th cent.</p>
<p>The arrival of British administrators and Churchmen in early 19th-cent. Kerala coincided with a desire for improved training for clergy. With the encouragement of the British Resident, Colonel Munro, a College was founded at Kottayam under Indian auspices, though it was soon dominated by missionaries of the Anglican Church Missionary Society who arrived in 1816. Under their influence Palakunnathu Abraham, a <i>Malpan</i> from Maramon, agitated for the removal of some liturgical and cultural practices. Abraham was simultaneously genuinely committed to W.-Syr. identity, including the use of Serṭo script, which rapidly replaced E.-Syr. while he was teaching at the College.</p>
<p>Various factions in the community appealed to the Syr. Orth. Patr. at <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>, who, in 1842, consecrated a nephew of Abraham Malpan as Mathews Mar Athanasios. His pursuit of reform was inconsistent. He continued as Malankara Metropolitan until his death in 1877, though in the preceding year Patr. Peṭros III had divided Kerala into seven Dioceses for those who wished to live under his jurisdiction. After a decade of litigation, a Court ruling in 1889 declared that Toma Mar Athanasios (successor to Mathews Mar Athanasios) was not Malankara Metropolitan as he had not been consecrated by a Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. The ‘Reformers’ were required to leave the ancient Churches and erect new buildings. They took the name ‘Mar Thoma Syrian Church’.</p>
<p>There was a crisis in 1893 when Toma Mar Athanasios died without having consecrated a successor. Recourse was had to the <ref type="cr">Malabar Independent Syrian Church</ref>, whose bishops travelled to Kottayam in the face of many threats and consecrated a son of Abraham Malpan with the title Titus Mar Thoma. Since then, Thozhiyur bishops have actively participated at every Mar Thoma consecration, thus enabling that Church to remain sacramentally connected to its Oriental Orthodox heritage. On five occasions in the 20th cent. Mar Thoma Metropolitans have consecrated bishops for Thozhiyur.</p>
<p>The ‘agenda’ of the reform was very much determined by the issues which had dominated the English Reformation in the 16th cent.: prayer and the departed, the invocation of saints, eucharistic Presence. The first two were deleted from liturgical practice. With regard to the third, the Mar Thoma anaphoral epiclesis still prays that the Holy Spirit will ‘sanctify this Bread that it may be the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ’ (with a parallel petition over the Cup), though prayer addressed to the Sacramental Christ is omitted. Phrases which Anglican influence suggested were capable of a ‘monophysite’ interpretation were also amended. Only the Councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, and Ephesus are commemorated in the Qurbānā.</p>
<p>The form of the Church’s worship remains unmistakably Syr. Orth. The vestments, church furnishings, chanting, use of incense, and the general dynamics of worship mark it as a Church in the Oriental Orthodox tradition. Its bishops are celibates, distinguished by the monastic <i>schema</i>. They are buried seated in their robes. Beards are optional for priests, but are worn by many (all bishops have them). The white cassock is universal. Most worship is now in Malayalam, though some Syriac formulae remain in use. English and other languages are increasingly used outside India.</p>
<p>The Church has always had a strong commitment to fostering the spiritual life of its members. In the 1880s it inaugurated the world-famous Maramon Convention. Domestic prayer and Bible reading are encouraged. Ashrams and, more recently, a celibate order of priests have been instituted. The Church has several evangelistic missions throughout India, but has not yet applied its evangelistic zeal to any great extent in the ­Diaspora. There is a long tradition of close relations with the Church of South India and the Church of North India, though the Mar Thoma Church has said that it does not wish to abandon its eastern heritage by uniting with the two western-derived Churches. The Church is actively involved in the World Council of Churches and other ecumenical bodies.</p>
<p>Theological training remains Western in form. Whereas the <ref type="cr">Malabar Catholic Church</ref> has engaged in an active debate about freeing itself from colonially-imposed theological method and rediscovering its Eastern roots, the Mar Thoma Church has not yet ventured upon that process.</p>
<p>The Church today has approximately 1 million members worldwide, under the oversight of ten bishops. The bishops constitute the episcopal synod, presided over by the most senior, who is Metropolitan. The supreme governing body is the <i>Sabha Mandalam</i>, which has over a thousand clergy and lay representatives from all the congregations worldwide, and meets annually.</p>

<Author>J. R. K. Fenwick</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Mara bar Serapion, Letter of</head><ab type="infobox"/>(2nd or 4th cent.?) 
<p>Mara is the presumed author of a letter in which a father gives lessons of wisdom to his son, from whom he is separated. Having been led captive, along with others, from his home town of Samosata, ca. 50 km. north of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, Mara is not allowed by the Romans to return. His lessons have a stoic ring, warning against worldly possessions, and encouraging his son to seek true wisdom and freedom. Although the examples are mostly taken from Greek culture, there also is mention of ‘the wise king’ of the Jews, after whose death (unfortunately the text is not in order here) their kingdom was taken away from them in punishment, while the new laws that he established live on. This generally has been understood as a reference to Jesus. The author thus presents himself as a pagan who has outsider knowledge of Judaism and some appreciation of Christianity.</p>
<p>If the letter has a historical basis, it most likely dates from the period prior to 190 or 160, when the Roman Empire still was in the process of establishing its power over Osrhoene and Mesopotamia. In a recent study (which includes Syr. and ET), Merz, Rensberger, and Tieleman argue that the letter reflects the historical situation of the early 70s, when Rome first gained control of Samosata. According to a very different reading, however, first proposed by McVey, the letter might be either a rhetorical school exercise or a Christian apologetic document pointing out positive values of Christianity to educated pagans. While the Christian references are more marginal than one would expect in an apologetic text, viewing the letter as a school exercise helps understand the poignant anecdote at the end, which is recognizable as a ‘chreia’, a pregnant sentence described in late ancient rhetorical handbooks. Some archaic elements in the language of the letter, which most likely originally was written in Syriac, support an early date, no later than the 4th cent.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Marcion</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. ca. 160)
<p>Early Christian thinker, founder of the Marcionites. Marcion was born in Sinope on the southern shore of the Black Sea in Asia Minor. In ca. 140 he traveled to Rome, where in 144 he was excommunicated by the Christian Church and he subsequently founded his own church. A great number of Christian authors, both in the East and the West, wrote against Marcion and his followers, which may be seen as an indication of his influence and of the threat he posed to (what later would develop into) orthodox Christianity. Since none of Marcion’s writings have survived, his teaching must be reconstructed from patristic refutations. Marcion drastically differed from mainstream Christianity in his rejection of the OT. In his view, the God of the OT, who was the creator of the material world (which was seen as evil) and the protagonist in OT history, was not the same as the God whom Jesus Christ revealed in the NT. The OT God, even though he was just, was inferior to the perfect, yet hidden God of grace of the NT. The OT, therefore, was irrelevant to Christians, even though Marcion did not deny its validity for the Jews. Based on these insights, Marcion created his own canon of scripture, which consisted of one Gospel (mainly based on Luke) and a collection of ten expurgated Pauline epistles. Marcion’s views and canon formation had a significant impact on the development of nascent orthodox Christianity.</p>
<p>Marcion’s followers reached Syria and <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> by the end of the 2nd cent. According to <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref> (Ecclesiastical History, 5,13), <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref> composed dialogues against the Marcionites (which are not preserved), and the ‘Book of the laws of the countries’ contains anti-Marcionite polemics, albeit without naming Marcion. In the 4th<sup></sup>cent., <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> attacked the Marcionites in several of his works. These sometimes strident attacks suggest that the Marcionites represented a serious threat in his day. Moreover, Ephrem established a genealogical link between Marcion, the arch-heretic, and the later heretics Bardaiṣan and <ref type="cr">Mani</ref>. Ephrem’s most systematic refutation of Marcion can be found in the collection of writings known as the ‘Prose Refutations’. Another anti-Marcionite treatise of Syriac origin survives in an Armenian translation and mainly deals with the parables of the Gospel and their OT antecedents. The Syriac original of this work may be traced back to the (early?) 4th cent., but contrary to the view of the most recent editor (Egan), Ephrem should not be seen as its author (see Outtier and Bundy).</p>
<p>While the significance of Marcion and his movement in the early period of Syriac Christianity has been widely recognized since the days of W. Bauer, it is unclear how long the Marcionites had their own ecclesiastical institutions in the Syriac world. A remarkable episode in the ‘Life of Mar <ref type="cr">Aba</ref>’ (ed. Bedjan) suggests that in mid-6th cent. Mesopotamia Marcionites still had a significant presence and were called <i>kresṭyāne</i>, as opposed to mainstream Christians who were called <i>mš</i><i>iḥāye</i>.</p>

<p>City in upper Mesopotamia and important center of Syriac Christianity, especially for the Syr. Orth. Church as the city closest to <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>, the seat of the patr. from 1293 until 1932. Despite its strategic location overlooking the plain to the south at the point where the road from <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> to <ref type="cr">Amid</ref> enters the mountains, Mardin seems to have been of relatively little importance in Roman and Byzantine times. In Islamic times, it was the seat of a line of Artuqids from 1108/9 until 1408. Administrative center of a district (<i>sancak</i>) within the province (<i>vilayet</i>) of Diyarbakır in late Ottoman times, Mardin is today the capital of the province of the same name in the Republic of Turkey.</p>
<p>Barsoum mentions as the first bp. of Mardin a certain Christopher named in the Life of Mor Abḥai. Historically more certain is Daniel ʿUzoyo, abbot of Qarṭmin (see <ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref>), who was made metropolitan of Tella, Mardin, Dara, and <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> in 614/5. Until the 12th cent., the see of Mardin was frequently joined with that of Kfartuto, apparently with residence at first (until 8th cent.?) in Kfartuto and later in Mardin. In the schism that followed the death of Patr. Philoxenos Nemrod in 1292, Ignatius bar Wahib (patr. 1293–1333) became the first in the line of patriarchs who resided regularly in Mardin and Dayr al-Zaʿfarān. Following the death of <ref type="cr">Philoxenos Yuḥanon Dolabani</ref> in 1969, the see remained vacant and was administered by patriarchal vicars until the appointment of Philoxenos Saliba Özmen in 2003.</p>
<p>Mardin was also an important center of the Syr. Catholic movement and was, along with <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>, a regular place of residence for the Syr. Catholic patriarchs from 1853, when Metr. Yūliyūs Anṭūn Samḥīrī of Mardin was elevated to the patriarchate, until the First World War.</p>
<p>The presence of E.-Syr. Christians in Mardin is suggested by the inclusion of ‘Mardin’ in the titles of bishops of Maypherqaṭ from the 12th cent. onwards. The first 
E.-Syr. bp. specifically for Mardin seems to be the Chald. Ḥenanishoʿ consecrated after the schism of 1552. The scholar-bp. Yoḥannan Eliya Mellus (1831–1908, metr. of Mardin since 1890) left an important collection of mss. at the Chald. episcopal residence. The Chald. see of Mardin lapsed with the death of Israel Audo (metr. 1914–41).</p>
<p>In 1913, Tfinkdji estimated the Christian population of Mardin at 20,000 out of a total population of 50,000, with 6,500 Armenian Catholics, 7,000 Syr. Orth., 1,750 Syr. Catholics, 1,100 Chald. and 120 Protestants. In 2005, there were reported to be 75 Syr. Orth., 7 Syr. Catholic, and 2 Armenian families as well as 1 Chald. family.</p>
<p>The following churches are to be found today or are known to have existed in the past in Mardin. Syr. Orth.: 1. Forty Martyrs (in Şar Quarter, west of Cumhuriyet Square, formerly Mor Behnam and Sara, 5/6th cent., principal church of Syr. Orth. community with former patriarchal apartments); 2. Mor Mikayel (south of town, on the site of martyrdom of Michael and his sister, 5th  cent.?); 3. Mort Shmuni (in Teker Quarter in eastern part of old city, 6th cent.?); 4. Mor Peṭros and Pawlos (in Gül Quarter near eastern end of old city, 1914.); 
5. Yoldat Aloho (in Savur Gate Quarter near eastern end of old city, 1857, sold in 1953). Syr. Catholic: 1. Yoldat Aloho (Immaculate Conception, on Cumhuriyet Square, 1860; the adjacent former patriarchate, built in 1895, is now a municipal museum); 2. Mor Ephrem Monastery (in Diyarbakır Gate Quarter at western end of old city, 1884). Chald.: 1. Mar Hormizd (east of Cumhuriyet Square, 430). Others: 1. St. George (Surp Kevork, former Armenian Catholic cathedral, 420); 2. St. Joseph (Surp Hovsep, Armenian Catholic, 1894); 3. St. Barbara (Armenian Catholic monastery, demolished); 4. ‘Patriye Kilisesi’ (Latin [Capuchin], 1884, demolished); 5. Protestant (demolished); 6. former Forty Martyrs (converted to mosque in 1170, now Şehidiye Mosque); 7. former Mor Yuḥanon (Syr. Orth., converted to mosque in 1950’s, now Zeyt Mosque); 8. former Mor Tumo (now Ulu Cami?).</p>
<p>Of the 94 mss. at the Chald. episcopal residence described by A. Scher in 1908, sixteen were donated to the Vatican by Israel Audo, but most of the remainder are believed still to be in Mardin, along with a good number of mss. transferred there from Amid. An important collection of mss. is also to be found at the Syr. Orth. Church of the Forty Martyrs.</p>

<p>The Acts of Mari, which date from the late 6th or 7th  cent., provide an account of the earliest preaching of the Gospel in the Parthian/Persian Empire. Mari, a disciple of Addai, is sent to preach in ‘the region of Babel’; starting from <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> his travels are said to have taken him to <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, Arzanene, Beth Zabdai, <ref type="cr">Beth</ref> ʿ<ref type="cr">Arbaye</ref>, <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>, Athor, and <ref type="cr">Nineveh</ref>, continuing on southwards to <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>, <ref type="cr">Beth Aramaye</ref>, <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, ending up in Dayra d-Qunni, where he died. Very probably the Acts of Mari were produced in the Dayra d-Qunni, which became famous in the early Islamic period. It is possible that the account of Mari’s travels was also intended to act as a counterpart to that of the missionary travels of <ref type="cr">Mani</ref>. Other sources on Mari, notably <ref type="cr">Bar</ref> ʿ<ref type="cr">Ebroyo</ref> (Ecclesiastical History II, 3) and the ‘Book of the Tower’, limit Mari’s preaching to Babylonia. The Acts, which clearly know the ‘<ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref>’, are probably the earliest source to refer to the impression of Christ’s face left on a cloth (<i>sindon</i>, the term also found in the Greek Acts of Thaddaeus, whose date is disputed; in the Teaching of Addai his portrait is painted).</p>

<p>Greek monastic author of uncertain identity. He is said to have been a disciple of St. <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref> and to have lived in Galatia, perhaps also spending some time in the desert of Judaea, though his identity and date remain very uncertain (thus it has also been suggested that he was another person of that name, from Tarsus, with whom <ref type="cr">Severus</ref> corresponded; this would put him a century later). His Greek writings are now available in a good edition (G.-M. de Durand, in SC 445, 455 [1999, 2000]); most of these were translated into Syriac (where the oldest ms., dated 533/4 calls him ‘Mark the Egyptian Solitary’). His writings were evidently quite widely read in E.-Syr. monastic circles; further testimony to their popularity is the existence of commentary on his ‘On the Spiritual Law’ (<i>CPG</i> 6090), by <ref type="cr">Babai</ref> the Great (died 628). None of the Syriac translations have yet been edited. Arabic versions of several of the works were made from Syriac (ed. I. A. Khalifé, in <i>MUSJ</i>28 [1949–50], 117–224).</p>

<p>Said to be located on the site of the Last Supper and named after the Evangelist, the monastery is situated on mount Zion in <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>. Mention of the ‘House of Mark’ appears in the 9th cent. in the writings of <ref type="cr">Iwannis of Dara</ref>. An inscription, discovered in 1940, reads ‘This is the house of Mary, the Mother of John who was called Mark. And it was proclaimed a church by the Holy Apostles in the name of the Mother of God, Mary, after the Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ into heaven. It was built a second time after Jerusalem was destroyed at the hands of King Titus the year 73 of Christ’. The dating in the inscription is peculiar as one would expect a Seleucid calendar date, not a Christian one. Afram Barsoum dated the inscription to the 6th  cent. on paleographical grounds, while later scholars assign it to after the Monastery was acquired by the Syr. Orth. in the 15th cent. A monastery in the name of the Mother of God was purchased from the Copts in 1471/2, before which the Syr. Orth. had owned other properties in the city. Kaufhold identified this monastery with St. Mark’s based on a note in the 17th cent. ms. London, Brit. Libr. Egerton 704 which was written in the ‘Holy Monastery of the Mother of God, called the House of Mark’, and ordination lists from the 18th cent. It was around the late 1400s that St. Mark’s became the seat of the Syr. Orth. bp. of Jerusalem. The monastery was renovated a number of times, the earliest known renovation being in 1718 by Gregorios Shimʿun of Ṣalaḥ, followed by another renovation by his successor Gregorios ʿAbd al-Aḥad b. Fanna of <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>. Other renovations took place during 1738–44 by Gregorios Jirjis Fattal of <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>, during 1780–92 by Gregorios Bshara, and during 1833–40 by Gregorios ʿAbd al-Aḥad Dajjala. The last two renovations from the 19th cent. were done by Ostethewos ʿAbd al-Nūr of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> during 1840–77, and Gregorios Jirjis of Ṣadad in 1882. The monastery’s library includes a fine collection of mss., ca. 15 of which date from the 7th to the 15th cent. The library itself was established probably in the 16th or 17th cent., and the early mss. must have been brought from other monasteries in the city, especially from the Monastery of Mary Magdalene, and elsewhere. Some of the mss. of <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> were transferred to it after World War I. In turn, some of its mss. were transferred by Patr. <ref type="cr">Afram  I Barsoum</ref> to the Patriarchate in <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref> prior to the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, and later to <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>. A few of the mss. were brought by <ref type="cr">Athanasios Yeshuʿ Samuel</ref> to the USA in 1948 and are kept now at St. Mark’s Cathedral, Teaneck, NJ. A catalog of the library was compiled by Dolabani. The monastery became famous with the first publication of the discoveries of the Dead Sea Scrolls titled <i>The</i> <i>Dead Sea Scrolls of St. Mark’s Monastery</i>. In addition to the main church inside the monastery, dedicated to St. Mark, there is an adjacent chapel dedicated to Mar Behnam.</p>

<p>St. Maron, a charsimatic hermit who lived in the region of the Orontes River valley toward the end of the 4th cent., is venerated as the Father of the Syr. Maron. Church of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. Few historical details of his life can be ascertained. According to <ref type="cr">Theodoret</ref>, bp. of Cyrrhus, St. Maron distinguished himself by a life lived in the open air without shelter. He survived on a frugal diet of wild plants and herbs. It is generally accepted that he is the addressee of a letter of <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref> written to ‘Maron, monk, and hermit’. Maron’s sanctity and spiritual gifts attracted other ascetics as well as simple believers. Together they formed what was known in antiquity as <i>Bayt Maroon</i> ‘The House of Maron’. The monastery of St. Maron became identified with its defense of the Christological formulation of the Council of Chalcedon (451) which defined two natures in Christ, divine and human. Following the Arab expansion and the relocation of the Chalcedonian patr. from Antioch to Constantinople, the Maronites withdrew to the mountainous region of northern Lebanon where, around 685, they elected a patr., <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon Maron</ref>, and constituted themselves as an indigenous Syriac-speaking Chalcedonian community. The Maronite Church celebrates the feast of its namesake and spiritual Father on 9 Feb.</p>

<Author>J. P. Amar</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Maronite Church
</LemmaTitle><p>The Syriac Maronite Church of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> is an eastern Catholic community of Syriac Antiochene origin with no Orthodox counterpart. Its origins are traced to the late 4th cent. when Syriac-speaking Christians between <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> and Antioch gathered around a charismatic monk, <ref type="cr">St. Maron</ref>. In the 5th cent. the community became identified with its defense of the Christological formulation of the Council of Chalcedon (451). Liturgically, the Maronite Church represents an independent branch of the Edessan tradition developed by Syriac-speaking Chalcedonians who established themselves independently of the Greek-speaking Mediterranean coast.</p>
<p>With the Muslim Arab expansion of the 7th cent., the Maronites took refuge in the mountains of northern Lebanon where they lived in relative isolation and assumed a distinct identity. This allowed the Maronite Church to preserve its Syriac identity while other Syriac-speaking Chalcedonians eventually adopted Byzantine liturgical usage. As a result of the absence of a Chalcedonian Patr. of Antioch, late in the 7th cent. the monks of the monastery of St. Maron elected a Patr., St. <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon Maron</ref>, who assumed the title ‘Syriac Maronite Patriarch of Antioch and All the East’. Since 1790 the Patr. has resided at Bkerke near <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>.</p>
<p>With the coming of the Crusaders to the Levant, contact with the West was established and relations with Rome were strengthened. While this helped secure the survival of the Maronite Church in the Muslim Middle East, it also inaugurated the process of Latinization that began in the 13th cent. and that continued through modern times. The legislation of the Council of Trent (1545–63) and Latin liturgical customs were introduced into Maronite usage. In 1583 a Maronite College was founded in Rome and played an important role in fostering the study of the East in Europe. In 1736 the Synod of Mount Lebanon was convened under Papal aegis; the Synod radically altered the liturgical and canonical life of the Maronite Church by formalizing and codifying centuries of Latinizing influence into law. This Romanizing tendency persisted until the Second Vatican Council (1962–5) mandated that all eastern churches begin a process of renewal that would return them to the authentic expression of their cultural, spiritual, and liturgical roots. As a result, over the past fifty years the Maronites have eliminated many Latinizing customs and have restored authentic Syriac Maronite usage.</p>
<p>In modern times the Maronite Church has experienced a revival of its ancient monastic origins in the form of a return by some monks to the anchoritic or secluded ascetical lifestyle. In addition to Maronite eparchies (dioceses) in Lebanon and throughout the Middle East, eparchies now exist in the USA, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, and Canada.</p>

<Author>J. P. Amar</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Martyrs and persecutions
</LemmaTitle><p>Times of persecution and of martyrdom fall into four main periods: 1. early 4th cent. (and again under Julian, 361–3), within the Roman Empire (i.e. approximately Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine); 2. mid-4th to mid-7th cent., in the Persian (Sasanian) Empire (approximately modern Iraq and Iran); 3. under Arab rule; and 4. under Ottoman rule and in modern times. It is only from the first two periods that sizeable collections of ‘Martyr Acts’ in Syriac are available. From both a literary and a historical point of view these works can vary enormously in character: a few are brief factual reports made more or less at the time; many more are later literary reworkings which, even though they may sometimes be based on reliable sources, have introduced imaginary dialogues between persecutor and persecuted whose aim is to edify and give encouragement to those who read or hear them; miraculous elements also tend to appear. In other martyr acts the miraculous takes over on a large scale and they take on an epic character.</p>
<p>Two groups of Syriac Martyr Acts from the Roman Empire are of especial importance: <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref>’s Palestinian Martyrs, whose complete form survives only in Syriac translation, and the various martyrdoms associated with <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>.</p>
<p>The Edessene martyrdoms fall into two distinct categories, historical and legendary. The former concern the deacon Ḥabib and the laymen Shmona and Gurya, who were martyred probably in 309 and 310; all three came from villages around Edessa, but met their death in Edessa. Although the accounts have been embellished with dialogues and miraculous elements, it is likely that the basic information given is reasonably reliable. This cannot be said concerning two other Edessan martyrdoms, the Acts of Sharbel and those of Barsamya, which purport to be contemporary accounts of events that took place under Trajan in 105: both can be shown to be fictional accounts put out in the first half of the 5th cent. by circles in Edessa which also produced the <ref type="cr">Teaching of Adda</ref>i and the legend of the city’s conversion.</p>
<p>Outside the Roman Empire it appears that there was no persecution of Christians under the Parthian dynasty, which came to an end in 226. Under the Sasanians (224–651) serious persecution first arose only after Constantine and his successors had adopted Christianity; it is significant that most of the outbreaks in the 4th and 5th cent. were at times of war with the Roman Empire. The persecution of the 340s under Shapur II was the most widespread, and produced a large number of martyr acts, of varying historical reliability. <ref type="cr">Shemʿon bar Ṣabbaʿe</ref>, bp. of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> (which was beginning to emerge as the patriarchal see) was one of the first to be put to death (probably in 344). The persecution extended to villages as well as to towns and included lay people as well as clergy. Knowledge of these Persian martyrdoms reached the Roman Empire by means of Greek translations and Sozomen’s account in his Ecclesiastical History (II.9–14), as well as by word of mouth. A list of these martyrs was given at the end of a ms. written in Edessa in November 411 (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150).</p>
<p>Subsequent persecutions again occurred in ca. 420 (at the end of the reign of Yazdgard I and beginning of that of Bahram V), and ca. 445 (under Yazdgard II), but on a much smaller scale; both were at times of hostilities with the Roman Empire. Several accounts of the martyrdoms during these persecutions survive, especially for the former (some of these are by a certain <ref type="cr">Abgar</ref>; there is also an account in <ref type="cr">Theodoret</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History, V, 39). Martyrdoms continue to occur down to the end of the Sasanian Empire, but after the middle of the 5th cent. they are almost all confined to isolated cases of converts from Zoroastrianism of noble birth. Several long accounts of these, often of great historical interest, survive in both Syriac and Greek; these include the Acts of Grigor (who managed to become a general after his conversion, but was eventually martyred in 542), the learned Cath. <ref type="cr">Aba</ref> (540–552), two women martyrs, Shirin (558/9) and Golindush/Mary (591), Giwargis (George) and his sister Mary (613), Ishoʿsabran (620), and Mogundat/Anastasius (628) whose martyr acts enjoyed great popularity in Greek and Latin.</p>
<p>The earliest and most detailed information about persecution and martyrdoms in <ref type="cr">Nagran</ref>, in the South Arabian kingdom of <ref type="cr">Ḥimyar</ref>, comes from three related Syriac texts, one of which is a Letter by <ref type="cr">Shemʿun of Beth Arsham</ref> written in 524, while subsequent Martyr Acts are in Greek, Ethiopic, and other languages. The date of the persecution is not certain: 518, 522, and 523 are the possibilities.</p>
<p>Several Martyr Acts survive from the early centuries of Arab rule, though only a very few are written in Syriac, and these are incorporated into Chronicles. Under the Umayyads there were only isolated martyrdoms and the majority of martyrdoms took place under the early Abbasids, in particular during the caliphates of al-Manṣūr (754–75) and al-Mahdī (775–85). Those martyred fall into a number of different categories. Christian Arabs in particular were under considerable pressure to convert to Islam, and a number of those who resisted were put to death. Muslim converts to Christianity, and Christians who had converted to Islam and then returned to Christianity were in especial danger of martyrdom, and among the latter category there are cases of Christians who had been captured as children and then been brought up as Muslims, but who subsequently decided to return to their original faith. Prisoners of war were sometimes forced to apostasize, and those who refused were put to death (in some cases this was a matter of reprisals). Non-Arab Christians living under Arab rule were (at least in the earlier period) in less danger of suffering persecution and martyrdom unless they openly provoked the authorities. In the following centuries persecution tended to be intermittent and local, though none the less dire; this was especially the case under the Mongol ruler Timur Lang (Timurlane) in the 14th cent.</p>
<p>Although later centuries (both under Ottoman rule and more recently, in the 20th and 21st cent.) have witnessed periods of persecution with many martyrdoms in the Syriac and other Churches of the Middle East, the genre of Martyr Acts seems to have largely died out in languages other than in Greek (for which the <i>Neon Martyrologion</i> provides many examples from the Ottoman period). A notable martyr of this period was <ref type="cr">Shemʿun II,</ref>Mafryono of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> (1740). Records, if they exist, of massacres and martyrdoms are primarily to be found in the course of historical accounts and in poetry; this applies in particular to the appalling massacres of 1895/6 and 1915 (<ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref>, the year of the ‘Sword’), when all the Syriac communities suffered immense losses, as well as the Armenians. Many of the victims were killed specifically because they refused to deny their faith.</p>

<p>Bp., doctor, and co-convenor of the Synod of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> (410). There are several late sources for his life in Armenian (ed. Marcus), Greek (ed. J. Noret, in <i>AB</i>91 [1973], 77–103), and Arabic (Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>, chap. 66; Yaqut, under ‘Mayyafariqin’; Ibn al-Azraq); probably all go back to lost Syriac sources. Son of a local governor, he evidently trained as a doctor before becoming bp. of Maypherqaṭ (Greek Martyropolis, modern Silvan). His medical skill won him the favour of Yazdgard I (399–420), and when he was sent by the Roman emperor as a legate to Persia in 410, he and <ref type="cr">Isḥaq</ref>, the bp. of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, were able to get the Shah’s permission to convene a synod there, at which the Council of Nicaea was officially accepted by the Persian bishops; the part played by him at this Synod of 410 is described in the account of that Synod in the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref> (ed. 
J.-B.  Chabot [1902]). Marutha is said to have translated the Canons of Nicaea into Syriac, but as this statement is attached, not to the 20 genuine Canons (some of which also feature in the Canons of the Synod of 410), but to the 173 ‘Pseudo-Apostolic’ Canons, this remains doubtful. A number of Syriac texts concerning the Council of Nicaea are attributed to him, edited (along with other, unrelated, documents) by A. Vööbus (CSCO 439–40; 1982); his authorship of these is very uncertain. It was probably on his visit in 410, or on an earlier (399), that Marutha gained knowledge of some of the Acts of the Persian martyrs under Shapur II, a collection of whose bones he brought back as relics (hence his see gained the name Martyropolis). It is also possible that the list of names of these Persian martyrs at the end of the earliest dated Syriac ms., written in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> in November 411 (ed. F. Nau, in PO 10.1, 7–26), was provided by him on his return home; he may likewise have arranged for the collection and translation of some of these Acts into Greek (ed. H. Delehaye, in PO 2). A homily on New Sunday is thought by its editor (M. Kmosko, in <i>OC</i> 3 [1903], 384–415) to be by this Marutha. According to one calendar (PO 10.1, 63) he was commemorated on 3 Oct.</p>

<p>Metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref>. His biography was written by his successor, Denḥa (ed. with FT by F. Nau, in PO 3.1 [1905], 52–96). Born near <ref type="cr">Balad</ref>, after studying at schools in the Persian Empire, he spent ten years at the famous monastery of Mar Zakkay, near Kallinikos, in the Roman Empire. On returning to the Persian Empire he taught at the <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>, before being appointed the first metropolitan of Tagrit with the title ‘<ref type="cr">Maphrian</ref>’ (ca.  629). <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>’s Chronicle (XI.9) preserves a Letter by Marutha to the Patr. <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of the Sedre</ref>, giving a highly colored account of the persecution of the Syr. Orth. by <ref type="cr">Barṣawma</ref> <ref type="cr">of</ref> <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>. The Homily on New Sunday, allotted to Marutha of Tagrit by Barsoum (<i>Scattered pearls</i>, 323) is attributed to <ref type="cr">Marutha of Maypharqaṭ</ref> by its editor (Kmosko, in <i>OC</i> 3 [1903], 384–415); another homily, on the Blessing of the Waters at Epiphany, however, definitely belongs to the later Marutha. Marutha also wrote a commentary on the Gospels, from which only quotations survive. An Anaphora (included in the Maron. Missal of 1592) and at least one <i>Sedro</i> are transmitted under his name.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Mary 
</LemmaTitle><p>Mary, mother of Jesus, features prominently in all the Syriac liturgical and literary traditions. A special commemoration, the ‘Praises of Mary’, devoted to her immediately following the Nativity, is found in both E. and W. Syr. tradition, on the 2nd Friday after the Nativity in the former, and on 26 Dec. in the latter. Again in both E. and W. Syr. traditions, the Annunciation is primarily celebrated during the ‘Period of the Annunciation (Subbara/Suboro)’, covering the Sundays immediately before Christmas. A separate commemoration on 25 March was added in the Syr. Orth. tradition in the early Middle Ages, and in the Chald. tradition. Also distinctive to the Syriac Churches are the agricultural commemorations of Mary of the Seeds (15 Jan.) and Mary of the Blades of Wheat (<i>š</i><i>eble</i>; 15 May).</p>
<p>The Gospel genealogies concern only Joseph, but in due course a number of traditions grew up concerning her lineage (Davidic and/or Levitical), and besides Joachim and Anna as the names of her parents, a few texts provide Zadoq and Dina as alternatives. The earliest elaborations of traditions concerning her life are to be found in the 2nd-cent. (Greek) Protogospel of James, translated into Syriac. She features obliquely in the <ref type="cr">Odes of Solomon</ref> (Ode 19), and very prominently in <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>’s <i>madrāše</i> on the Nativity (some of which are written with her as the imagined speaker [e.g no. 11]). She is also the subject of a group of early <i>madrāše</i> attributed (wrongly) to Ephrem, as well as of a number of <i>memre</i> by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>. She features as the protagonist in several dialogue <i>soghy</i><i>āthā</i> (Mary and the Angel, Mary and Joseph, Mary and the Magi, Mary and the risen Jesus), and in a number of anonymous <i>memre</i> (including a narrative poem on Mary and Joseph). Some of the earliest texts concerning the death, or ‘Departure’, of Mary are preserved in early Syriac mss., and these play an important role in the study of the development of traditions concerning her Dormition/Assumption. Numerous liturgical texts commemorating her in both prose and poetry are to be found in all the Syriac liturgical traditions; in the Melk. tradition, in particular, there are many texts on Mary which are translated from Greek (including the ‘Akathistos’). In the verse texts especially, great use is made of typology, whose aim is to bring out different aspects of her miraculous birthgiving and the relationship between her and her Child; thus numerous prefigurations of her in the OT are identified, such as the ‘fleece’ of Judg. 6:36–7, ‘thirsty earth’ of Is. 53:2, or ‘door’ of Ez. 44:2. Most of these ‘types’ are also to be found in Greek and Latin liturgical poetry, and this applies to the extensive contrasted Eve/Mary typology, which gave rise to the imagery of the divine Word being sown in Mary’s ear, thus providing a specific contrast with Eve’s listening to the serpent’s false promise. Some of the ‘types’, however, are distinctive to the Syriac tradition: thus Mary as a ‘tree’ is based ultimately on Ephrem’s Commentary on Gen. 22:13, where the ram ‘held’ in the tree (bush) is seen as a type of Christ, the Lamb, held in Mary’s womb.</p>
<p>At the roots of the controversy over the use of the title ‘Bearer of God’ (<i>yāldat alāhā</i>) lie two different conceptualizations of how salvation for humanity is brought about by Christ. For the W.-Syr. tradition the Word of God descends and underpins, as it were, humanity at the incarnation, so that the title ‘Bearer of God’ simply expresses Mary’s role in salvation history. For the Ch. of E., however, salvation is conceived as being effected for humanity through the raising of Christ’s body, representing our humanity, at the Ascension; accordingly, it is essential to distinguish mentally between Christ’s divinity and the humanity which he has assumed at his birth from Mary, otherwise salvation would not be ensured.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Masius, Andreas</head><ab type="infobox"/>(1514–1573)
<p>Humanist, early scholar of Syriac. Born in the village of Lennik, near Brussels, Masius studied Hebrew, Greek, and Latin in Louvain. Throughout his life he combined his intellectual curiosity with his diplomatic skills, traveling through Europe, often in the service of ecclesiastical or political authorities. After having studied some Arabic with Guillaume Postel in Rome, he made the acquaintance of <ref type="cr">Mushe of Mardin</ref>, who taught him Syriac in Rome in 1553. In the same year he also met <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref>, for whom Masius did some translation work from Syriac into Latin. Both men, Mushe and Sullaqa, are quoted as authorities in Masius’s later Syriac publications. With Mushe, Masius corresponded in Syriac: ten letters are preserved dated between 1553 and 1555 (Wesselius). Preceded only by <ref type="cr">Teseo Ambrogio</ref>, Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter, and Guillaume Postel, Masius belonged to the first generation of European scholars who had an academic interest in the Syriac language.</p>
<p>While Masius was involved in the Antwerp Polyglot Bible (Biblia Regia) printed by Christophe Plantin (Christoffel Plantijn) between 1569 and 1572, he did not prepare the Syriac NT text that is included in it (this was done by the young French scholar Guy Lefèvre de la Boderie). Masius contributed, however, two major tools that were included in vol. 6 of the Polyglot (1571): a Syriac grammar and a Syriac glossary (<i>Syrorum Peculium</i> ‘Private property of the Syrians’). These two works may be seen as ‘the first European grammar and dictionary of Syriac’, while his grammar served as a model for several subsequent grammars (Contini). Prior to his work for the Polyglot, Masius published a Latin translation of <ref type="cr">Mushe bar Kipho</ref>’s Commentary on Paradise (1569). This was the first Syriac literary work to be brought to the attention of European intellectuals (it was reprinted in Migne’s PG 11, 481–608, but the Syriac text remains unpublished). For this translation, Masius relied on a Syriac ms. that he had bought from Mushe of Mardin (it is now lost). Another important ms. in Masius’s possession contained part of the Pentateuch and the Historical Books of the OT in the version of the <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref>. Masius never published this text, but quoted from it in his <i>Peculium</i> as well as in a study on the OT Book of Joshua (1574). This ms. too was subsequently lost. It is generally assumed that it was somehow related to ms. Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, C 313 inf., which was published by A. M. Ceriani and which contains the Wisdom Books and the Prophetical Books of the OT. Masius’s ms. and the Milan ms., when complete, together must have contained the entire OT in the version of the Syro-Hexapla (Baars).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Masora
</LemmaTitle><p>Name given by modern scholars to an 8th/9th-cent. compilation in W.-Syr. as well as in E.-Syr. tradition, containing various philological and grammatical materials to serve as a tool for the standardization of orthography and pronunciation of the Syriac language. The major part consists of sample texts drawn from the OT, the NT, and patristic texts in order to illustrate the correct use of the language in writing and reading.</p>
<label type="subsection">1. Name</label>
<p>The term ‘Masora’ (‘tradition’) was adopted from the well-known Hebrew Masora, which fixed the orthography and pronunciation of the Hebrew Bible (‘Masoretic text’). However, in contrast to the Hebrew Masora, the character of the Syr. ‘masoretic’ compilations is not normative but regulative: Based on sample texts they standardize the orthographic representation of the pronunciation; they are not fixing the text itself by introducing an exclusive orthography. In the Syriac mss., the title of the compilation (at least of its first and largest part) is: ‘Booklet of (vocalized) words and readings of the OT and the NT according to the tradition of Qarqaphto’ (<i>Kurroso da-šmohe w-da-qroyotho d-ʿattiqto w-da-ḥdatto</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>a(y)k mašlmonutho qarqphoyto</i>, ms. Vat. Syr. 152), or shorter: ‘Booklet of (vocalized) words of the Holy Scriptures’ (<i>Kurroso da-šmohe da-ktobhe qaddiš</i><i>e,</i>ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,178). According to the longer title the compilation originated from the <ref type="cr">Qarqaphto</ref> <ref type="cr">Monastery</ref> near <ref type="cr">Reshʿayna</ref>, and <i>Mašlmonutho Qarqphoyto</i> would, therefore, be the appropriate Syriac title. This Syriac title, however, did not succeed in replacing the convenient modern term ‘Masora’ and its derivation ‘Masoretic’, both of which should be used with quotation marks.</p>
<label type="subsection">2. Historical Background</label>
<p>The historical background of the ‘Masora’ is the fading away of Syriac as the colloquial language of Syr. Christians after the rise of Islam. This situation stimulated grammar and lexicography among the Syrians to consolidate the native language and cultural heritage in order to preserve the Syr. Christian identity. Some of the materials compiled in the ‘Masora’ can be traced back to the 7th cent. and derive from <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (ca. 633–708), who introduced the systematic study of grammar and orthography among the W. Syrians. He might be the initiator or instigator of the ‘Masora’, which started to flourish immediately after his death.</p>
<label type="subsection">3. Manuscript Witnesses</label>
<p>There are 15 mss. of the ‘Syriac Masora’ in W.-Syr. tradition: Brit. Libr. Add. 12,178 (9th/10th cent., from the ‘Nitrian collection’ of the British Library); Brit. Libr. Add. 14,667, ff. 1–12 (10th, OT only); Brit. Libr. Add. 17,162, ff. 1–14 + Dayr al-Suryān Syr. 14 (10th/11th, OT only); Brit. Libr. Add. 14,482 (11th/12th, OT only); Brit. Libr. Add. 14,684 (12th/13th, OT, NT, and Greek Fathers); Vat. Syr. 152 (979/80); Barberini orient. 118 (ca. 1000); Syr. Orth. Patr. Dam. 7/16 (Aug. 1004), and 12/22 (colophon lost; the date 666 AD given in <i>ParOr</i> 19 [1994], 606, is not the date of the ms.); Borg. 117 (1868, a copy of Dam. 7/16); Harvard 176 (according to M. H.  Goshen-Gottstein 1303 Sel. = 991/92 AD; Gospel of John); Brit. Libr. Add. 7183 (ca. 1031–1034); Lund 58 (1204/05); Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 64 (1134/35); Jerusalem, St. Mark 1* (Baumstark)/42 (Dolabani; 16th/17th). The single ms. of the ‘Masora’ in E.-Syr. tradition is Brit. Libr. Add. 12,138 (April 899). One ms. formerly in Chicago was a xerox-copy of Syr. Orth. Patr. Dam. 7/16.</p>
<label type="subsection">4. W.-Syr. ‘Masora’</label>
<p>In mss. of the W.-Syr. tradition, the compilation is divided into four distinctive sections. Within these sections, however, the arrangement and size of the materials may differ.</p>
<p>a. The first and largest section (for title, see above) consists of extracts taken from all books of the OT and NT <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>, and of the <ref type="cr">Ḥarqlean</ref> version of the NT. The extracts, which are usually confined to half-verses or even to single words, are fully vocalized and furnished with <i>quššoyo</i> and <i>rukkokho</i> (for ms. Vat. Syr. 152, see Hatch, <i>Album</i>, plate LXXV). Marginal readings drawn from various biblical mss. (e.g. from the Philoxenian version) or from patristic authorities refer to different modes of spelling, reading, and punctuation. In some mss., to this first section are appended ‘(vocalized) nouns and readings from the books of the holy teachers’ (<i>šmohe wa-qroyotho da-ktobhe d-mallphone qaddiše</i>), drawn from the writings of various patristic authors that were held in high esteem in the Syr. Orth. tradition (see under 5).</p>
<p>b. The second section of the compilation is devoted to writings of Yaʿqub of Edessa (even though there are appended materials not deriving from Yaʿqub). It contains: 1. Yaʿqub’s letter ‘On Syriac Orthography’ (<i>meṭṭul serṭo suryoyo</i>) addressed to Giwargi, bp. of Serugh, ‘and through him to all the scribes who will encounter this book’ (ed. by P. Martin [1869] and G. Phillips [1869]). 2. Yaʿqub’s tract ‘On persons and tenses’ (<i>meṭṭul parṣupe w-zabhne</i>), in most of the mss. entitled ‘On Points’ (<i>meṭṭul nuqze</i>), as it deals with diacritical points to distinguish persons and tenses and with metrical points or accents (ed. by G. Phillips [1869]). 3. Only in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,178 an anonymous tract on metrical points is appended; and 4. (in most of the mss.) a tract on the ‘Signs of punctuation’ (<i>š</i><i>mohe d-nuqze</i>) by ‘Thomas the deacon’ (identified by some scholars with <ref type="cr">Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref>).</p>
<p>c) The main source of the third section are the writings of <ref type="cr">Epiphanius of Salamis</ref> (d. 403), well-known for his anti-heretical writings. Its title is ‘Signs of punctuation of Epiphanius’ (<i>šmohe d-nuqze d-Epiphaniyus</i>). The materials it contains are of lexicographical (‘on Greek accents and conjunctions’, ‘on weights’, ‘on measures’, ‘on variation of the person by points’), biographical (‘on prophecy’, ‘on the death of the prophets’, ‘on the Apostles’) and stichometric (OT and NT) character.</p>
<p>d) The fourth section consists of heterogeneous materials and starts with an explanation (<i>puššoqo</i>) of words from Hebrew and from other languages drawn from the Septuagint (<i>Mašlmonutho d-šabʿin</i>) and the ‘correction’ (<i>Turroṣo</i>) of Yaʿqub of Edessa. This is followed (in ms. Vat. Syr. 152) by a tract of a ‘Philosopher on the seven climates’ (probably by <ref type="cr">Dawid bar Pawlos</ref> d-Beth Rabban). A text attributed to <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> ‘on the composition of man’ and a tract ‘on the unity of Christ’s body’ by ‘some stranger’ (<cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>noš</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>akhsnoyo</i>) conclude the whole compilation.</p>
<p>The differences of the sections in arrangement and size (and the total absence of several items from some mss.) suggest a textual development and history of the compilation. The original Western ‛Masora’ may be dated to the 7th cent. (<i>terminus post quem</i> is the Ḥarqlean version of 615/16) and was probably devoted to the biblical materials only. Yaʿqub’s death 708 offers the early 8th cent. as <i>terminus a quo</i> for the first development (the second section). The fully developed compilation may be dated to the 8th or 9th cent. Whether the development derives from the Qarqphoye monks is not clear. However, the materials compiled in the ‘Masora’ are of homogeneous character in that they reflect the main authorities of Miaphysite theology and philology (biblical and patristic texts, Yaʿqub of Edessa) and deal with orthography and pronunciation of Syriac.</p>
<label type="subsection">5. The Patristic Selections in the W.-Syr. Manuscripts</label>
<p>While Masoretic mss. so far have received attention mainly from biblical scholars, the patristic selections, which in most W.-Syr. mss. are an integral part of the collections, have recently been studied in great detail by J. Loopstra (2009). At least eleven mss. are known to contain patristic selections. They include the following texts: 1. the ‘Cathedral Homilies’ of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> (in the translation of Yaʿqub of Edessa), preceded by four letters exchanged between Severus, John of Alexandria, and the Synod of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>; 2. the Homilies of <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, followed by the Pseudo-Nonnus mythological scholia, both in the revised translation of <ref type="cr">Pawla of Edessa</ref>; 3. Epistles <ref type="cr">of Basil of Caesarea</ref> and Gregory of Nazianzus; 4. the Homilies of Basil; 5. the <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Dionysian</ref> corpus (in the translation by Phocas of Edessa); 6. the Life of Severus of Antioch by <ref type="cr">John bar Aphtonia</ref> (found in one ms. only: Brit. Libr. Add. 7,183); 7. and the <i>Arbiter</i> of <ref type="cr">John Philoponos</ref> (found in one ms. only: Brit. Libr. Add. 14,684). The patristic sections of the ‘Masoretic’ mss. clearly demonstrate the non-normative (but regulative) character of the ‘Masoretic’ standardisation (although patristic writings are scarcely attested in post-‘Masoretic’ mss.). It is quite obvious that the standard does not refer to the spelling of Greek proper nouns and theological terms (which is not uniform in the ‘Masoretic’ mss. themselves) but to their proper phonetical representation (which may vary within the standard of grecization). In addition to that, the patristic sections of the ‘Masora’ provide unique insights into linguistic and lexical studies by Syrian scholars and scribes, as well as into an important branch of the educational system of the Syr. Orth. tradition.</p>
<label type="subsection">6. E.-Syr. ‘Masora’</label>
<p>The E.-Syr. ‘Masora’ (Wright, <i>Catalogue … British Museum</i>, vol. 1, 101–08; studied by Th. Weiss, 1933) is more extensive than its W.-Syr. counterpart as it is of almost exclusive biblical character (OT and NT, Peshitta only). The biblical samples are extensively annotated in the margins. There are five sections: the first deals with the pronunciation (phonetic); the second with the use of the accents; the third is devoted to various letters of the alphabet and their specific combinations (the letters <i>b-d-w-l</i>; the letters <i>b-g-d-k-p-t</i>; <cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>-m-n-t</i> as marking tenses and persons; <cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>-h-w-y-k-n-t</i> when suffixed). The fourth section gives an explanation of certain critical marks attached to words in the biblical part of the ms. The fifth section (last page) gives ‘traditions of the masters of the schools.’</p>
<label type="subsection">7. Bar ʿEbroyo’s Testimony</label>
<p>According to <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, ‘Book of Splendors’ (ed. and transl. by A. Moberg 1922/1907), §3 of the introduction, the <i>Qarqphoye</i>monks introduced the five ‘Greek’ vowel signs to Syriac. This innovative ‘Masoretic’ feature follows (but simplifies) the model of Yaʿqub of Edessa, who invented seven vowel <i>letters</i> for grammatical demonstration (see Segal, <i>Diacritical point</i>, 40–7). The five ‘Greek’ vowel signs were not intended to be fully applied to Syriac texts but restricted to ‘grammatical’ specification of difficult or ambiguous words. Fully vocalized mss. do not antedate the 16th cent. and take into consideration the reader’s ignorance of the traditional pronunciation. The witnesses of the ‘Syriac Masora’ are the earliest mss. with vowel signs attached to the text by the original scribe.</p>
<label type="subsection">8. ‘Pre-Masoretic’ and ‘Masoretic’</label>
<p>Although the ‘Masoretic’ system of vocalisation was not designed to replace the use of the ‘pre-Masoretic’ diacritical point, which served to distinguish grammatical persons and tenses, the imperfection of the traditional system called for further specification. The ‘Masoretic’ innovation was the adoption of the diacritical point and its explicit redefinition by vowel signs and <i>qušš</i><i>oyo/rukkokho</i>. The coexistence of the old and new system of grammatical distinction is evidenced in the ‘Masoretic’ mss. themselves (esp. in ms. Vat. Syr. 152 and ms. Barberini orient. 118): <i>quššoyo</i> and <i>rukkokho</i> are marked with large red dots to distinguish them from the smaller black diacritical point. This explicit redefinition allowed the traditional diacritical point to maintain its position in the Syriac literature; by its redefinition the diacritical point introduced the new ‘Masoretic’ standard to the ‘pre-Masoretic’ Syriac literature.</p>
<label type="subsection">9. The <i>Qarqphoyē</i> Monks Ṭubhono and Sobho</label>
<p>Two of the <i>Qarqphoye</i>monks are known by name: Ṭubhono and Sobho, both of Reshʿayna, who are mentioned in the margins of the ‘Masoretic’ mss. and in an entry of <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>’s Lexicon (ed. R. Duval, col. 1363–1364). Sobho is probably the scribe of mss. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,428 (undated; Wright, <i>Catalogue … British Museum</i>, vol.  1, 9–10), Add. 14,430 (724 AD; Wright, ibid., 15–6), and Add 12,135 (726 AD; Wright, ibid., 24–6). In his OT commentary (‘Storehouse of Secrets’ ) and once in his ‘Book of Splendors’ (I.5, §4) Bar ʿEbroyo refers (occasionally with some distance) to the reading of the <i>Qarqphoye</i>monks (in Psalms and Jeremiah; the texts are in P. Martin, ‘Tradition karkaphienne’, 261–8).</p>
<label type="subsection">10. The ‘Masora’ in Recent Scholarship</label>
<p>It was P. Martin who in his ‘Tradition karkaphienne’ (1869) identified the ‘Masoretic’ character of the compilation. Parts of the E.-Syr. ‘Masora’ were published in 1933 by Th. Weiss. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the W.-Syr. ‘Masora’ no (critical) edition has been undertaken so far. For editors of the Syriac OT and NT, the ‘Masoretic’ mss. seem to be of no great critical value on account of their abridged and selective way of quotation. Nevertheless, ‘Masoretic’ mss. have been extensively used in research on the OT Peshitta. Although excluded from the ‘Leiden Edition’ of the OT, the ‘Masora’ contributed to the research on the ms. tradition of single OT books (P. B. Dirksen, on Judges [1972]; M. Koster, on Exodus [1977]; and A. Gelston, on Twelve Prophets [1987]). The Peshitta Gospel edition prepared by Ph. E. Pusey and G. H. Gwilliam (1901) includes the E.-Syr. ‘Masora’ as well as three mss. of the W.-Syr. ‘Masora’ (mss. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,178; Add. 7183; and Add. 14,648). This Gospel edition turns the ‘Masoretic’ sample texts into a complete edition by its systematic adoption of the Western pronunciation. It is fully vocalized with the five ‘Greek’ vowels and furnished with <i>quššoyo</i> and <i>rukkokho</i>. However, it does not give the ‘Masoretic’ orthography of the proper nouns and Greek (loan) words, but rather follows the orthography of the ‘pre-Masoretic’ mss. A ‘Masoretic’ edition of the Peshitta Acts and Epistles was published in 1920 by G. H. Gwilliam and J. Pinkerton (British and Foreign Bible Society).</p>
<label type="subsection">Conclusion</label>
<p>Bringing together the fields of grammar and lexicography, the ‘Masora’ is of general significance for the study of Syriac language and literature; it also contributes to our understanding of the history and culture of the Syrians. The ‘Masoretic’ perspective on Syriac literature allows for the distinction of a ‘pre-Masoretic’ (5th–
7th cent.) and a ‘Masoretic’ (8th–13th cent.) period, both with their own characteristic features. The earlier period was the formative period of Syriac culture, open to Greek influence, development and inculturation into the Greek Byzantine Oikumene; it roughly coincides with the pre-Islamic history of the Syrian Churches. The later period is marked by philology, standardization, and by the formation of ‘national’ E.-Syr. and W.-Syr. traditions. This conservative attitude towards their own heritage roughly coincides with the history of the Syriac Churches under Islam. Still today reading and writing of Syriac texts is directed by the ‘Syriac Masora’.</p>

[ Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Author, monk, and solitary, abbot of the Monastery of the Cross (<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Ṣalīb</ref>) near Ḥaḥ (ca. 1462/3–1480/1), bp. for the Monastery of Mor Quryaqos in Hezza near Zargel and Ḥesno d-Kifo (1480/1) with the name Basil. Afram Barsoum identifies him with the Patr. Masʿūd of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> (d. 1509). Masʿūd was a vigorous promotor of monastic life in Ṭur ʿAbdin. He is the author of the <i>elpo ruḥonoyto</i>‘the Spiritual Boat’, a work intended to guide monks and solitaries to the ‘haven of impassibility’. Written in the dodecasyllable meter, it is essentially an ascetical and mystical treatise. It is divided into three parts, on trinity, on christology and on the divine gifts and virtues distributed by Christ to the Angels and human beings. The third part is based indirectly on the Celestial Hierarchy of <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</ref>. As a Patr. he appointed a maphr. and twelve bishops for Ṭur ʿAbdin, which caused much confusion. According to Barsoum, some senior bishops denounced him to the Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. Masʿūd had to step back for some time, but was again in function by the end of his life. According to the continuator of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History, these senior bishops denounced him however to the Emir of Ḥesno d-Kifo, who confined him to a monastery. As a result he abdicated and ordered his followers not to appoint a new Patr. of Ṭur ʿAbdin.</p>
<p>The main source of Masʿūd’s life till his episcopal ordination is a short note written by his disciple ʿAziz which is preserved in the oldest ms. of the Spiritual Boat, now kept in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>. According to this note Masʿūd composed some other writings, which do not seem to have been preserved.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Located on the Alfof Mountain, known in Arabic as Jabal Maqlūb, 35 km. northeast of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, the monastery is mostly known by its Arabic name Dayr Mār Mattā. It is named after a monk named Matay who came from the region of <ref type="cr">Amid</ref> in the latter part of the 4th cent. It is known from historical documents as early as the late 5th or early 6th cent., when it was already a center of the Syr. Orth. Church. The Chronicles of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> and <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> record that life resumed at the monastery by the end of the 5th cent. Monasticism took various forms in the monastery, including monks who were <cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>abil</i><i>e</i> ‘anchorites’, <i>ḥbiš</i><i>e</i> ‘recluses’, and <cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>iḥidoy</i><i>e</i> ‘hermits’, but others preferred communal life. The monastery appears to have had a bishopric line from its early days, whose title often included <ref type="cr">Nineveh</ref> (<ab type="infobox"/>i.e. Mosul). It was also here that a number of local Synods took place. The bishopric of this monastery was so strong that on many occasions, especially from the 7th cent. onward, the residing bp. would challenge the authority of the <ref type="cr">Maphrian</ref>, to the degree that he became a de facto co-equal to the Maphrian, each of them ruling over half of the Syr. Orth. Church in the East. In 869, Patr. Yuḥanon III held a Synod which reiterated the subordinate position of the Maphrianate of the East in relation to the Patriarchate of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. In addition, the first Canon of that Synod made it clear that the bp. of the monastery is to be subordinate to the Maphrian. Michael Rabo also reiterated this relationship in 1174. The monastery was famous for its magnificent library which is cited in the correspondence of <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> in the 8th cent., and later by <ref type="cr">Dawid bar Pawlos</ref><ab type="infobox"/>of Beth Rabban. It is also mentioned in a colophon of a Syriac ms. (Berlin, no. 327) that in 1298 the library contained all the writings of Bar ʿEbroyo. In 1171, the Kurds attacked the monastery and many of the mss. were damaged; some that survived were carried by monks to Mosul. In 1369, another Kurdish attack on the monastery damaged more mss. Today mss. from this monastery can be found in<ab type="infobox"/> the British Library, Cambridge University Library, Staatsbibliothek, Berlin, and the Vatican Library. The monastery served as the seat for the Maphrian on many occasions. Bar ʿEbroyo spent the first seven years of his Maphrianate here. During the early 19th cent., the Kurds raided the monastery many times, and as a result it was abandoned for 12 years. Later that century, Oswald Parry, a delegate of the Archbishop of Canterbury, visited the monastery and published an account detailing life there. In modern times, the monastery was the venue of the Dayro d-Mor Matay Synod in 1930, the first and only Synod with representation of the laity. The Beth Qadishe of the monastery contains the remains of six Maphrians and many bishops including Bar ʿEbroyo and his brother. The monastery has over 50 rooms, 3 halls for gathering, and a church. To the left of the monastery is a large cave with natural mountain spring water dripping from the ceiling. Today, the monastery is the seat of its own archdiocese.</p>

<p>Notable Greek theologian and author. He was an intrepid defender of the dyothelete position (‘two wills’ in the incarnate Christ), in defiance of Heraclius and his successors who upheld a monothelete christology; he was finally condemned to mutilation and exile under Constans II, but was posthumously rehabilated at the Council of Constantinople in 680–1. Monotheletes were evidently strong in Syria and Palestine, where literature against the dyotheletes (‘the heresy of Maximus’) was produced; relics of this survive in Syriac, notably a short work by Shem<cTypeface:Italic>ʿun of Qenneshre, preserved in two Chronicles (<ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, XI.9, and the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of 1234</ref>; parallel FT in Guillaumont); this claims to be based on ‘books of the Maronites’, one of which is an early (hostile) biography, which remarkably states that Maximus originated from Palestine and not Constantinople (as the Greek tradition claimed; the evidence is weighed up by Boudignon).</p>

<p>Syriac Medicine comprises the efforts of the Syriac-speaking communities of the West and the East to avoid disease and cure ailments. The focus in the present article will be on Syriac medical literature of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages; at the end of the entry, the role of Syriac-speaking Christians in the development of hospitals will come under scrutiny.</p>
<p>The Syriac medical tradition, as Syriac literature in general, owes a great debt to the Greek heritage, and notably to the Galenism of Late Antique Alexandria (see Temkin). Two periods of Graeco-Syriac translation mark this transfer of knowledge. The first occurred during the early 6th, and the second during the 9th cent.. The first period is mainly associated with <ref type="cr">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref>, a W.-Syr. priest who studied medicine and philosophy in Alexandria. He translated many philosophical texts, but also the so-called Sixteen Books of <ref type="cr">Galen</ref>, a selection of works used to teach medicine in Alexandria, as well as other works by Galen; Theodoros, the bp. of Karkh Juddan (fl. ca. 525–45), commissioned a number of them. The E.-Syr. <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. ca. 873) and his school dominate the second period. It has to be emphasised that Ḥunayn’s school produced many more and often much better translations than the 6th-cent. translators (see Gutas). Despite their popularity, few of these Syriac versions survived; the Arabic versions by Ḥunayn’s school quickly eclipsed them. We are, however, able to study the Graeco-Syriac translation technique, not least since <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>’s ‘Lexicon’ incorporates the vocabulary lists used by Ḥunayn and his entourage (see Bhayro).</p>
<p>Syriac authors did not limit themselves to translating Greek sources, but also wrote many independent treatises on various aspects of medicine. But here again, most of the literature is lost today. There are, however, at least two works which ought to be mentioned here. The most substantial extant medical text in Syriac is the so-called ‘Syrian Book of Medicine’ by an unknown author and of unknown date (estimates range from the 6th to the 13th cent.). It consists of three distinct parts: Part One is mainly based on Galen’s ‘On the Affected Parts’ and ‘On the Composition of Drugs according to Places in the Body’; Part Two deals with astro-medicine, that is the impact of the stars on human health; and Part Three contains many popular and magic recipes and treatments. <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Sarapion</ref> (Ibn Sarābiyūn) compiled the second extant independent work: a medical encyclopedia (<i>kunnāš</i>) in seven books which is lost in the Syriac original, but does survive in Arabic, Latin, and Hebrew translations (Pormann). It provides an outline of Galenic medicine, the first four books dealing with diseases ‘from tip to toe’; the fifth with bites by insects and poisonous animals, skin condition, and gynaecological disorders; the sixth with fevers; and the seventh with ‘compound drugs’, i.e. it contains many thousands of recipes. Yoḥannan bar Sarapion continues the Greek encyclopaedic tradition as represented by Paul of Aegina (fl. ca. 640s), but also incorporates the pharmacopoeia of the East (notably Indian) into the system of humoral pathology inherited from the Greeks.</p>
<p>We know of many famous Syriac-speaking physicians. Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq was not only a translator, but also the personal physician of a number of caliphs. Likewise, his teacher Yūḥannā b. Māsawayh (d. 857) also excelled in the medical art. Both mostly wrote in Arabic, and acquired great fame in the area of ophthalmology. The most prominent Syriac medical family are without any doubt the Bukhtishūʿ. They hailed from the famous city of Gondeshapur (<ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>), and were in the employ of various caliphs from the 7th to the 10th cent.</p>
<p>This leads us to the final topic: hospitals set up by Syriac Christians. Some scholars have argued that by the 4th cent. sophisticated hospitals existed in the Christian world (e.g. in Cappadocia or Gondeshapur); but these claims have rightly been dismissed (see Dols; Horden). It is, however, beyond doubt that Christian charitable ideas had an impact on the development of Islamic Hospitals (Pormann). From a letter to the Ch. of E. Patr. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> (d. 823) we know that a substantial Syriac hospital was in existence by the late 8th cent.; it was called <i>xenodocheion</i> (Greek for ‘place for strangers’) and <i>bimāristān</i> (Persian for ‘place of the sick’). Moreover, a number of important Abbasid officials who set up Islamic hospitals  — such as ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā, the ‘good vizier’ (d. 946) — had Syriac family backgrounds or ties to the Syriac medical elite.</p>

<Author>P. E. Pormann</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Melitene
</LemmaTitle><p>City in eastern Anatolia, located near the right bank of the Euphrates and to the north of the main range of the Eastern Taurus. It lies in a fertile plain whose orchards are famed today for their apricots and where the ancient Persian ‘Royal Road’ intersected the north-south route along the Euphrates. Its name appears in forms such as <i>Malidiya</i> and <i>Melidi</i> in Hittite and Assyrian records from the middle of the 2nd millennium BC. Melitene became an important garrison town under Roman rule and was made a provincial capital in the 4th cent. (of ‘Armenia  II’, renamed ‘Armenia III’ in 536). The city lay in an area that often changed hands between the Byzantines and the Arabs after the rise of Islam. It was first attacked by the Turks in 1058, and, after periods of rule by the Armenian curopalate Philaretos Brachamios and the similarly Armenian, though Chalcedonian, Gabriel (Khoril) of Melitene, it passed to the Danishmendids in 1101 and then to the Rum Seljuks in the 1170’s. The Mongols first reached the neighbourhood of Melitene in 1231, and attacked the city on several occasions in 1243–44 and 1251–53. Melitene continued to be ruled by the Seljuks under Mongol suzerainty until it fell to the Mamluks in 1315. The city was taken by the Ottomans in 1516. The modern city of Malatya, to which the majority of the population migrated in the 19th cent., is situated approximately 12 km. to the south-southwest of the site of the antique and medieval city, which is known today as Old Malatya (Eski Malatya, officially Battalgazi).</p>
<p>Melitene was an important center of Christianity from early on. Meletius of Antioch (d. 381), who presided over the First Council of Constantinople, was a native of the city, while its early bishops included such figures as Otreios, present at that council of 381, Acacius 
(d. before 449), one of the fathers at Ephesus (431), Mamas (Momo), a renegade to the miaphysite cause who was restored to his see under Justin I, and Domitian 
(d. 602), a nephew of Emperor Maurice (582–602). The list of bishops for Melitene in the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael I Rabo</ref> (Chabot, <i>Chronique de Michel le Syrien</i>, vol. 3, 494) indicates that there was a long interruption after Domitian, no doubt reflecting the absence of Syr. Orth. Christians in the area. The list resumes with names of four bishops whose dates are unknown. The fifth name on that part of the list is that of bp. Daniel, ordained by <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> (Patr. 818–45). From Grigorios onwards, who was ordained by Patr. Basilios (923–35), the titulars are styled as ‘metroplitans’.</p>
<p>Melitene and the surrounding area, lying to the north of areas traditionally inhabited by Syr. Christians, saw an influx of Syr. Orth. settlers in the wake of their reconquest by the Byzantines in 934 and especially after the adoption of a policy encouraging such migration by Nicephoras II Phocas (963–69), who, being unable to entice Chalcedonians to settle in the area, invited the Syr. Orth. Patr. Yuḥanon da-Srigteh (965–86) to move with his followers to the region of ‘Melitene, Hanzīṭ, and Qlisuro’, promising them immunity from persecution (Chabot, <i>Chronique de Michel le Syrien</i>, vol. 4, 335f.). Although that promise was not kept for long, the wealth created through this resettlement became a major factor in bringing about the revival of cultural activities among Syr. Christians which has come to be termed the ‘<ref type="cr">Syriac Renaissance</ref>’. Melitene played a central role in the ecclesiastical and cultural life of the Syr. Orth. Church during the following three centuries, giving birth to the most important Syr. Orth. authors from that period, Michael I Rabo, <ref type="cr">Bar</ref> <ref type="cr">ʿEbroyo</ref>, and, probably, <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>. Of the Patriarchs from the period, Yuḥanon bar <LemmaTitle>ʿ</LemmaTitle>Abdun (1004–31), <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon X bar Shushan</ref><LemmaTitle></LemmaTitle>(1064–73), Athanasios VI bar Qeṭreh (1139–66), and <ref type="cr">Michael II the Younger</ref> (1199–1215), as well as Michael I, were natives of Melitene, while Athanasios bar Kamoro (1090–1129), though born in <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>, was raised in Melitene, and Ignatius III Dawid (maph. 1215–22, Patr. 1222–52), Dionysios VI ʿAngur (1252–61), and Philoxenos Nemrud (1283–92) were metropolitans of Melitene before their elevation to the patriarchate. A large number of other authors, such as the apostate Ignatius (Iwanis) Marqos bar Qiqi (metr. of Melitene, then maph. 991–1016), Ignatius of Melitene (d. 1104), Yuḥanon Saʿīd bar Ṣabūnī (metr. in 1105), <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Wahbun</ref> (d. 1193), Grigorios Yaʿqub (maph. 1189–1214), were also associated with the city either as its natives or its metropolitans.</p>
<p>In the first half of the 11th cent., the Coptic bp. Michael of Tinnīs, reporting on his visit to the region, spoke of Melitene as the large city under the jurisdiction of Patr. Yuḥanon bar ʿAbdun, with 56 churches and 60,000 arms-bearing Christians in the city and its surroundings (A. S. Atiya et al., <i>History of the Patriarchs of the Egyptian Church</i>, vol. 2, pt. 2 [Cairo, 1948], 141f.). The Christians of the city included Melkites, as well as Armenians, and it may have been through contacts with Melkites there that the redaction of the <i>Qonune yawnoye</i> designated as Melitenian was adopted by the Syr. Christians. The leading role Metr. Dionysios ʿAngur is reported to have played in the defence of the city in 1243 suggests that the Syr. Christians then constituted the majority of the Christians and possibly also of the overall population. One peculiarity of the local dialect of Aramaic, the pronunciation of <i>qoph</i> as <i>gomal</i>, is mentioned by Bar ʿEbroyo in his treatise ‘On equilitteral words’ (Martin, <i>Œuvres grammaticales d’Abou’lfaradj dit Bar Hebreus</i>, vol. 2, 82; cf. Duval, <i>Traité de grammaire syriaque</i>, xi).</p>
<p>The political disturbances in the latter half of the 13th cent. evidently had a devastating effect on the Syr. Orth. communities in Melitene and its surroundings; Bar ʿEbroyo, writing in 1283, says that there was ‘not one house remaining’ in the seven dioceses in the neighbourhood of Melitene, namely Laqabin, ʿArqo, Qlisuro, Gubos, Ṣemḥo, Qlawdiya, and Gargar (Abbeloos and Lamy, <i>Gregorii Barhebraei chronicon ecclesiasticum</i>, vol. 3, 459). One of the three claimants to the patriarchate in the schism following the death of Philoxenos Nemrud was Constantine of Melitene, who was murdered by the Kurds within a year of his ordination in 1293. The third in the Cilician line of patriarchs was Basilios Gabriel of Melitene (1349–87), while Ignatius Shihāb (1366–81), the third in the Mardin line, is also said to have been metropolitan of Melitene (A. Barsoum, <i>History of the Za’faraan Monastery</i> [2008], 49; F. Y. Dolabani, <i>Maktbonuto d-faṭriyarke d-Anṭiyokiy</i>a [1990], 186). In two lists drawn up in 1579/80–81 the title of the bp. of Melitene is found attached to that of Gargar and <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. By the end of the 19th cent., the Christian population of the city consisted almost entirely of Armenians, who made up about one tenth of the total population of 30,000 (V.  Cuinet, <i>La Turquie d’Asie</i>, vol. 2 [1892], 372).</p>
<p>Although there was never any significant E.-Syr. presence in the region around Melitene, ‘bishop of Tarsus and Malatya’ is mentioned as a suffragan of <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref> in a list of Ch. of E. bishoprics found appended in an early 13th-cent. ms. (Vat. Arab. 157) to the canonical work of Elias of Damascus (ca. 900) (Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 2, 458f.; cf. Graf, <i>GCAL</i>, vol. 2, 134).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Meliton the Philosopher</head><ab type="infobox"/>(2nd or 3rd cent.) 
<p>Meliton is the presumed author of a short ‘Oration (<i>memr</i><i>ā</i>) before Antoninus Caesar’, preserved in ms. Brit. Libr. Add 14,658, the same ms. which also is our sole witness for the ‘Book of the laws of the countries’ associated with <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref> and for the ‘Letter of <ref type="cr">Mara bar Serapion</ref>’. Whether this Meliton is the 2nd-cent. bp. Meliton of Sardis (Asia Minor), to whom <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref> (Ecclesiastical History, IV, 26, 3 and 5–11) attributes, among other works, an apology addressed to the emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–80) remains uncertain. Eusebius’s quotations from the apology do not match the Syriac work. We may, therefore, be dealing with a different work by the same author, or with a different Meliton, or the author may have used a pseudonym.</p>
<p>The author strongly argues in favor of monotheism and rejects polytheism, which he sees as an outgrowth of the veneration of heroic men. Freewill enables man to discover the truth of the one God and to acquire eternal life. Once enlightened himself, the emperor is expected to lead his people out of error. At the end of time there will be a ‘flood of fire’ (<i>māmolā d-nurā</i>) from which, just as from the earlier ‘flood of water’, only the righteous will be saved. In spite of a few biblical references, the religious message is that of monotheism, without any mention being made of Christianity or Judaism.</p>
<p>If the work indeed was an oration, the addressee may have been either Marcus Aurelius or Caracalla (r.  198–217), both named ‘Antoninus’, and the existence of a Greek original must then be assumed. However, the author may have adopted the genre of the apologetic oration. The work may then belong to a slightly later period and possibly have been written in Syriac, originating from Syria or Mesopotamia, perhaps from the city of Mabbug, about whose early pagan cults the author seems to have been well informed.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Melkite
</LemmaTitle><p>Derived from Syriac <i>malkā,</i>‘king, emperor’, the term Melkite can have two different senses, referring to: 1. adherents of the imperial religious policy which, from the time of Justin and Justinian, enforced acceptance of the Council of Chalcedon. With the resulting development in the 6th cent. of two patriarchal lines in the Patriarchate of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, one Chalcedonian, the other Syr. Orth., the former came to be designated as ‘Melkite’ (and later also as ‘Rum Orthodox’, from <i>Romaios</i> in the sense of ‘Byzantine’). By extension the term Melkite is sometimes also used in connection with the Chalcedonian Patriarchates of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> and Alexandria. 2. adherents of the Catholic patriarchal line (since 1724) of the Chalcedonian Patriarchate of Antioch. Thus in a modern ecclesiastical context the term ‘Melkite’ is retained solely with reference to the Catholic line (sometimes alongside ‘Greek/Byzantine Catholic’) whereas ‘Rum/Byzantine Orthodox’ is used with reference to the Byzantine Orthodox patriarchal line.</p>
<Author>S. P. Brock<LemmaTitle></Author>
</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Melkite literature in Syriac
</LemmaTitle><p>Melkites ceased writing in <ref type="cr">Syriac</ref> around the 9th cent., turning to Arabic instead, though translations into Syriac of Greek monastic literature, and especially of liturgical texts continued to be made for rather longer, and Syriac remained a liturgical language in certain areas of Syria until the 17th cent. when there was a sharp decline in its use, though in a few places it continued into the early 18th cent. Thus only a small amount of Melkite writing in Syriac survives, and most of this has been preserved in mss. of the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref>, Sinai. The contents fall into several different categories:</p>
<p>1. Theological and polemical literature from the 7th cent., both dyothelete (ed. P. Bettiolo, CSCO 403–4, 1979) and monothelete (such as the Life of <ref type="cr">Maximus</ref>). What survives is probably only a very small proportion of what once existed. Three 7th-/8th-cent. authors, George of Martyropolis, Constantine, and <ref type="cr">Leon of Ḥarran</ref>, are known from the Letter of <ref type="cr">Eliya</ref>, addressed to Leon; Constantine was also a translator and copyist (ms. Brit. Libr. Or. 8606, of 723). <ref type="cr">Theodoros Abū Qurra</ref> (early 9th cent.), who normally wrote in Arabic, states that he also composed a work in Syriac (J. C. Lamoreaux, <i>Theodore Abu Qurrah</i> [2005], 119).</p>
<p>2. Translations of theological literature, including a letter of <ref type="cr">Sophronius</ref> (translated by Constantine in 721; ed. M. Albert, PO 39.2, 1978), and several homilies by Pantoleon, Anastasius, and others; a few of these were subsequently taken over into Syr. Orth. homiliaries.</p>
<p>3. Translations of Chalcedonian hagiography and monastic literature, notably <ref type="cr">John Climacus</ref>’s Ladder and the XL Martyrs of Sinai; the ‘New Finds’ at St. Catherine’s Monastery, Sinai, have produced evidence of Syriac translations of Cyril of Scythopolis’s Lives of Sabas and Euthymios (Sinai Syr. M11 and 13N, Fragments no. 36), and of the Life of Symeon the Younger Stylite (M15=76N); the last was translated in <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> in 827/8. Two further Lives, by Leontios of Neapolis, of Symeon the Fool and John the Almoner, transmitted in Syr. Orth. mss., must have originated in Melkite circles.</p>
<p>4. A single short 7th-cent. Melkite Chronicle survives (ed. A. de Halleux, in <i>LM</i>91 [1978], 5–44); either it or its source was used by some later Syr. Orth. chronicles.</p>
<p>5. A small number of monastic texts of Syr. Orth. or Ch. of E. provenance are transmitted in Melkite mss.; the unique ms. of <ref type="cr">Sahdona</ref>’s ‘Book of Perfection’ was copied in 837 specifically for St. Catherine’s Monastery. The monastic anthology in Sinai Syr. 14 (10th cent.) includes excerpts from a number of different E.-Syr. 
authors, in particular <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>and <ref type="cr">Shemʿon d-Ṭaybutheh</ref>. A Syriac ms. of the ‘First Part’ of Isḥaq’s writings survives, copied in the very Monastery of St. Sabas where it was subsequently translated into Greek (Sinai Syr. 24, with parts in Milan and Paris).</p>
<p>6. Liturgical texts; this constitutes by far the largest category. The oldest mss. sometimes still retain the original Antiochene rite, before it was altered to that of Constantinople, a process which probably took place over the 10th–11th cent. and during the period of the Byzantine reconquest of northwest Syria (968–1089). This change of rite involved the major undertaking of translating into Syriac (and Arabic) all the various Greek liturgical books that had developed by the end of the first millennium; the course of this massive enterprise still remains to be properly charted. Earlier, and perhaps already in the 8th cent. a considerable amount of Pales­tinian hymnography was translated, including canons by <ref type="cr">John of Damascus</ref>, Cosmas of Jerusalem, and others. From about the 13th cent. onwards many of the Syriac liturgical mss. also contain a good deal of Arabic as well.</p>
<p>7. For the small amount that survives of <ref type="cr">Christian Palestinian Aramaic</ref> literature, all Melkite, see that entry.</p>
<p>Almost all Melkite literature in Syriac was produced in western Syria, and important centers for its transmission were monasteries on the Black Mountain, northwest of Antioch, the region of the Kalamun, in particular <ref type="cr">Qara</ref>, and Ṣaydnāyā. Melkite copyists at St. Catherine’s Monastery (particularly active in the 
13th cent.) were mostly from these locations. By the 13th cent. a distinctive Melkite form of Syriac script had developed.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Menander, Syriac sentences of
</LemmaTitle><p>A collection of Syriac sentences attributed to ‘Menander the Wise’, probably the Greek comedian (d. 292/1 BC) under whose name circulated Greek monostichs (ed. Jaekel), many of which were not original to Menander. The Syriac sentences are preserved in the 7th-cent. ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,658 (ed. Land; corrections by Wright) which contains also various philosophical treatises and gnomologia (cf. Wright, <i>Catalogue … British Museum</i>, vol. 3, 1154–60). An epitome of the collection exists in London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,614 (ed. Sachau).</p>
<p> Scholars have differently divided the collection into individual sayings, ranging in number from 96 (Audet) to 153 (Baumstark; Schulthess has 101, Riessler 103). More recently, the sayings have been cited according to line number (Baarda counts 474 lines). The literary form of the sentences varies: there are indicative and imperative maxims as well as longer sections of moral advice. Noteworthy is the dialogue scene between Homer and his friends (ed. Land, 66.8–15; tr. Baarda, lines 78–93).</p>
<p>The Syriac sentences of Menander are addressed to a well-situated man of the upper class of society. They contain practical advice on how to live a happy, prosperous, and peaceful life, addressing themes such as the fear of God, respect for parents and elders, raising of children, choice of a wife, moderate consumption of food and drink, treatment of servants, warnings not to commit adultery, proper behavior as a guest, and friendship. The thematic structure of the Syriac Menander is loose; Kirk has argued that the collection is organized along the major stages of a life, from birth through adulthood and old age to death.</p>
<p>The Syriac text probably is a translation from the Greek (Land; Baumstark, 473f.; Schulthess, 201; Küchler, 316; Baarda, 584), the original of which is no longer extant. Frankenberg’s thesis of a Hebrew original has been widely rejected.</p>
<p>The question of the author’s cultural context is still being debated: the Syriac Menander bears resemblances both to Jewish wisdom literature (especially Proverbs, Jesus Sirach, <ref type="cr">Aḥiqar</ref>, Pseudo-Phocylides) and to Greek wisdom traditions (some Syriac sentences have a parallel in the Greek monostichs); the Syriac collection thus is part of an ‘international wisdom tradition’ (Schulthess, 201). Several earlier scholars stressed the Greek affinities (Renan, Land, Baumstark, Schulthess), whereas others argued for a Jewish authorship (Frankenberg, Riessler, Kirk). Problematic for a Jewish authorship remains a passage which warns against table fellowship with (pagan) priests (Land, 69,17–24; tr. Baarda, lines 262–77), implying a polytheistic background of the author. The text’s classification as a Jewish pseudepigraphon has been challenged (Schmid and Stählin, 623; Schürer, 693), but has recently been upheld by Baarda and Kirk. Audet argued for an Egyptian provenance; his thesis was followed by Küchler, but rejected by Baarda.</p>
<p>Concerning the date of composition, there is a consensus that the sentences date to the Roman period. An allusion to the law that a master may not kill his slave (Land, 67,21f.; tr. Baarda, line 159), first stipulated by Hadrian, suggests a date after the middle of the 1st cent. A reference to the schools of gladiators (Land, 65,13–15; tr. Baarda lines 34–33) implies as <i>terminus ante quem</i> ca. 400, since after Constantine’s legislation against gladiatorial games in 325 (Cod. Theod. 15.12.1) the schools gradually disappeared (cf. Audet, 77f.). Moreover, a reference to crucifixion as punishment for theft (Land, 70,8; tr. Baarda line 295) suggests a date before Constantine’s prohibition of this form of punishment. Hence most scholars date the collection to the 3rd cent. However, the date of the Syriac translation remains 
uncertain.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Methodius, Apocalypse of Pseudo-</LemmaTitle> 
<p>Influential Apocalyptic work of the late 7th cent. Composed in Syriac and ascribed to bp. Methodius of Olympus (martyred in 312), this apocalyptic survey of world history was clearly composed in the late 7th cent., in response to the rise of Islam. Formerly dated to earlier in the 7th cent., it is now thought to date from about 692, during the reign of ʿAbd al-Malik (685–705). The first 7 chapters cover the period up to the rebuilding of the Temple in 538 BC; beside the biblical text, these draw on traditions in the <ref type="cr">Cave of Treasures</ref>. Alexander the Great is then introduced, in connection with Gog and Magog, and he is linked by a remarkable genealogy to the royal lineage of Ethiopia, as well as to that of Rome and Byzantium; the aim of this is to explain Ps. 68:31, ‘Kush will surrender to God’, which is taken to refer to the final Byzantine emperor, who will surrender his kingdom to God after the appearance of the Son of Perdition (a motif borrowed from the <ref type="cr">Julian Romance</ref>). The Apocalypse was soon translated into Greek and then into Latin, where it proved very influential, especially in the Medieval West. The earliest forms of the Greek and Latin are re-edited by W. J.

</LemmaTitle><label type="subsection"><LemmaTitle>Michael I Rabo</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. 1199) [Syr. Orth.]</label>
<p>Patr. and historian, most notably author of a World Chronicle. Michael I Rabo (1126–99) was a distinguished Patr. and a dominant figure in the intellectual history of the Syr. Orth. Church during the 12th cent. He was renowned for his intrepid diplomacy, his rigorous legislation, and sanctions in order to reform the Syr. Orth. ecclesiastical administration as a means to enhance Christian autonomy. Michael was born in 1126 in a still largely Christian <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>, where Greeks as well as Syr. Orth. and Armenians lived side by side with Muslims. Being a member of a clerical family, Michael was sent to the nearby <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref> for education. He stayed on as a monk and prior. In the year 1166 Michael was elected patr. of the Syr. Orth. Church under the pressure of a reform party among the bishops. In order to ensure his and his flock’s interests and freedom of action Michael balanced out his relations with the warring parties in the area of his jurisdiction. Especially in the first half of his patriarchate his authority was felt and sought within the entire group of non-Chalcedonian churches, Copts and Armenians included. Michael was accepted as a frequent visitor in Latin <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> with the consent of the Byzantine emperor Manuel Komnenos (1143–80) in spite of the opposition of the Greek-orthodox community. In Antioch he was the first Syr. Orth. Patr. after the expulsion of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> (in 518) to act as patr. there and to consecrate a number of bishops. He also visited <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> several times. Michael was invited to take part in the third Lateran Council in 1179, but declined.</p>
<p>The second half of his patriarchate was overshadowed by the election of an anti-patriarch, named <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Wahbun</ref>(d. 1193) in 1180, who was supported by the Latins in the Crusader States as well as by the Armenian Cath. Gregory IV (1173–93). Apart from a rapprochement between Michael and the Seljuk Sultan Qilij Arslan II (1155–92), this led to some temporary diplomatic isolation until 1193, when Michael was fully recognized again by his church as well as by his Christian neighbors. Michael was buried in his newly-built church in Mor Barṣawmo.</p>
<p>Michael’s writing was largely concentrated on the reform project. Parallel to his numerous obligations as a patr., he collected mss. of theological and historical content and restored and compiled hagiographical and liturgical works. His canonistic work is partly conserved in later collections, but the greater part is lost, as is his treatise on dualist heresies composed for the Lateran Council. He also composed some liturgical and hagiographical works and collected ancient theological and historical sources.</p>
<p>These he used for his monumental world chronicle from the origin of the world to 1195. Michael’s chronicle has been studied intensively since its edition and translation by J.-B Chabot. Inspired by the works of bp. <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (d. 708) and Patr. <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> (d. 845), Michael’s chronicle blended both Eusebian genres, the chronological tables and the narrative ecclesiastical history. Michael used chronographies and ecclesiastical histories as sources and added further material. Only part of these he had directly before his eyes; others he used through intermediaries, as he reveals himself. Michael related his own time from a well informed and independent point of view. In view of source-critical methods and the universality of the chronological scope the highest standard in Syr. Orth. chronography was reached with this chronicle. Michael intended his work for learned clerical readers with access to a well-stocked library.</p>
<p>The text is not preserved in its entirety, and the layout of Michael’s chronicle was distorted through the process of copying. Chabot’s edition is a facsimile of a documentary copy written for him in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (Urfa) from 1897 to 1899. While the scribes tried to imitate the layout, a number of mistakes were introduced. Its <i>Vorlage</i>, the only extant ms., was written in 1598 by a very competent scribe. It is kept by the community of the Edessenians in <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>. In view of the loss of the original, this beautiful manuscript is the best witness for the layout of the chronicle. Fortunately it will soon be made available in print. This ms. was probably the <i>Vorlage</i> for an Arabic translation, which also sought to preserve some of the visual features, while changing others. The Arabic translation has much the same lacunae as the Syriac text. By comparing his version with the Arabic translation preserved in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Or. 4402 (which is one of several Arabic copies), Chabot detected some details lost in the Syriac text. No further research has been done so far on this problem.</p>
<p>The historical material was originally organized in four columns, the first being designated as the ‘succession of the patriarchs’, the second as ‘succession of the kings’, the chronological canon as ‘computation of the years’. No title of the additional column, which contains mixed material, is now known. Chapters with excursus were inserted, which interrupted the system of columns. After an open and abrupt end, six appendices follow. The first appendix is a monumental synopsis of all the kings and patriarchs mentioned. It was supposed to function as a directory. The second appendix is a treatise on the historical identity of the Syrians, who are connected to the Ancient Oriental Empires, the Assyrians, the Babylonians, and the <ref type="cr">Arameans</ref>. When the chronicle was translated into Armenian, in two different translations, in 1246 and 1247, it was transformed according to Armenian interests.</p>
<p>Michael’s chronicle was motivated by a strong cognitive interest in historical and chronological knowledge. It also examines the historical role of the Syr. Orth. as a cultural-ethnic group as well as a church on the one hand with respect to God’s plan of salvation and on the other the universal reality of historical change and contingency.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Michael II the Younger</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. 1215) [Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Patr. of the Syr. Orth. Church (1199–1215). Michael was called Younger (<i>Zʿuro</i>) by <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> in the latter’s Ecclesiastical History, in order to differentiate him from his namesake and uncle <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> (i.e. the Elder), Patr. 1166–1199. Michael’s name before the accession was Yeshuʿ Sephtono.</p>
<p>Michael came from a family of <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref> which was very influential in ecclesiastical politics. His other uncle, Ṣliba, was archbishop of <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> (1177), and later of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> (1184), ordained for both dioceses by Michael the Patr. The name of Michael’s father was Abraham (<ref type="cr">Chronicle of 1234</ref>, 339/252), whose other son, i.e. Michael’s brother Yaʿqub, was ordained, again by his uncle the patr., the <ref type="cr">maphrian</ref> 1189–1214; at the accession also he changed his name to Grigorios I.</p>
<p>Michael was a monk in <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor</ref> <ref type="cr">Barṣawmo</ref>. He wanted to become Patr. directly after his uncle’s death, and in order to play a more active role in the process of election he left his monastery, while the abbot followed him and tried to bring him back to the monastery. However due to Michael’s machinations the abbot was arrested by the governor of Gargar, and released under the condition that he would not disturb Michael any longer (Bar ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, 607).</p>
<p>Michael received his patriarchal ordination at the hand of his brother, the maphrian, in the Monastery of Mar Ḥenanya. It was on that occasion that he changed his name to ‘Michael’ so that something of his uncle’s luck would be bestowed on him (Bar ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, 611). He quickly ordained three bishops thus creating his own supporters. The inhabitants of Mardin paid a bribe to the governor of the city that he might expel him, together with his brother (Bar ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, 611). He left the city and after some attempts to find a city to exercise his authority he withdrew to his parents’ house in Melitene. For all the time of his pontificate (as an antipatriarch) Michael was in opposition to Patr. Athanasios IX (1199–1207).</p>
<p>According to the anonymous author of the ‘<ref type="cr">Chronicle of 1234</ref>’ (253, 260), who, however, regarded Athanasios as illegitimate (‘Chronicle of 1234’, 340/254), by January 1204 (‘Chronicle of 1234’, 340/253) Athanasios was recognized in Syria, the Sultanate of Rum, and <ref type="cr">Ṭur</ref> ʿ<ref type="cr">Abdin</ref>, whereas Michael was recognized in the East in the dioceses of <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref>, <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, Khabur, and Mardin. Both patriarchs used money and gifts for governors as means of promoting their cause.</p>
<p>After Athanasios’ death in 1207, the new patriarch became Yuḥanon XIV (1208–20), and Michael’s schism continued now against Yuḥanon. According to Bar ʿEbroyo Michael does not seem to have ever gained much popularity among the laity either and was criticised even by the members of his own family.</p>
<p>Michael died in 1215, 40 days after his brother, the maphrian Grigorios I, who had always supported him (Bar ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, 633).</p>

<Author>W. Witakowski</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Michael Badoqa</head><ab type="infobox"/>(6th–7th cent.)<CharStyle:Lemma info 1 Char>
<p>Syriac author and exegete; <i>bādoqā</i> (‘scholar’) and <i>mallpānā</i> (‘teacher’) at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>during <ref type="cr">Ḥenana</ref>’s tenure as its head (572–610). During the time of growing opposition to Ḥenana, Michael, along with many other scholars, left the School. Little is known about his life and his works. Among the writings attributed to him, the following are deemed authentic:</p>
<p>1. A <i>drā</i><i>šā</i> (‘dispute’) of Christological content, partly preserved, in which Michael, employing a pithy and syllogistic style, condemns the term <i>theotokos</i> and attacks Cyrillians, Severians, and Julianists (ed. Abramowski and Goodman).</p>
<p>2. A ‘Book of Questions’ (<i>Ktābā d-šu</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾʾ<i>āle</i>), of which an excerpt is preserved in <ref type="cr">Shlemon of Baṣra</ref>’s ‘Book of the Bee’. In this fragment Michael argues against the idea that the world will pass away before the resurrection of the dead. It has generally been assumed that this ‘Book of Questions’ is identical with the ‘Questions on the Text of Scripture’ in three volumes, the only work that <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>attributes to Michael. If this identification is correct, it is in all likelihood this book that was known to later exegetes, who quote a number of passages under Michael’s name (esp. the author of the Diyarbakır Commentary, <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, and the author of the <ref type="cr">Gannat Bussāme</ref>)<ref type="cr">.</ref></p>
<p>3. A different ‘Book of Questions’, from which only one question, on the theme of ‘Man as microcosm’, is still extant (unpublished; see Reinink 2007). It appears that this second ‘Book of Questions’ should not be identified with the previous one, since it specifically focuses on ‘the refutation of heresies and cults’ (Reinink 2007, 2008).</p>
<p>In addition, a ‘Book of Definitions’ (ed. Furlani) is attributed to Michael, but its spuriousness has been proven (see now Abramowski 1999). A text ‘On Dreams’, which has been transmitted as a separate work of Michael’s, turns out to be taken from this ‘Book of Definitions’, and therefore should no longer be regarded as his. Finally, an aetiological writing (<cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>elltā</i>) on the ‘Commemoration of the Blessed Lady Mary, the Bearer of Christ’ (unpublished), assigned in the mss. to ‘one of the brethren <i>badoqe</i> of the School of Nisibis’, has sometimes been considered Michael’s (already by <ref type="cr">Isḥaq Qardaḥe Shbadnaya</ref>). This attribution cannot, however, be substantiated (see Vööbus, Reinink 2008).</p>

<p>Principal town of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, situated at the geographical center of the region where the main east-west road from <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> to Gozarto (Cizre) and the north-south road from Ḥesno d-Kifo (Hasankeyf) to <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> meet. The name of the town can be traced back to that of ‘Matiāte’, which Ashurnasirpal II passed on a campaign in 879 BC. Under the Ottomans, Midyat became the administrative center of a subdistrict (<i>nahiye</i>, later <i>kaza</i>) covering the central part of Ṭur ʿAbdin and it is today the administrative center of a district (<i>ilçe</i>) within the province of Mardin. The municipality of Midyat today includes the traditionally Christian township of Midyat proper and Muslim Estel ca. 3 km. to the west.</p>
<p>An early ascetic associated with Midyat is the stylite Abel (Hobil, end of 5th cent.), who, according to the ‘Life of Samuel of Qarṭmin’, received a visit while on his pillar from young <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>. The monastery built on the site of Abel’s pillar and originally known by his name came to be better known under the name of Mor Abrohom after the relics of Abraham of the High Mountain (<i>Ṭuro d-Rom</i>), the teacher of <ref type="cr">Barṣawmo</ref>, were brough<ab type="infobox"/>t there and housed in a larger church built next to that of Abel. According to the ‘Life of Philoxenos of Mabbug’, Philoxenos’s head was brought to Midyat after Mabbug had been taken by the Arabs and housed in a church built for the purpose, but was transferred to the Monastery of Mor Abrohom after its desecration in a raid on the town in 1145.</p>
<p>A bishopric specifically for Midyat is first mentioned as one of the six sees that separated to form the patriarchate of Ṭur ʿAbdin in the schism of 1364. Of the five patriarchs of Ṭur ʿAbdin between 1584 and 1791, four were from Midyat. Since 1923, Midyat has been the seat of the bishops of Ṭur ʿAbdin along with the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref>.</p>
<p>Tfinkdji reported in 1914 that in a total population of 8,000, there were 6,000 Syr. Orth., 450 Protestants, and about 100 each of Syr. Catholics and Chaldeans. Midyat lost a large part of its population i<ab type="infobox"/>n the <ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref><ab type="infobox"/>, but until the 1960s Christians continued to constitute the majority of the population. In 2005, there were reported to be ca. 100 Christian families in a total population of over 50,000.</p>
<p>The churches within the township are: 1. Mort Shmuni (Syr. Orth. cathedral); 2. Mor Barṣawmo (near center of town, rebuilt in 1943); 3. Mor Aksnoyo (i.e. Philoxenos of Mabbug, at eastern edge of town, rebuilt in 1960s); 4. Yoldat Aloho (‘little church’, to the south of town); 5. Mor Sharbel (in northern part of town, 1950s); and 6. Yoldat Aloho (north of Mor Sharbel, Protestant, 1900). In the immediate vicinity of the town are the former Monastery of Mor Sharbel to the north of the town (now military base) and the Monastery of Mor Abrohom (w-Hobil), ca. 1 km. east of the town, with churches dedicated to Mor Abel, Mor Abrohom, and Yoldat Aloho. Among the ms. treasures of Midyat is the illuminated Gospel lectionary of 1227.</p>

<p>He was born in Sharansh al-ʿUlya near Zakho and named Hurmiz. His father Paul was a priest. Mingana joined the <ref type="cr">Seminary of St. John</ref> in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> in 1891, where he studied Syriac under <ref type="cr">Awgen Manna</ref> and later succeeded him, when the latter became bp. in 1902. Mingana continued teaching there until 1908. Mingana was ordained a priest in 1902 by Patr. Emmanuel Toma, and adopted the name Alphonse. Mingana traveled in the area collecting mss. He managed to collect 70 mss. 20 of which were on parchment, but they all perished in World War I. Mingana worked as copy-editor at the Dominican Press from 1903–10. In 1907, Mingana published the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref> (in his <i>Sources syriaques</i>, I) which has caused much controversy. Apparently, Mingana had a scribe make the ms. on whose authority he published the text look as if it belonged to the 10th cent., though it was done at his time. This publication also put him at odds with his Patr. and he was asked to leave the seminary. In 1913, armed only with the address of <ref type="cr">James</ref> <ref type="cr">Rendel Harris</ref>, he left the East to live in Birmingham, UK. There he first worked with Rendel Harris on the <ref type="cr">Odes of Solomon</ref>, and later with <ref type="cr">Agnes Smith Lewis</ref> and <ref type="cr">Margaret Dunlop Gibson</ref>on Islamic texts. Between 1915 and 1924, he was appointed to catalog the Arabic mss. of the John Rylands Library, and then between 1924 and 1929 he undertook three expeditions to the east collecting Syriac and Arabic (both Christian and Islamic) mss., which would become the Mingana Collection at Selly Oak Colleges. Mingana then turned his attention to cataloguing his collection (3  vols.; 1933–39), and began publishing some of its texts in the series Woodbrooke Studies. Seven volumes appeared in the series.</p>

<p>Professor of Near-Eastern languages at Lund University, Sweden, 1908–37, and Vice Chancellor of the same university, 1926–36. In his research, Moberg dedicated himself mainly to Syriac and Arabic. He started his career under the mentorship of K. V. Zetterstéen at Uppsala University and submitted an edition of an Arabic Mamluk text as his doctoral dissertation in 1902. Throughout his career, Moberg continued to work on Arabic materials. He also translated classical and popular Arabic literature into Swedish and was known as a distinguished lecturer. His main scholarly contributions, however, were in the field of Syriac. With his research on the Syriac grammar of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> and on ‘The Book of the Ḥimyarites’ (see <ref type="cr">Ḥimyar</ref>), he became famous as a Syriac scholar whose achievements continue to play a role in contemporary Syriac scholarship.</p>
<p>One of Moberg’s main contributions was his study of the Syriac grammar of Bar ʿEbroyo. Between 1907 and 1913 he translated the text into German along with text-critical notes (2 vols.). In 1922, he expanded his studies in this field by producing a complete critical edition of the Syriac text based on a wide range of mss. Bar ʿEbroyo’s grammar is a pioneering work in which the author seeks to regenerate Syriac grammar by using the methods and the terminology of the classical Arabic grammarians.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1920, Moberg was asked to examine a Syriac ms. containing a collection of well-known liturgies. More interesting were the fragments in the boards of the volume that consisted of portions of much older mss. Having taken out, cleaned, and treated the leaves in the boards of the ms., Moberg discovered that most of them belonged to a work on the Ḥimyarite martyrs of <ref type="cr">Nagran</ref>. In 1924, Moberg published an edition, translation, and study of these fragments, which shed new light on the history of South Arabia in the 6th cent. This study is the one most connected to Moberg’s name and the one that has had the most lasting influence on other scholarly research.</p>

<LemmaTitle>Monasticism
</LemmaTitle><p>Institutionalized form of religious life, devoted to disciplined ascetic prayer practice. An ascetic form of Christian living, including vows of celibacy and poverty (or simplicity) in service of the church, had characterized early Syriac Christianity by the 2nd or 3rd cent. During the 4th cent., as for Christians elsewhere, this type of religious vocation began to organize in desert and wilderness areas apart from urban contexts. <ref type="cr">Yulyana Saba</ref> (d. 367) was one of the first to establish a community of disciples in the desert of Osrhoene. By the 5th cent., varieties of monasticism were flourishing in the Syrian Orient, and documents containing monastic rules indicate the efforts to institutionalize and order these under the supervision of bishops. In Syrian tradition, a ‘monastery’ was a community of two or more individuals pursuing a life of prayer. Individual hermits or ascetics were often loosely connected to monasteries, which then provided for their needs. Sometimes monasteries became very large and assumed roles such as landowners or providing schools. They were often centers of learning for both men and women and contained important ms. collections. Rich traditions of mysticism and prayer devotion flourished in late antique and medieval E. and W. Syr. monasteries. Syr. monasticism was notable for its close engagement with civic life (villages, towns, cities), and for constant, intimate interaction with lay people of every kind — a characteristic still apparent in the monasteries of<ref type="cr"> Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> in eastern Turkey, or the Monastery of Mor Ephrem in Glane-Losser, Holland.</p>

<p>City in the north of Iraq, on the west bank of the Tigris opposite the ruins of ancient <ref type="cr">Nineveh</ref>. Its Arabic name <i>al-Mawṣil</i> means ‘the link’, possibly on account of its strategic location on a trade route linking southern Iraq with Syria and Anatolia. Before the Arab era, the site of Mosul was occupied by a modest fortress called in Syriac sources <i>ḥesnā ʿebrāyā</i> ‘Across-the-Fortress’, near which a ‘Ninevite’ monk named Ishoʿyahb bar Qusri built a monastery at the end of the 6th cent. His name still survives in the form Eshaʿya, lit. ‘Isaiah’, though the modern church that bears this name is from a later period. Other names were given to this pre-Islamic settlement, including Nu-Ardashir, Bu-Ardashir, or simply Ardashir. In 637 the Arab armies conquered Mosul which became part of the province of al-Jazīra, the capital of which was <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>. At the time of the Arab conquest, the city was inhabited by a large E.-Syr. community and by a smaller Syr. Orth. one under the influence of <ref type="cr">Dayro 
d-Mor Matay</ref>. The E.-Syr. diocese of Nineveh, which may well have been situated in the ruins of the ancient Assyrian palace area, moved to Mosul soon after its conquest; its first bp. was none other than <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> of <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref> who became Patr. in 649. During the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, Mosul was of prime importance, being a trade, commercial, and agricultural center, and the city prospered in people and buildings. From 1127 to 1233, the city was ruled by the Atabeg Dynasty founded by ʿImād-al-dīn Zangī, and the time of the governor and then Sultan of Mosul Badr al-dīn Luʾluʾ (1199–1259) was a golden age of art and architecture, reflected in both Islamic and Christian religious buildings. The city was sacked by the Mongols in 1258, and in 1534 it became part of the Ottoman empire. In 1743 the Persian Nadir-Shah Tahmasp invaded northern Mesopotamia as a consequence of tense relations between Persia and the Ottomans and besieged Mosul for nine consecutive days. The heroic resistance of the population, both Muslim and Christian, defeated the enemy, and as a consequence, these were allowed to rebuild their churches and mosques in Mosul and in the surrounding villages. The brilliant art and architecture reflected in dozens of these buildings has survived to this day and is typical of this era called Jalīlī, after the name of its brave governor Husayn Beg al-Jalīlī. During the 19th and early 
20th cent., the Christians of Mosul greatly contributed to the revival of the Arab culture undermined for centuries by the Ottomans, creating the first newspaper and theater, and printing popular books through which they promoted the Arabic language and literature. After the invasion of Iraq by the Allied forces in 2003, the Christians of Mosul became targets of assassination, kidnapping, and extortion, and the city’s Chald. bp., two of its priests, and many of its deacons and lay people fell ­victim to the violence.</p>

<p>Born in Batḥa, near Ghosṭa, in Lebanon, Mubārak was sent to the Maronite College in Rome at a very young age, in 1672. After his studies, he returned to Lebanon in 1685, and was ordained a priest by Patr. <ref type="cr">Isṭifān al-Duwayhī</ref> in 1687. During a second stay in Rome, on behalf of the Maronite Church, he established contact with Cosimo III, the Duke of Tuscany, who in 1698 appointed him to the chair of Oriental languages at the University of Pisa. He resigned from the university in 1707 and entered into the Jesuit order, which brought him back to Rome. In 1730, at the request of Cardinal Querini, he started working on the so-called ‘Roman’ edition of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>’s works. To this project <ref type="cr">J. S. Assemani</ref> contributed Ephrem’s Greek works, with Latin translations (in 3 vols.: 1732, 1743, and 1746), while Mubārak was in charge of the Syriac, again with Latin translations. The first two volumes appeared in 1737 and 1740. After Mubārak’s death, the third Syriac volume was seen through the press by <ref type="cr">S. E. Assemani</ref> (1743).

<ab type="infobox"/>[formerly Syr. Orth., now Syr. Catholic]
<p>The Monastery of Moses the Ethiopian is perched on top of a steep, rocky promontory that juts out of a deep gully between two cliffs in the high region south of Nabk. The earliest historical reference to the monastery is in a hand-written note beside a text of <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref> on the Gospel of Matthew, in a 6th-cent. ms. preserved in the British Library. A second note in the same ms. states that this volume was ‘the property of the convent of Mushe, on the hill called “the Great Head,” east of Natpha, in the province of Damascus’. The subsequent history of the monastery is closely documented by numerous inscriptions within the church, and by mss. that once belonged to its flourishing scriptorium. Until the end of the 14th cent. it was the seat of a bishopric that later fell under the jurisdiction of Ḥama and <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, and then under the bishopric of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> and <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref> (Kaufhold).</p>
<p>The monastery prospered well into the 18th cent. and was recorded by both Burton and Moritz late in the 19th cent., but some time thereafter was totally abandoned and fell into ruin. The fortress-like building was approached through a small door on the top floor, from where it was built four stories down; but when discovered again in 1981, the lower floors had all caved in and the upper terrace had only one room that sheltered sheep. At that time the chapel was still preserved, its walls decorated with falling, painted stucco but the roof and the ciborium were gone, burned for firewood. A young Jesuit, Father Paolo dall’Oglio, an Orientalist by training, visited the site and decided to restore the monastery to its former state. With great care to reproduce its original plan and accoutrements, and with the help of local teams of Christian volunteers from Syria and Iraq, with experts in the Department of Antiquities in Damascus, and the Istituto del Restauro in Rome, Father Paolo cleared the lower rooms and rebuilt the upper stories and the chapel. In subsequent years he dug a well, added outlying buildings, and established a new order for the monastery. He now presides over a small group of monks, nuns, and novitiates in a religious center dedicated to serving the surrounding community of Christians and Muslims and to promoting a dialogue between them. The monastery receives daily a great number of visitors, both Christian and Muslim.</p>
<p>For as long as the inhabitants of Nabk can remember, the monastery has been known as Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī (St. Moses the Ethiopian), but, according to the inscriptions and to the mss., it was originally dedicated to Mār Mūsā the Prophet (St. Moses the Prophet). The earliest reference to Moses the Ethiopian comes from the 17th cent. It is possible that this saint became associated with the monastery on the arrival of a number of Abyssinian monks in the 15th cent. (Cruikshank Dodd). These monks from Mar Girgios al-Ḥabash, in Ehden, and Mar Yaʿqub al-Ḥabash in Bsharre, were evicted from the Qadisha valley by the Maronites in 1488. In this case the change of name from Mār Mūsā, to Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabash (of the Ethiopians), to Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashi (the Ethiopian) might have come about naturally in the process of time. A hand encased in a silver casket purporting to be the hand of Mar Moses the Ethiopian is inscribed as a donation to the monastery by Bp. Eliya in 1817 and is now preserved in the Church of the Virgin, in Nabk. The Syr. Orth. Christians of Nabk celebrate the feast of Moses the Ethiopian on 28 Aug. 
In the Greek Church his feast day is 18 June.</p>
<p>The various stages in the monastery’s long history are recorded in inscriptions. Those carved in the building stones indicate that the church was rebuilt and renovated in A.H. 504 (= AD 1058/1059). Subsequently, it was enlarged and turned into a fortress in the 15th cent. and restored again in the 16th. Inscriptions painted on the wall paintings identify the figures and scenes. Earlier layers of painting are inscribed in Greek, whereas the top layer for the most part uses Syriac. There are also dedications and memorials written on the paintings themselves by various visitors to the monastery, in Syriac and in Arabic, that contribute to the history of the monastery (Tweir, Haddad, Muwazzin, ter Haar Romeny et al).</p>
<p>With this long and fascinating history, the chapel in Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī also preserves until today the most extensive series of paintings to have come down to us from the whole of the Levant (Cruikshank Dodd, Dall’Oglio, Westphalen, Immerzeel). The chapel is unique in that it shows a well-documented, coherent series of paintings from more than one period, paintings that are indispensable for the study of medieval Christian art.</p>
<p>There are three (or three and a half) principal layers of painting, applied at three different periods (Westphalen). The first, or earliest layer of paintings (layer 1), can be dated to the 11th cent. ca. 1060, soon after the first renovations to the church, to which more wall paintings were added a few years later (1a), at some time before 1095. Another layer (2) is dated by an inscription on the Baptismal scene to 1095. The latest series (3) is the most extensive and best preserved. The date of the third layer is recorded in an inscription over a painting of the Evangelist Matthew, and it may be read as either 1192 (assuming that the Seleucid calendar is followed), or 1208/9 (if it is taken as a Hijra year), a distinction which is, unfortunately, not clear in the original.</p>
<p>The interior of the chapel was elaborately painted when it was first restored in 1058/9. Beneath the more recent remains of the third layer, there is a bust of Christ on the triumphal arch with what appear to be archangels at either side. Above these figures there may have been painted the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste (Immerzeel). An Annunciation was placed on either side of the window. The riding saints, Theodore and George, appear opposite each other on the spandrels of the arches in the nave, where also the remains of a second pair may be traced from this early date. Still in the nave, on the southern spandrel nearest to the apse is the Ascension of Elijah in his Chariot. In the southern aisle, west end, an early representation of the Presentation in the Temple (?) is balanced by a group of apostles, probably the Pentecost, at the west end of the northern aisle. In the southern aisle, an image of Samson and the Lion is painted high above the western arch. At the east end, there may have been an early Baptism in the northern aisle and an early Myrophores (Three Women at the Tomb) in the southern aisle. The columns and the soffits of the arches are decorated with standing saints and martyrs, both male and female most of whom were added shortly after this first layer (period 1a).</p>
<p>Layer 2 (1095) comprises a large Baptism, painted over the earlier Baptism at the eastern end of the northern aisle, and a renewed Myrophores painted over the earlier one in the southern aisle. A stylite Saint (<ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>?) stands beside the Baptism. At the western end of the southern aisle is a renewed Presentation in the Temple.</p>
<p>Most of the extant paintings belong to layer three, the last layer of paint, 1192 or 1208/9. They present the most coherent series of paintings to have come down to us in the Syriac churches. The triumphal arch, high up under the eaves, is decorated with Christ Emmanuel and an Annunciation, below which is the Christ Pantocrator between the figures of twelve standing apostles that spill into the nave. In the apse was a Deesis (now largely destroyed) with the Christ on a throne surrounded by the four beasts of the Apocalypse. Below them, in the bema, the standing Virgin Blachernitissa between standing Church Fathers: <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, <ref type="cr">Basil</ref>, <ref type="cr">Athanasius</ref>, and <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref>, on her right.; and <ref type="cr">Ignatius</ref>, James, and two others (destroyed) on her left. On the iconastasis there are painted the five wise and five foolish virgins. Four large riding horsemen, George and Theodore, Bacchos and Sergios charge down the nave, above the arches, towards the apse. The remains of two other riding saints are visible nearer the apse, making six in all. Four evangelists writing their gospels fill the spandrels. On the western wall is a great Last Judgment above which is the <i>Traditio clavium</i> and the <i>Traditio Legis</i>, of which only the lower part of Peter and Paul remain. Below them the remaining ten Apostles are seated on either side of a Hetoimasia between Adam and Eve. On the one side, below the apostles, are the three patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, together with Mary, holding bunches of souls in their laps. Beneath them are the saints, martyrs and holy men ascending from their tombs to heaven at the blast of trumpeting angels. On the other side of the Hetoimasia stand heretical bishops and various groups of enemies of the orthodox churches, along with Satan seated among souls drowning in the waters of the Styx, a devil holding down the scales, and below them are naked women symbolizing the seven sins. The Last Judgment spills over onto the walls of the nave.</p>
<p>Among these impressive scenes, the walls and the piers in Mār Mūsā are painted with numerous figures of standing saints and martyrs, including John the Baptist and Saba, Euthymios and Anthony (?). The soffits of the arches are reserved for female saints, among them: Anastasia, Catherine, Barbara, Elizabeth, and Julia 
(Juliana).</p>
<p>These paintings are evidence of a continuing tradition of Christian painting in lands dominated by Muslim rulers. In their iconography, they kept alive the painterly tradition of the Early Christian Church and also followed closely Byzantine innovations from Constantinople. In the 12th cent., some iconographic elements were imported from Crusader <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>. In their style, each of the layers of paint demonstrate a stylistic tradition in East Christian art that was aware of and sensitive to regional developments in Lebanon, Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq and Cappadocia. The painters were local Syrians who were also influenced by contemporary Islamic art in the region. On the whole, the paintings of Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī remain the richest illustration of East Christian art preserved until today.</p>

<p>Bp. of Beth Raman (north of <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref> on the Tigris), and writer. Almost all that is known about him comes from a short anonymous biography (in two recensions, BHO 779–80) transmitted with his works. According to this, he was born in the town of <ref type="cr">Balad</ref> (modern Eski Mosul) and entered the Monastery of Mar Sargis on the ‘Dry Mountain’ (that is, Buṭmān, 15 km. northeast of Balad on the west bank of the Tigris). He became a monk at age twenty, then ten years later, bp., taking the name Severos. His diocese of Beth Raman was suffragan to the metr. of Tagrit. Other sources add to his diocese variously Beth Kiyonaye (that is, Beth Bawazig or Beth Waziq, a neighbouring town), <ref type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>. He died on 12 Feb. 903 at the age of seventy (or acc. to other sources, ninety). This date puts his birth in ca. 833 and his consecration as bp. in ca. 863.</p>
<p>Mushe’s writings cover a wider area of biblical exegesis, traditional theology, and liturgy than any previous Syriac writer had attempted to span. Perhaps he was aiming at a <i>summa</i> that would defend the Christian religion within the Muslim world. His works are characterized by divisions into short ‘chapters’ or other sections, treating specific points in a formulaic way, often by question and answer. Mushe is regarded as one of the great scholars of the Syr. Orth. Church. This scholarship was, however, largely a matter of compiling excerpts from sources, and modern studies of his works have generally been concerned with the analysis of these sources. They included E.-Syr. ones, which is not so surprising given that Mushe’s career was spent on the E. edge of Syr. Orth. territory.</p>

<p>Priest, scribe, and bp. A native of the village of Qāluq, in the region of Ṣawro, near <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, Mushe was sent by Patr. <ref type="cr">ʿAbdullāh I bar Sṭephanos</ref> to Rome, where he arrived with a few mss. in or shortly before 1549. The aim of the mission was to search for Syriac printed books or for opportunities to produce them. Whether Mushe was additionally entrusted with the delicate task of improving relations between the Syr. Orth and the Roman Catholic Church remains disputed. Mushe lived in Rome and traveled through Europe until some time after 1556.</p>
<p>In Rome, he established contacts with some of the earliest Western scholars interested in Syriac. Among them were Guillaume Postel, Johann Albrecht Widman­stetter, and <ref type="cr">Andreas Masius</ref>. He collaborated with Widmanstetter in the publication of the first edition of the Syriac NT, which appeared in Vienna in 1555 and whose Syriac typeface derived from Mushe’s handwriting. Mushe served as Masius’s Syriac teacher in Rome, and the latter frequently consulted him, in particular while he was preparing his <i>Syrorum Peculium</i>, a Syriac glossary that was included in vol. 6 of the Antwerp Polyglot (1571). Mushe and Masius corresponded in Syriac; a number of letters, belonging to the period 1553–55, are preserved. Masius also translated into Latin a profession of faith that Mushe is said to have made in 1552 and which Masius included in one of his later publications; its exact status remains unclear.</p>
<p>During his time in Europe, Mushe copied many Syriac mss. Several of these are extant, including the remarkable ms. London, Brit. Libr. Harley 5512, which contains parts of the Roman Missal in Latin, written in Serṭo script, along with three Syriac Anaphoras. Mushe wrote it for the bp. of the Abyssinian Convent (San Stefano) in Rome, where he often resided, and it shows his interest in, and familiarity with, the Catholic liturgy.</p>
<p>After 1556 Mushe returned to the Middle East, where he copied some further mss. (among them <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>’s Chronicle, probably from the author’s autograph) and where the (solely honorific?) title of metropolitan bp. was conferred on him. He returned to Rome, probably in the company of Patr. <ref type="cr">Niʿmatullāh</ref>, following the latter’s abdication, in 1578. In Rome he copied and annotated several more Syriac and Arabic mss. He died in or shortly after 1592, possibly in Rome.</p>

[Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Scribe, abbot of <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>, collector of mss. Mushe’s presence in Dayr al-Suryān, the ‘Monastery of the Syrians’ in the Egyptian Wadi al-Natrun, is attested from the beginning of the 10th cent., when he worked as a scribe (903/4) and was instrumental in the donation to the monastery of a 6th-cent. biblical ms. (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,142) by a Tagriti family (906/7). A  few years later, he was abbot (<i>ri</i><i>š dayro</i>) and was in charge of a major renovation project in the main church. This is recorded in two inscriptions dated 914 and 926/7. Mushe’s name may perhaps also be found in a majestic Coptic inscription inside the dome of the church, which reads: <i>Papa Moyses pi-hikoymenos</i> ‘Papa Moses the hegoumenos’. The latest mention of Mushe as abbot is found in a note dated 943/4 (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,525, f. 1v).</p>
<p>Shortly after 926/7, Mushe traveled to <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> in order to appeal, on behalf of the Egyptian monasteries, against new taxes imposed by Caliph al-Muqtadir. The information provided by notes in Syriac mss. is corroborated by the Muslim historian al-Maqrīzī, though he does not mention Mushe by name. In the course of the long negotiation process in Baghdad, which turned out to be successful, Mushe traveled around collecting mss. for the library of Dayr al-Suryān. In 931/2, he returned with 250 mss. These mss., bought or received as gifts in <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref>, <ref type="cr">Reshʿayna</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>, and many other locations in Mesopotamia, at once made Dayr al-Suryān into a major treasure house of Syriac Christian culture. Even though Syriac mss. arrived at Dayr al-Suryān both before and after Mushe, his was by far the largest single addition to the library. In each of the 250 mss. Mushe himself wrote a lengthy note recording the acquisition (in this process he more than once erased older notes, thereby destroying evidence of the ms.’s previous history). The fact that more than seventy of these notes have survived to the present day lends credibility to the reported number of 250. In the course of the 18th and 19th cent., most of the Syriac mss. from Dayr al-Suryān were transferred to major western libraries. A small collection, however, still exists in the monastery today. As the most well-known representative of the Syrian abbots and of the Syrian and Coptic monks who collected, produced, and preserved Syriac mss. in Dayr al-Suryān, Mushe played a unique role in providing present-day Syriac scholars with an impressive number of sources of very great antiquity.</p>

<p>City in S. Arabia (Syr. <i>Nagran</i>, or <i>Negran</i>; Arab. <i>Najrā</i><i>n</i>), and city in Iraq. In Christian and Muslim sources different legends circulate regarding the introduction of Christianity to the S. Arabian city. According to the ‘Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref>’, Ḥannan, a merchant from Nagran, received baptism in the early 5th cent. in <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref> and subsequently brought his new religion, of the E.-Syr. type, to Nagran. In the 5th cent. we also hear of the presence of Jews in Nagran.</p>
<p>Nagran became widely known in the Christian world as the central stage for the persecution of Christians by the king of <ref type="cr">Ḥimyar</ref> in either 518 or 523 (the date is disputed). Accounts of the martyrdom of Christians in Nagran, which also include several female martyrs, are preserved in two Syriac letters and in the ‘Book of the Ḥimyarites’. A few years later, Ḥimyarite supremacy on the Arabian Peninsula ended and S. Arabia became an Ethiopian protectorate. In 572 it was conquered by the Persians; in 628 it came under Muslim rule.</p>
<p>The Syriac sources present the persecuted Christians of Nagran as anti-Chalcedonian, Miaphysite. There is some evidence that Miaphysitism in Nagran was of the Aphthartodocetic type, i.e. in agreement with the doctrine of <ref type="cr">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref>. As the controversy between <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> and Julian only broke out in the 520s, this would not yet have been the case in the time of the persecution.</p>
<p>Christianity in Nagran was known in early Muslim sources. Surah 85:4–9 of the Qurʾān is often understood as referring to the persecuted Christians of Nagran, i.e. ‘the men of the furnace’ (<i>al-’ukhdūd</i>). In 630, Christians from Nagran are said to have traveled to Medina, to meet the Prophet Muḥammad, with whom they concluded a pact, allowing them to practice their religion. The existence of this pact, known in both Muslim and Christian sources, gave rise to the creation of apocryphal documents, such as those preserved in the ‘Chronicle of Siirt’ (PO 13, 601–18). A few years later, however, during the caliphate of ʿUmar (634–44), the Christians from Nagran were forced to leave the Peninsula, even though a small number may have remained for some time. They settled near Ḥirta, in Iraq, in a city that they called Nagran after their first home. In the late 8th cent., Patr. <ref type="cr">Timotheos</ref> was able to integrate the descendants of the exiles into the Ch. of E. In one of his letters, datable perhaps to 791/92, he reports that they had given up their adherence to Julianism and asked him to consecrate a bp. For the 9th and 10th cent., however, the names of four Syr. Orth. bishops are preserved in the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, indicating that either the Nagranites had changed allegiance once again, or that two hierarchies co-existed in the Iraqi city.</p>

<Author>G. A. Kiraz</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Narsai</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. ca. 500) [Ch. of E.]<CharStyle:Lemma info 1 Char>
<p>Poet and teacher of exegesis at the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref> and at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>; author of popular verse homilies (<i>memre</i>). The main sources for our knowledge of Narsai’s life are the two works attributed to <ref type="cr">Barḥadbshabba</ref> (the Ecclesiastical History and the ‘Cause of the foundation of the schools’) which, however, differ from each other at several points and are not always reliable.</p>
<p>Born in ʿAyn Dulba, near Maʿalta in northern Mesopotamia (within Persian territory), Narsai was orphaned at the age of sixteen and educated by his uncle, the abbot of the Monastery of Kfar Mari, west of the Tigris. At an unknown date he went to study in the School of Edessa, where he spent many years, first as a student and later as a teacher and director (‘Rabban’). His directorship, which probably did not begin before ca. 450, is said to have lasted twenty years, and came to an end with his expulsion. The date of this expulsion is uncertain; it may have taken place at any time between the death of the Dyophysite bp. <ref type="cr">Hiba</ref> of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, in 457, and the official closure of the School in 489. Vööbus (46) suggests a date some time after 471. Following his expulsion, Narsai was well received in <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> by bp. <ref type="cr">Barṣawma</ref>, who persuaded him to found a new school in this city. Even though there was a fall out between Narsai and Barṣawma, which the sources blame on the bp.’s wife, Mamai, and which resulted in Narsai’s temporary absence from Nisibis, he remained the head of the new School until his death (ca. 500). The statutes of the School, dated 496, contain Narsai’s name.</p>
<p>During his years in Edessa, Narsai was exposed to the theology and the biblical interpretation of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> (d. 428), whose works were translated into Syriac in and around the School of Edessa in the first half of the 5th cent. and had a lasting impact on Narsai. In the Ecclesiastical History attributed to Barḥadbshabba, <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (portrayed here in negative terms) is explicitly mentioned as the one who preceded Narsai in composing <i>memre</i> and triggered Narsai’s response with compositions in this same genre (ed. F. Nau [PO 9.5], 612; ET in Becker 2008, 69). Narsai and Yaʿqub (who also spent some time in Edessa, probably in the 460s) are representative of the two different approaches to Theodore’s legacy: while for Narsai and the later E.-Syr. (Dyophysite) tradition Theodore became the most authoritative theologian and exegete, Yaʿqub and the later (Miaphysite) W.-Syr. tradition rejected him and instead remained closer to <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>’s writings (which inspired the E. Syrians as well) and found their main theological authority in <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref> (who sometimes is the explicit target of attack in Narsai’s <i>memre</i>). Even though it is unknown whether Narsai and Yaʿqub ever met in person in Edessa, they share a number of themes, motifs, and approaches, which must reflect their common Edessene background.</p>
<p>Narsai’s <i>memre</i> focus on salvation history as an ongoing learning process for humanity, in which Christ’s incarnation, with his two natures (God and man) preserved intact, is the key moment. Many <i>memre</i> deal with biblical interpretation, either OT or NT; others are devoted to specific liturgical feasts or address topics of theological or moral significance. One <i>memrā</i> (no. 11 in Mingana’s list; ed. F. Martin) is a defense of the three Antiochene teachers, <ref type="cr">Diodore of Tarsus</ref>, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>. Narsai’s <i>memre</i> represent an important phase in the formation of E.-Syr. theological and exegetical tradition, which depended heavily on the thought of Theodore, but also was shaped by the E.-Syrians’ ‘agency and creativity in this process of reception’ (Becker, 125). The <i>memre</i> were widely read and used in the later tradition, e.g., by Cath. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>, who mentions and quotes them in his letters, by <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, who often relies on them in his own commentaries, and by <ref type="cr">Emmanuel bar Shahhare</ref>, for whom Narsai served as a model (and in whose collection of <i>memre</i> one of Narsai’s <i>memre</i> [no. 81] became entangled).</p>
<p>At present, 81 <i>memre</i> by Narsai are known to exist in mss., gathered together in collections intended for liturgical use. The majority are in the dodecasyllabic meter, while the rest are heptasyllabic. A. Mingana, who provided the first list of all existing <i>memre</i>, edited 47 of them in his 1905 publication. Several <i>memre</i> were edited separately, in particular by Ph. Gignoux (1968), F. G.  McLeod (1979), E. P.  Siman (1984), and J.  Frishman (1992). 
A 1970 facsimile edition of a recent ms. includes 72  <i>mem­re</i> (several of them not published elsewhere). While 
W. F. Macomber in 1973 provided an inventory of all then known mss. containing Narsai’s <i>memre</i>, S. P. Brock’s 2009 ‘Guide to Narsai’s homilies’ gives a convenient synopsis of all existing editions and translations, taking the Mingana list of 81 <i>memre</i> (which was also adopted by Macomber) as its starting point.</p>
<p>Apart from the <i>memre</i>, a number of <i>sugyoto</i> carry Narsai’s name (ten are included in Mingana’s edition, vol.  2, 366–411), but most of these are very likely not his. In addition, a collection of four <i>memre</i> on Joseph (Gen. 37–48) has been attributed to Narsai and published under his name. This attribution cannot be substantiated (see the most recent and thorough analysis in K. S. Heal, <i>Tradition and transformation: Genesis 37 and 39 in early Syriac sources</i> [Ph. D. dissertation, Birmingham; 2008], 33–68, with further references).</p>

<p>Bp. of Sirzor; biblical interpreter. Nathniel studied at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> and he probably continued working in the field of biblical interpretation after his graduation, but no details are known. As bp. of Sirzor he attended the synods of 585 (under <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb I</ref>) and 605 (under <ref type="cr">Grigor I</ref>) and signed the acts. At some later point during his tenure he was imprisoned (for having expelled from his city a Persian commander who had destroyed churches) and then put to death, still under the reign of Khusrau (r. 590–628), as is mentioned in the title of his surviving work.</p>
<p>The only text by Nathniel that has been preserved is a ‘Cause of the Psalms’ (<cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>Ellat mazmore</i>), which is a brief introduction to the Psalms. This is included in a larger collection of E.-Syr. introductory pieces to the Psalms, called ‘Book of causes of the Psalms’, which is found in a number of 19th-cent. mss. as a preamble to the Commentary on the Psalms by <ref type="cr">Denḥa</ref> (9th cent.?). The collection as a whole and the various mss. that contain it have been surveyed by Van den Eynde and Van Rompay. Nathniel’s text has been edited by Vandenhoff (with LT).</p>

<p>Syriac scholar, co-founder of the Patrologia Orientalis. Born in Lorraine, he studied theology at the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Paris and was ordained a priest in 1887. He then continued his studies in natural sciences at the Institut catholique in Paris from 1887 to 1894. He obtained a <i>licence</i> in mathematics, another one in physics, and received the doctor’s degree in mathematics in 1897. Throughout his life he taught mathematics at the Institut catholique, as well as in different schools in Paris. It was for a distraction that he began to study Syriac under <ref type="cr">René Graffin</ref>. On this occasion, he discovered the richness of scientific literature in Syriac. He earned the diploma of the École Pratique des Hautes Études in 1895 with the edition and French translation of the Syriac text of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s treatise on the ‘Ascent of the mind’ (<i>Suloqo hawnonoyo</i>), which was published in 1899. This was the beginning of a steady stream of publications in all fields of Syriac and Near Eastern studies, not only on sciences and cosmography but also on Apocrypha, canonical literature, hagiography, history, etc. His Syriac bibliography includes 240 books and articles, without counting the many entries that he wrote for the <i>Dictionnaire de la Bible</i>, <i>Dictionnaire de théologie catholique</i>, <i>Dictionnaire d’histoire et de géographie ecclésiastiques</i>, <i>Dictionnaire apolog</i><i>étique de la foi catholique</i>, and the many reviews published in the <i>Revue de l’Orient Chrétien</i>, <i>Journal asiatique</i>, and other periodicals. A large number of Nau’s publications contain the edition or study and translation of previously unknown texts, many of which he himself discovered in mss., mostly in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, but also in the British Museum, or in private collections. Of special interest are his supplement (1911) and his additions and corrections (1915) to the catalogue of Syriac mss. in Paris as well as his monographs on several of these mss. He published Syriac text editions and French translations of many narrative texts, including, among other texts, the ‘Book of the Laws of Countries’ associated with the school of <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>, lives of saints, ascetics, and ecclesiastical dignitaries (e.g. <ref type="cr">Marutha</ref> and <ref type="cr">Aḥudemmeh</ref>), letters of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, chronicles, texts of the Maron. and E.-Syr. traditions, and different versions of the history of <ref type="cr">Aḥiqar</ref> in Syriac. Several studies deal with natural sciences, i.e. cosmography and astronomy (including the publication of the ‘Treatise on the astrolabe’ and the ‘Treatise on Constellations’ by <ref type="cr">Severos</ref> <ref type="cr">Sebokht</ref>), with maps, with canonical literature (<ref type="cr">Didascalia Apostolorum</ref>, canonical resolutions), with calendars, synaxaries, menologies, and martyrologies. He also studied the documents of Central Asia, in particular the tomb stones of Kyrgyzstan. His editorial leadership is also essential. Together with <ref type="cr">René Graffin</ref>, he founded the Patrologia Orientalis. He also was the secretary and later the director of the <i>Revue de l’Orient Chrétien</i>. He contributed to both with numerous important publications.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The term Nestorianism refers to the idea, allegedly taught by <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>, that in the incarnate Christ the Son of God and the son of Mary represent two separate subjects. In western scholarship the term has often misleadingly and incorrectly been used to describe the teaching of the 
Ch. of E. In the christological controversies that followed the Council of Chalcedon (451) ‘Nestorian’ was used as a polemical term to brand as heretical any who held a strict dyophysite position (miaphysites indeed used it of <i>all</i> dyophysites). After the Arab conquests the label came to be employed solely for the Ch of E., and this usage has unfortunately been taken over in much western writing.

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Nestorios of Beth Nuhadra</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. ca. 800) 
[Ch. of E.] 
<p>From 790 until his death, Nestorios occupied the episcopal see of <ref type="cr">Beth Nuhadra</ref>. Before being admitted to this office, he had to be cleared from any mistrust concerning his orthodoxy. His formal abjuration of messalianism and other heterodox teachings (preserved among Patr. <ref type="cr">Timotheos</ref>’s letters and published by Braun) opened the way to his consecration and (as far as we know) uneventful tenure as bp., enjoying the support of his Patr.</p>
<p>This investigation should be seen in the context of the synod of 790/91, at which three mystics were condemned: <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref>, <ref type="cr">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref>, and (a certain) Yoḥannan Iḥidaya (the condemnation was later lifted under Timotheos’s successor). Since Nestorios had lived in the Monastery of Mar Yozadaq (in Beth Qardu), the home of Yoḥannan of Dalyatha, and also had known Yawsep Ḥazzaya, it is not surprising that he was associated with them.</p>
<p>In his ‘Book of Chastity’ <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref> of Baṣra attributes to Nestorios a no longer extant biography of Yawsep Ḥazzaya. Nestorios may have written it in defense of Yawsep when the latter became victim to accusations. One short treatise by Nestorios is preserved, ‘On the initial motion (<i>mettziʿānutā</i>) of God’s grace’. In it Nestorios argues that due to the ‘natural seeds’ that God instilled in us (weakened by sin but reinvigorated by Christ’s coming), we are able to receive God’s fire. He also maintains that man indeed is able to see God in a spiritual vision, a hotly debated question in Nestorios’s day. Nestorios certainly was ‘not a marginal’ figure in a period when the Ch. of E. was trying to strike a balance ‘between institution and prophecy’ (Berti).</p>

<p>Bp. of Constantinople from 428 to 431. Syriac sources put his birthplace in Germanicea (modern Kahramanmaraş) in the province of Euphratesia, although these sources may misunderstand the statement of the church historian Socrates, a contemporary of Nestorius, that his family came from that town (Ecclesiastical History, 7.29). There is no evidence that Nestorius could speak or write Syriac, despite his family background. In <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> he distinguished himself as an orator and perhaps planned a legal career before being drawn to the vibrant monastic life of the city. Although it is not clear that Nestorius studied under <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> directly, his subsequent insistence on the two natures firmly placed him within Theodore’s intellectual milieu.</p>
<p>When Sisinnius of Constantinople died on 24 Dec. 427, several candidates vied for his position, including Philip, future bp. of Side, and <ref type="cr">Proclus</ref> of Cyzicus. According to Nestorius himself, the emperor Theodosius personally intervened to have him brought to the capital as an outsider to cut through the acrimonious dispute between the factions. Ordained bp. on 10 April 428, Nestorius vigorously pursued pagans and heretics and likely induced the emperor to issue a new edict against a whole host of aberrant beliefs (Codex Theodosianus 16.5.66; 
20 May 428). He likely also celebrated the first liturgical commemoration for his fellow Antiochene and past bp. of Constantinople, <ref type="cr">John</ref> <ref type="cr">Chrysostom</ref>, on 26 Sept. 428.</p>
<p>Perhaps as early as the summer 428 members of Nestorius’s cadre in the capital, the presbyter Anastasius and Dorotheus of Marcianopolis, made denunciations of the appellation Theotokos (lit. ‘God-bearer’) for the Virgin Mary. By the winter of 428/9 sermons to this effect, some of which were almost surely by Nestorius, began circulating among the monasteries of Egypt. These soon elicited a critical reaction from <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, who addressed three letters to Nestorius, as well as others to Celestine of Rome in order to gain the pope’s support. Nestorius, however, refused to distance himself from the beliefs of his subordinates and continued to quibble with the legitimacy of Theotokos, and proposed instead a neologism, Christotokos (‘Christ-bearer’) as a compromise. In order to put to rest the growing controversy, the emperor summoned a council to meet at Ephesus in 431 to discuss the faith.</p>
<p>Nestorius refrained from attending not only Cyril’s council, which deposed him, but also, it seems, the counter-council convened by John of Antioch to fight his case. Instead he asked the emperor repeatedly to permit his retirement from the episcopate and his return to his monastery in Antioch, a request to which the emperor finally acquiesced in the late summer of 431. Nestorius lived just outside of Antioch until an imperial order of 435 exiled him to Petra. He was transferred later to the Oasis in Egypt, where, according to excerpts of his letters preserved in Evagrius Scholasticus (Ecclesiastical History, 1.7) he was captured by raiding tribes, and moved from Panopolis in the Thebaid to Elephantine, 320 km. to the south, and then back to Panopolis where he remained until his death late in the year 450.</p>

<p>Historian and peripatetic philosopher, who served as adviser to Herod the Great (74–4 BC). Excerpts from the Syriac version of his compendium covering <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>’s works on natural philosophy and metaphysics (‘On the philosophy of Aristotle’) are preserved in ms. Cambridge, Gg. 2.14 (copied in 15/16th cent.?). These excerpts include a passage of his ‘On plants’. Whether this work, which in its Latin version and Greek retroversion made from the Latin was later ascribed to Aristotle, originally constituted a separate work or was a part of the compendium is difficult to determine. Passages in the section of the compendium dealing with meteorology are accompanied by a large number of scholia which are often based on the commentary on Aristotle’s ‘Meteorologica’ by Olympiodorus (6th cent.). Two of these scholia are found explicitly attributed to <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> in another ms. (Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 346, dated 1309), while <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> attributes the translation of the compendium as a whole to Ḥunayn (<i>Mukhtaṣar ta</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>rīkh al-duwal</i>, ed. Beirut 1958, 82.15f.). It remains uncertain at the present state of research whether the scholia alone or both the scholia and the translation should be attributed to Ḥunayn. The Syriac version of the compendium was used extensively as a source by Bar ʿEbroyo in his ‘Candelabrum of the sanctuary’ and ‘Cream of wisdom’.</p>

[Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Scholar, astronomer, maph. (1555–7) and Patr. (1557–1576). Born in <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> to Maqdasī Yuḥanon Nūr al-Dīn, he joined <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> ca. 1535. Niʿmatullāh mastered the sciences and the arts, especially astronomy, medicine, philosophy, and painting. Upon becoming a Patr., he adopted the honorific name Ignatius. During his patriarchate, he visited Syria in 1562 and united the patriarchate of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> with his own in 1572, a union that lasted until 1584. He abdicated, or was forced to abdicate, in March 1576 under peculiar circumstances. <ref type="cr">Dolabani</ref> (<i>Patriarchen</i>, 206) narrates that the governor of <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>, a close friend of Niʿmatullāh, announced to the local Muslim notables who wished to execute the Patr. that Niʿmatullāh had adopted Islam. Niʿmatullāh gave no denial fearing execution and had to abdicate. Shortly after his abdication, he escaped in disguise and fled to the west. He arrived in Rome, coming from Venice, sometime between the end of 1576 and early 1578 carrying a recommendation from the Patr. of Aquileia. He was received in audience by Pope Gregory on 30  Jan. 1578.</p>
<p>Impressing others by his knowledge in medicine and mathematics, Niʿmatullāh was invited to join the papal commission on calendar reform. He wrote an extensive criticism of the Compendium, the reform proposal which was sent by Pope Gregory to all Catholic princes, in which he pointed out: 1. the anticipation of the equinox cannot be one day in 134 years; 2. the sun anticipates one day in 132 years according to observations in the East; 3. leaving out 10 leap days every 
40 years should be rejected; 4. turn-of-the-century adjustments are irregular; 5. the moon gains one day every 276  years, not 304; 6. the Compendium’s method of computing the 14th day of the lunation results in celebrating Easter before Passover; and 7. Easter may be celebrated a month later for the same reason. Niʿmatullāh also added to the list of authorities cited in the Compendium, Chapter 23 of the <ref type="cr">Didascalia Apostolorum</ref> and the acts of the Council of Nicaea. On 
14 Sept. 1580, Niʿmatullāh signed the final report of the commission with his colleagues; his signature, in Syriac and Arabic, was interpreted by the translator Leonardo Abel. Niʿmatullāh was probably involved in producing an Arabic edition in <ref type="cr">Garshuni</ref> of the papal decree on the new calendar with its rules sometime around or after 1583. Niʿmatullāh’s criticism of the Compendium in Garshuni is preserved at the Laurentiana Library, Florence; a Latin translation was made at the time by L. Abel and is preserved in the Vatican Archives, dated 12 March 1580.</p>
<p>Niʿmatullāh attempted to persuade the Syr. Orth. and Coptic churches to accept the new ‘Gregorian calendar’, but did not succeed. In 1583, his interpreter, Abel, was sent as a legate of the Pope to Syria with a letter from Niʿmatullāh to his successor Patr. Dawid Shah. Abel did not manage to meet with the Patr., but reported that, fearing the Turks, the Patr. refused to accept the calendar unless all other nations did so first.</p>

<p>A very ancient city in northern Iraq located on the eastern side of the Tigris River, directly across from the medieval and modern city of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>. The site owed its earliest development, from ca. 6000 BC, to its position beside a crossable portion of the Tigris (Oates 1968, 52). Nineveh reached its apex in the 7th cent. BC, when it served as the capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire under Kings Sennacherib (r. 705–681 BC), Esarhaddon (r. 681–69 BC), and Ashurbanipal (r. 668–27 BC). The rediscovery of its royal palaces played a central role in the development of modern Assyriology. In 1847, a thirty-year old Englishman named Austen Henry Layard began excavations at the site and almost immediately uncovered the remains of Sennacherib’s palace beneath the modern tell called Kuyunjik. Six years later, in 1853, Layard’s former assistant, Hormuzd Rassam, a Chaldean Christian from Mosul, excavated the palace of Ashurbanipal. Recent scholarship has finally given Rassam due credit for this discovery, an accomplishment obscured at the time by British Museum officials, who attacked Rassam as an ‘Oriental’ unqualified to run the excavation (Larsen 1994, esp. 317–32). British archaeologists continued to conduct intermittent excavations at Nineveh over the next century, followed by the Iraqis from the second half of the 1960s. American excavations (1987–1990) found dramatic evidence for Nineveh’s destruction in 612 BC, when a combined force of Medes, Elamites, and Babylonians burned and pillaged the city (Stronach and Lumsden 1992).</p>
<p>In both ancient and modern culture, Nineveh’s destruction has often served as an evocative paradigm for the sudden collapse of a mighty empire. But as stories about the destruction of Assyrian Nineveh percolated in Classical and Near Eastern folklore, the city itself experienced a long, slow recovery, eventually re-emerging as a significant urban center and then bishopric. Under the Seleucids, the city was re-founded as a <i>polis</i> and received ‘at least the superficial forms of Hellenistic city organization’ (Oates 1968, 61). Greek inscriptions and sculptural fragments attest to the strength of the city’s Hellenistic culture as late as the 2nd cent. AD (Reade 1998). Not surprisingly, Hellenistic and indigenous traditions often intertwined or merged (Reade 2001, 198).</p>
<p>By the early 3rd cent. AD, Christianity had established a significant presence in the surrounding territory of <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref>, which operated as a semi-autonomous kingdom, with its capital at <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref> (modern Erbil), until the Sasanian conquests of the 220s. When and how Christianity arrived in Nineveh remains unclear. Local tradition among the modern Christians of Mosul holds that a monastery dedicated to the Prophet Jonah was built on the tell of Nabī Yūnus during the 4th cent. (Fiey 1965, vol. 2, 497–8). But there is no indisputable textual or archaeological evidence for Christianity at the site until the mid-6th cent., when <ref type="cr">Aḥudemmeh</ref>, bp. of Nineveh, participated in the E.-Syr. synod of 554. Later bishops of the city included the future Patr. <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> (d.  659) and, briefly, the renowned 7th-cent. mystic <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref> (Fiey 1993, 115–16). At some stage before the mid-9th cent., the bishopric was merged with that of Mosul, which appears to have grown rapidly following its foundation as an Arab camp (<i>miṣr</i>) in the 640s.</p>
<p>Nineveh also served as the base for a Syr. Orth. bishopric, closely associated with the nearby <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> (Fiey 1965, 349–53; idem 1993, 239–40). One of the first holders of the bishopric, Mar Zakkay (593–605), distinguished himself as an intrepid polemicist against the ‘Nestorians’ (Fiey 1965, vol. 2, 783; idem 2004, 197–98). After the victory of the Emperor Heraclius at the Battle of Nineveh in 626, the Syr. Orth. expanded their presence throughout the entire region. A Syr. Orth. school established at Nineveh in the early 7th cent. had more than 300 students at its height in the mid–9th cent. (Fiey 1965, vol. 2, 499).</p>
<p>Local Christians recognized Nineveh as the former capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, but their understanding of this past was fragmentary, distorted, and sometimes fantastic. Stories about imperial Nineveh included the aphorisms of the Assyrian sage <ref type="cr">Aḥiqar</ref> and the Biblical books of Tobit and Jonah. Syr. Christians had long been fascinated by the story of the Ninevites’ repentance (Jonah 3:1–10), an episode that inspired a popular <i>memrā</i> by the poet <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> (d. 373). Sometime between the late 560s and the mid-7th cent., the Rogation of the Ninevites was adopted as a formal festival of the Ch. of E. to celebrate the passing of the plague (Fiey 1965, 498, esp. n. 5, on the problem of the dating). The Rogation, also known as the Fast of the Ninevites, continues to be celebrated with great intensity and three-day fasts in some E.-Syr. communities today.</p>
<p>The archaeology of Christianity at Nineveh has only recently begun to receive close attention (Simpson 2005). Christian objects found during the British excavations include fragments of a painted stucco cross and a small brass lamp with a cross-shaped lid. Unfortunately, the famous monastery of Jonah, which stood atop the modern tell of Nabī Yūnus, is known only from textual sources. In 701, the ill-fated E.-Syr. Patr. <ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ</ref> was buried in the monastery, and its chapel was restored by the Patr. Sargis (860–72). By this time, the monastery had also become a favorite haunt for the revelries of Islamic visitors, who penned enthusiastic verses about its wine (Fiey 1965, 2, 500). At some point in the 
10th cent., if not before, the monastery was transformed into an Islamic shrine (<i>masjad</i>) dedicated to the prophet Jonah (Nabī Yūnus). This mosque remains to this day a much-venerated shrine visited by members of all the religious communities of the region.</p>
<p>Gradually, beginning in late antiquity, the countryside surrounding Nineveh filled with a mixture of villages belonging to either the Ch. of E. or the Syr. Orth. Church, often living in close proximity to local Muslims, Jews, and Yazidis. Many of these villages developed strong local traditions of Christian architecture and scribal activity (Fiey 1965, vol. 2, 354–491). Even in the modern Diaspora, the distinct identity of many of these Christian villages, such as <ref type="cr">Telkepe</ref> and <ref type="cr">Qaraqosh</ref>, has not been forgotten.</p>

<p>City in Mesopotamia and important center of early Syriac Christianity. Birthplace, among others, of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> and site of the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>. The Syriac name <i>Nṣibin</i> can be traced back to Assyrian <i>Naṣibīna</i>, while the name <i>Ṣobā</i>, based on identification with biblical Ṣōbā (2 Sam. 8.1), seems to be of relatively late origin. Nisibis is located on a main east-west route in an area watered by the Çağçağ river (ancient Mygdonius), a tributary of the Khabur, which emerges from Mount Izla, or the southern slopes of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, on to the Mesopotamian plain just north of Nisibis. A border town in Turkey today opposite Syrian Qamishli, Nisibis was a frontier town in ancient times in an area contested between the Roman and Persian empires. Along with the monasteries on Mount Izla, it was also in an area where the spheres of influence of the E.-Syr. and W.-Syr. churches met. 
E. Syriacs, predominant at first, were later outnumbered by W. Syriacs among the dwindling population of Christians in the town.</p>
<p>Legends attribute the evangelisation of Nisibis to <ref type="cr">Addai</ref> or to his disciples Aggai and Mari. The first attested bp. of the city is <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> (308/9 – after 338) who attended the Council of Nicaea and is commemorated, along with his successors Babu and Vologeses (d. 361/2), by his pupil Ephrem in his <i>Carmina nisibena</i>. After its cession by Jovian to Shapur II in 363, Nisibis remained more or less permanently in Sasanian hands until the Islamic conquest in 640.</p>
<p>At the Ch. of E. synod of 410 Nisibis was made the metropolitan see of <ref type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref> with Arzun, Qardu, Beth Zabdai, Beth Rahimai, and Beth Moksaye as suffragans. The episcopate of <ref type="cr">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref> (ca. 450–91) saw the establishment of the School of Nisibis under the leadership of <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>. Under Islamic rule, with the disappearance of the Roman-Persian border, Nisibis gradually lost its strategic, as well as commercial, importance. Later occupants of the see include <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb bar Malkon</ref> (before 1222–47?), and <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>. When, between 1482 and 1489, Syr. Orth. Patr. Ignatius Sobo of Ṭur ʿAbdin attempted to gain control of the churches of St. Jacob and St. Domitius, the E. Syriacs were still numerous enough to resist this move. The E. Syr. see of Nisibis, Chald. by then, was finally suppressed in 1616.</p>
<p>The first appearance of a Syr. Orth. bishop of Nisibis (Abraham, 631) may be connected with the Roman advances made in the area under Emperor Heraclius. Bishops specifically for Nisibis are known from the end of the 8th cent. until the 11th cent., but in the 12th cent. ‘Nisibis’ is found among the titles of the metropolitans of <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>. From then on, no resident Syr. Orth. bp. of Nisibis is attested until 1860.</p>
<p>O. H. Parry found 300 Muslim, 150 Jewish, and 30 Syrian families in the town on a visit in 1892. The Christian community in the town, reported to number 200 families in 1915, disappeared after the First World War, although the presence of three Christian families after the Second World War is mentioned by Anschütz.</p>
<p>Little remains of the Christian past in Nisibis, but the Church of St. Jacob, incorporating the baptistery built in 359 and the crypt with the tomb of Yaʿqub of Nisibis, is still maintained as a church (Syr. Orth. since 1865). Excavations have been under way since 2000 in the area to the south of the church, the site of the original cathedral built by Yaʿqub of Nisibis in 312–20. The church of St. Febronia (4th cent. martyr) is now the Mosque of Zayn al-ʿĀbidīn.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The School of Nisibis was an E.-Syr. institution of learning founded in part by refugees from the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref> after the latter was forcibly closed by the religious and political authorities in 489, because it had become an exegetical circle of dyophysite Christians whose Antiochene theology was no longer welcome in a Roman Empire split by Christological controversy. The School of Nisibis flourished through the early 7th cent., after which time our sources become sparse. Aside from the actual school documents, numerous texts from the period and later refer to members of the Ch. of E., including those who would go on to become important authors, martyrs, bishops, and catholicoi, as studying at the School.</p>
<p>The most important sources for the School of Nisibis are: 1. the two sets of canons, similar to those of a monastery, instituted in 496 and 602, and material deriving from their later ratifications; 2. the last two chapters of the Ecclesiastical History of <ref type="cr">Barḥadbshabba</ref>, which consist of separate lives of <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>, the first head of the School and its founder along with <ref type="cr">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref>, and of <ref type="cr">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref>, its head for several decades in the 6th cent.; and 3. The so-called ‘Cause of the Foundation of the Schools’, attributed possibly to the sam<ab type="infobox"/>e Barḥadbshabba.</p>
<p>Study at the school was centered primarily around scripture and its interpretation. The sources refer to different types of teacher: the elementary instructor (<i>mhaggyānā</i>); the reader (<i>maqryā</i><i>nā</i>); and finally the exegete (<i>mpaššqānā</i>), who was the sole occupant of this office and the head of the School. Judging from the different offices of instruction and anecdotes from various texts, students acquired a broad range of learning at the school, from basic literacy to knowledge of the E.-Syr. exegetical tradition, the basics of Aristotelian logic, and the forms of composition and debate. The exegesis of the School was heavily based on the E.-Syr. reception of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> (d. 428), who was treated by many as <i>the</i> exegetical and theological authority. One genre associated with the School and other E.-Syr. schools seems to have been the ‘cause’ (<cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>elltā</i>), which was focused primarily on the aetiological discussion of E.-Syr. festival days.</p>
<p>We know little about the actual physical space of the School, for example, where it lay in modern Nusaybin. However, by the mid-6th cent. it was endowed with a local village all the proceeds of which went to it, and baths were built both for the brothers and as a means of revenue. The rules suggest that the School was within the town, but that a social separation between members and local citizens was maintained. Aside from the teaching staff, the School also had a <i>rabbaytā</i>, or steward, who was responsible for both discipline and the day-to-day running of the institution.</p>
<p>The School may have served as a model to other E.-Syr. schools, varieties of which spread in the Sasanian Empire through the 6th cent. This, along with theological controversy surrounding <ref type="cr">Ḥenana</ref> of <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref>, its head at the turn of the 7th cent., may explain its eventual decline.</p>

<p>German Semitist. Nöldeke was born in Harburg (near Hamburg) on 2 March 1836 and died in Karlsruhe on 25 Dec. 1930. In 1853, he began the study of classical and Near Eastern languages in Göttingen, where he earned his doctoral degree in 1856. Starting in 1856, he undertook trips to Leipzig, Vienna, Leiden, Gotha, and Berlin, mainly to study Arabic and Turkish mss. Between 1858 and 1860, he was an assistant at the Königliche Bibliothek (Royal Library) in Berlin, and from 1860 at the University Library in Göttingen. In 1861, he became a <i>Privatdozent</i> (university lecturer) for Semitic languages at Göttingen. In 1864 followed his appointment as professor of Near Eastern languages at the University of Kiel, and in 1872 at the newly founded German University of Strasbourg in the Alsace. After his retirement, in 1906, he first stayed in Strasbourg, until 1920, and then moved to Karlsruhe.</p>
<p>In his earliest writings, Nöldeke dealt with the Qurʾān. His main publication in this field <i>Geschichte des Qorans</i> (History of the Qurʾān) first appeared in 1860 and provided a new, solid foundation for research on the Qurʾān. Other projects concerned Arabic poetry and fable research. In 1896, a study on the classical Arabic language appeared.</p>
<p>During his time in Kiel, where he also taught Old Testament and Sanskrit, and where the University Library had rich Syriac holdings, his interests in Aramaic became more prominent. It is in this period that he laid the foundations for his scholarly work on Syriac, Neo-Syriac, and Mandaic. As early as 1868, he published his <i>Grammatik der neusyrischen Sprache am Urmia-See und in Kurdistan</i> (Grammar of the Neo-Syriac language at Lake Urmia and in Kurdistan), which was based on the publications of the American missionaries. His <i>Mandäische Grammatik</i> (Mandaic Grammar) followed in 1875. On the basis of his extensive readings in Syriac literature, he wrote his Syriac Grammar, the first edition of which appeared in 1880 and the second expanded edition in 1898. Without going into too much linguistic detail, its focus is on syntax, amply documented with textual references. As such it remains a unique tool up to the present day. An English translation appeared in 1904. Even though the content of Syriac literature — to which he devoted a short survey essay in 1906 — did not strongly appeal to him, he devoted studies to individual works such as the <ref type="cr">Alexander</ref>Romance, <ref type="cr">Julian Romance</ref>, the <ref type="cr">Aḥiqar</ref>Story, and <ref type="cr">Kalila and Dimna</ref>. In addition, his contributions to Syriac studies consisted of numerous essays and reviews.</p>
<p>A further important field of Nöldeke’s research was Iranian history and literature. In 1879, he published a translation from the Arabic Chronicle of al-Ṭabarī, entitled <i>Geschichte der Perser und Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden</i> (History of the Persians and Arabs in the time of the Sasanians). His relevant contributions to the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> were reworked in German and published in 1887 as <i>Aufsätze zur persischen Geschichte</i> 
(Essays on Persian history). Additional fields of Nöldeke’s research were comparative Semitic linguistics and Old Testament.</p>
<p>Characteristic for Nöldeke are his sober assessment and his common sense. He saw himself as a ‘rationalist’, limiting himself to what could be ascertained and avoiding unprovable hypotheses or speculations. Eastern mysticism remained utterly foreign to him.</p>
<p>Nöldeke was among the most significant scholars of Near Eastern studies of his day even though due to poor health he never was able to visit the Middle East. Through him, Strasbourg became a center of Near Eastern studies in Germany. He had many students, including from abroad; he maintained contacts with many scholars and enjoyed international esteem. For his seventieth birthday, a Festschrift was published, of more than 1200 pages, to which 85 colleagues contributed from all over the world (with photograph). A second Festschrift followed in 1916 for his eightieth birthday.</p>

Ca. 815 Nonos’s relative Abū Rāʾiṭa, the Miaphysite Bp. of <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref>, sent Nonos to the court of the Armenian prince Ashot Msaker to debate against the Melkite Abū Qurra. Later chronicles often attribute Armenia’s continuing support of the Miaphysite cause to Nonos’s success in this encounter. Nonos next appears in 827 or 828 at the Council of <ref type="cr">Reshʿayna</ref> where his testimony resulted in the council deposing Philoxenos bp. of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>. It is unclear what the charges against Philoxenos were; a letter from the Patr. <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> simply refers to ‘abominations.’ From both external sources and from Nonos’s own writings we learn that, under the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil, Nonos was imprisoned from ca. 856 until 861. Also with him were Toma, the E.-Syr. Metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>, and Toma’s brother Theodosios, who had recently become Cath. Nonos wrote his four surviving Syriac works while in prison. After al-Mutawakkil’s death, Nonos was released. The final recorded incident in Nonos’s life is his attendance at the Armenian council of Shirakawan in 862.</p>
<p>Five texts by Nonos remain extant. The longest is his Commentary on John, preserved in Armenian. In 1920 Crakhean published an edition of this text based on two mss. now found in Venice. According to the incipit, Nonos originally composed his commentary in Arabic. The Syriac ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,594 which <ref type="cr">Mushe of Nisibis</ref> obtained for the monastery of <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in 932 provides the sole witness to Nonos’s Syriac writings. This manuscript preserves: 
1. an apologetic treatise on the trinity and the incarnation; 
2. a four-discourse work written against the metropolitan Toma; 3. Nonos’s response to an anonymous inquiry regarding trinitarian and incarnational theology; and 4. a letter responding to christological questions sent to Nonos by a monk named Yuḥanon. In 1948 Van Roey published an edition and Latin translation of the first of these works in which Nonos provides brief answers to the theological challenges raised most frequently by contemporary Muslims. Nonos’s other Syriac works remain unedited.</p>

<p>Educator and modern reformer. He was born Ibrahīm Kahlajī (later Syriacized his name to Abrohom Nuro) in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, then migrated to <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> with the massive Edessan exodus of 1924. In 1946 he joined the University of St. Joseph, Lebanon, and studied law, only to withdraw in the final year due to illness. From the 1950s he began to work in the field of Syriac, especially teaching the language, and was the first to introduce <ref type="cr">Kthobonoyo Syriac</ref> as the spoken language at home (first with his sisters, and much later in life with his wife). He lived in <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref> from 1964 until 1982 where he 
taught Syriac at <ref type="cr">Taw Mim Simkath</ref> School, 1970–71 (and earlier in the 1940s), Kaslik (1967–68). After 1943 he organized more than 45 Syriac-language evening courses in Aleppo, Beirut, Qamishli, and the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref>. He developed an audio-visual pedagogical method called <i>Suloqo</i>, later published in book form. His reform proposals include printing Syriac in separate letters (<i>al-Is</i><i>ṭ</i><i>rangiliyya al-Mustaqilla</i> with Karim Shahan [Beirut, 1967]), a partial vocalization system for schools (see <i>Suloko</i>[Holland, 1989]), and hundreds of neologisms for modern technical terms, many of which are now standard in Kthobonoyo Syriac (see <i>Tawldotho</i> 1997, and the appendix to Manna’s dictionary [2nd ed. 1975]). In 1967, he published <i>My Tour</i>, a report on the state of the Syr. Orth. Church, but also rich with pictures of Syriac scholars from <ref type="cr">Joseph Assemani</ref>(1687–1768) to <ref type="cr">Nöldeke</ref> (1836–1930). His private library is rich with books published in the Middle East during the 1800s and 1900s, most of which were acquired by G. Kiraz and the Beth Mardutho Library.

</LemmaTitle><p>The <ref type="cr">Syriac language</ref> is best known from the large corpus of Christian literature that began to be produced by the 2nd-cent. and continues to be composed until the present day. Syriac is, however, also attested in a much smaller corpus of non-Christian documentary texts that date from the 1st to the 3rd cent. These texts are traditionally termed ‘Old Syriac’. The largest group of Old Syriac texts are <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref>, which number over 100 (ed. Drijvers and Healey). In addition to the Old Syriac inscriptions, there are also the Old Syriac documents, which include three Syriac parchments as well as several Syriac texts found on (primarily) Greek documents from the Middle Euphrates region.</p>
<p>The first of the Old Syriac parchments was discovered in 1933 during excavations of <ref type="cr">Dura-Europos</ref>, an important military outpost for the Parthian Empire and then the Roman Empire on the Euphrates. This document, which is now known as P. Dura 28, is a bill of sale for a female slave dated 9 May 243 (the most accessible version of the text is in Drijvers and ­Healey, 232–6 [s.v. P1]; but see also Bellinger and Welles; Goldstein; Healey 2009, 264–75 [with plate 9]; Torrey; Welles, Fink, and Gilliam, 142–9 [with pl. LXIX, LXXI]; plates are also found in Moller, 185–6). In addition to this Syriac parchment, more than 150 other documents were found at Dura-Europos, most of which are in Greek or Latin though there are also a few in Iranian or Aramaic (ed. Welles, Fink, and Gilliam). For more than fifty years, P. Dura 28 was without parallel, but in 1988 two similar Old Syriac parchments, now known as ­P.  Euphrates 19 and 20, came to light. Though not found in controlled excavations, it is likely that both of these documents originate from Appadana (Nea­polis), just north of Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. 
P. Euphrates 19 is a transfer of debt dated 28 Dec. 240 (the most accessible version of the text is in Drijvers and Healey, 237–42 [s.v. P2], but see also Teixidor 1989, 220; 1990, 144–54 [includes two plates]; Brock; Aggoula; Healey 2008; 2009, 252–64 [with plate 8]). P. Euphrates  20 is a property lease dated 1 Sept. 242 (the most accessible version of the text is in Drijvers and Healey, 243–8 [s.v. P3]; see also Teixidor 1989; 1990, 154–57; 1991–1992 [includes two plates]; Brock; Aggoula). These two Syriac parchments belong to a cache of texts that also includes 
19 Greek papyri and parchments (ed. Feissel and Gascou [and Teixidor]). On several of these Greek texts, there is additional writing in Syriac. P. Euphrates 6 (with its duplicate P. Euphrates 7), for instance, contains a bill of sale for a slave in Greek, which is followed by seven lines of Syriac summarizing the sale as well as a list of witnesses and guarantors (verso), both in Syriac. In addition, a Syriac subscription occurs on two of the Greek papyri, viz. P. Euphrates 3 and its duplicate P. Euphrates 4. This subscription is the earliest witness to the use of Syriac on papyrus (see <ref type="cr">Papyri, Syriac</ref>).</p>
<p>Since their discovery, the Old Syriac documents have proven important on a number of fronts. In both their content and form they have added to the growing body of data for the Aramaic legal tradition. The three Old Syriac parchments are of the <i>Doppelurkunde-</i>type, in which the main text is presented on the lower portion of the parchment and an abbreviated summary occurs on the top. This top section would have originally been rolled up and sealed in order to prevent tampering. This practice is well attested both in Greek and Aramaic papyrology, and it may have antecedents in the cuneiform tradition where tablets were enclosed in clay envelopes. The legal terminology in the Old Syriac parchments also points to continuity with other Aramaic legal texts, such as the Elephantine papyri, the Samaria Papyri, the Nabataean papyri, and the Jewish legal texts from the Judaean desert and the ‘Cave of Letters’ in Naḥal Ḥever (see Healey 2005). In P. Dura 28, for instance, it is stated: ‘From today until forever, you, Tiro, the buyer, and your heirs will have authority (<i>šlyṭ</i>) over this female slave whom I have sold to you, to possess or to sell or to do with her whatever you wish (<i>kl d-tṣb</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ)’ (ln. 11–12). This type of statement — commonly called a <i>Kyrieia</i>-clause  — is found throughout the Aramaic legal tradition, as well as in Greek papyri.</p>
<p>The dating formulae in the Old Syriac documents has provided valuable information for the chronology of the last kings of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (see <ref type="cr">Abgarids</ref>). P. Dura 28 shows that the Abgarid dynasty must have come to an end in 212/213 when the city became a Roman <i>colonia</i>. On the basis of P. Euphrates 19, which states that 28 Dec. 240 is the 2nd year of king Abgar, it can be established that the dynasty was restored in 239 (or late 238) under Abgar X, son of Maʿnu. Finally, it seems that Edessa must have reverted to a <i>colonia</i>by 242 on the basis of P. Euphrates 20, which gives 1 Sept. 242 as year 30 of the <i>colonia</i>.</p>
<p>The Old Syriac documents are also an important witness to an early stage of the Syriac language. The <ref type="cr">script</ref> of the Old Syriac documents is not the monumental Esṭrangela that is found in most of the Old Syriac inscriptions and the oldest Syriac literary mss., but rather it is of a more cursive type (especially in P. Euphrates 20) that also occurs in some mosaic inscriptions. These documents, thus, corroborate the existence of a cursive script, which was used alongside Esṭrangela already in the earliest period of Syriac and which would later develop into Serṭo (see Healey 2000). In orthography, the Old Syriac documents have features in common with the Old Syriac inscriptions, but different from Classical Syriac, e.g. the defective writing of historical short *<i>u</i> (e.g. <i>ḥ</i><i>šbn</i> ‘reckoning’) versus the plene writing with a <i>mater lectionis</i> in Classical Syriac (e.g. <i>ḥwšbn</i>) and the representation of the etymological lateral *<i>ɬ</i> (= traditional <i>ś</i>) with <i>š</i> (e.g. <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>šryn</i> ‘twenty’) versus <i>s</i> in Classical Syriac (e.g. <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>sryn</i>). In one important diagnostic feature, however, the Old Syriac documents differ from most of the Old Syriac inscriptions in agreement with Classical Syriac: the prefix marker of the 3rd-person masculine prefix-conjugation is <i>y</i> in most of the Old Syriac inscriptions, but <i>n</i> in both the Old Syriac documents and Classical Syriac. This shows that there was already linguistic variation in Old Syriac (see recently Healey 2008). Finally, the Old Syriac documents provide evidence for Syriac-Greek language contact already in the middle of the 3rd cent. as there are a relatively large number of Greek lexical borrowings (20 types that occur more than 50 times) in the documents, several of which show a significant degree of incorporation into the Syriac language, e.g. <cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>sṭrṭgwt</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ ‘strategos-ship’ (\< Greek <i>stratēgós</i>) and <cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>rkwnwt</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ ‘archon-ship’ (\< Greek <i>árchōn</i>).</p>

<p>Modern term for the NT versions prior to the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> (excluding the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref>), which includes 1. the ‘Curetonian’ and Sinaitic Gospel mss.; 2. quotations mainly in the writings of <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, and in the <ref type="cr">Book of Steps</ref>; and 3. the Old Syriac heritage of early Peshitta mss. Frequently the term is restricted to the two mentioned Gospel mss. only. The Old Syriac Version is the earliest representative of the four-Gospel NT in the Syriac speaking area East of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. As <i>ewangeliyon da-mparrše</i> (‘Gospel of the separate ones [i.e., books]’) it circulated beside the Diatessaron (<i>ewangeliyon da-mḥallṭe</i>, ‘Gospel of the mixed ones [i.e., books]’) and was replaced by the Peshitta in the course of the 5th/6th cent.</p>
<p>The ‘Codex Curetonianus’ (‘C’; Wright, <i>Catalogue …</i><i>British Museum</i>, vol. 1, no. CXIX, ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,451) is named after <ref type="cr">W. Cureton</ref>, who identified the version and prepared the first edition in 1858. It is based on the 87 parchment folios which came to the British Museum in 1842–47 from <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in the Nitrian Desert (Egypt). The definitive edition, prepared by 
F. C. Burkitt (1904) includes three further leaves preserved at Berlin (Orient. Quart. 528, first ed. by E.  Roediger 1872) and gives the deviations of the Sinaitic ms. in the footnotes. One additional folio (still at Dayr al-Suryān) was published by D. McConaughy in 1987. The unusual sequence of the Gospels in this 5th-cent. codex is Mt, Mk, Jn, Lk. The text of the present-day ms. is Mt 1:1–8:22; 10:32–23:25; Mk 16:17–20 (Mk almost completely lost); Jn 1:1–42; 3:5–8:19; 14:10–2, 15–9, 21–4, 26–9; Lk 2:48–3:16; 7:33–15:21; 17:24–24:44. The three folios in Berlin: Jn 7:37–8:19; Lk 15:22–16:12; 17:1–23; the single folio published by D. McConaughy: Lk 16:13–17:1.</p>
<p>The ‘Sinaitic ms.’ (‘S’; ms. Sin. Syr. 30; Hatch, <i>Album</i>, plate XLVI) Agnes Smith Lewis and her twin sister Margaret D. Gibson discovered in 1892 during a visit at <ref type="cr">St. Catherine Monastery</ref> at Mount Sinai. This 4th/5th-cent. codex is a palimpsest, the original Gospel text was removed in the 8th cent. to reuse the parchment for the history of female saints. R. L. Bensly, J. R. Harris, and 
F. C. Burkitt assisted A. S. Lewis in the difficult decipherment of the under-writing, which required five additional journeys to St. Catharine and the application of a reagent. In 1894 the team of scholars published the palimpsest; some re-examined folios with improved readings followed in 1896. The standard edition of the Sinaitic ms. with further improvements and much additional material was published by A. S. Lewis in 1910, now with the deviations of Codex Curetonianus in the footnotes. The surviving 142 leaves preserve the text of Mt 1:1–6:10; 8:3–12:4, 6–25, 30–16:15; 17:11–20:24; 21:20–25:15, 17–20, 25–26, 32–28:7; Mk 1:12–44; 2:21–4:17, 41–5:26; 6:5–16:8; Lk 1:1–16, 38–5:28; 6:12–24:52; Jn 1:25–47; 2:16–4:37; 5:6–25, 46–18:31; 19:40–21:25. Some passages in Mt are partially illegible. Ultra-violet photography applied to the codex by K. and B. Aland in 1982 failed to decipher additional portions of the text.</p>
<p>The relation between C and S is not definitely settled. On the one hand, both mss. are too different to be copies of the same text; on the other, their agreements exclude the possibility of two different translations of the Greek. They are rather independent traditions of the same version and reflect a revisional development. This would imply a longer period of revision and allow for the possibility of originally more than two independent traditions side by side.</p>
<p>The date and origin of the Old Syriac Version are disputed too. The introduction of the Four-Gospel canon is certainly due to Western influence and corresponds with the advance of ‘orthodox’ Graeco-Roman theology and organization to Syria and Mesopotamia. This makes Antioch and Northern Palestine more probable as the place of origin than <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. The Old Syriac Version came into being in an area dominated by the Diatessaron, since ca. 170, which was replaced by the Four-Gospel canon only in the 5th cent. The first attempts to produce Separate Gospels may have started in the 3rd cent., and the archetype of C and S may tentatively be traced to these early efforts; however, the introduction of the Four-Gospel canon as the approved NT in the area East of Antioch cannot be dated earlier than the 4th/5th cent. The Four-Gospel canon was definitely settled in the time of <ref type="cr">Rabbula</ref> by a thorough revision of the Old Syriac textual traditions, which resulted in the Peshitta.</p>
<p>Quotations of the Old Syriac type are in the writings of Aphrahaṭ, Ephrem, in the ‘Book of Steps’, and in a few additional documents; they are collected by Burkitt, Leloir, and Kerschensteiner. Here the qualification ‘Old Syriac’ refers to the pre-Peshitta origin of the texts. In the Gospels comparison with C, S, and the Peshitta is possible; outside of the Gospels, where there is no direct attestation in Old Syriac mss., solely the Peshitta can be compared. It is not certain whether these quotations reflect an established Old Syriac Version or individual attempts of translation. In the Gospels the Diatessaron is quoted side by side with the Separate Gospels (labelled as ‘the Greek’ by Ephrem); this may reflect the dominance of the Diatessaron and the circulation of Old Syriac textual traditions in the 4th cent. According to Ephrem’s commentary on the Pauline epistles (preserved in Armenian), an additional (3rd) epistle to the Corinthians was part of the Old Syriac NT canon. The Catholic Epistles probably were not included in the canon; although 1 Pet and 1 Jn are known, they are never qualified as ‘Scripture.’</p>
<p>The Old Syriac heritage of early Peshitta mss. is a minor source of the Old Syriac Version and still awaiting exploitation. This heritage derives from the Old Syriac prehistory of the Peshitta and was set out in some detail by A.  Allgeier (1932) and A. Juckel (2003). M. Black launched the hypothesis of a ‘Pre-Peshitta’ (1952), produced by Rabbula and closer to the Old Syriac than the definitive Peshitta. From this Pre-Peshitta remaining Old Syriac elements were successively (though insufficiently) eliminated by further revision. Whatever the role of Rabbula in this context may be, the agreement of the definitively revised Peshitta with the Old Syriac is striking. Majority readings as well as minority readings (represented by single or several mss. only) of the definitive Peshitta participate in this agreement. Access to this source of the Old Syriac Version is given by the collation of Peshitta mss. presented in the Gospel volume prepared by Ph. E.  Pusey / G. H. Gwilliam (1901). Among these mss. Codex Phillipps 1388 (5th/6th cent.) is the most prominent witness. Further collations are necessary to exploit this source of the Old Syriac Version sufficiently in order to reconstruct the pre-Peshitta as far as possible.</p>

The late <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>onyāthā</i> are liturgical hymns characterized by a tripartite structure: prologues and epilogues contain lines of various length, whereas the main text is structured in verses of a fixed number of isosyllabic lines.

<LemmaTitle>Palimpsests
</LemmaTitle><p>Palimpsest is the term used for a parchment ms. that has been written on twice (or rarely, more times), where the original script has been erased. A very high proportion of the older surviving texts in <ref type="cr">Christian Palestinian Aramaic</ref> (CPA) are under texts in palimpsests. Palimpsests where Syriac is the upper text mostly date between 9th and 12th cent.; the under text may be in a variety of different languages, Greek, Latin, Armenian, Coptic, CPA, as well as an earlier Syriac text. Two particularly notable examples are ms. Sinai Syr. 30 (upper text, probably dated 779: Lives of holy women; lower: <ref type="cr">Old Syriac</ref> Gospels, <ref type="cr">Acts of Thomas</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> Graecus); and ms. Vatican Syr. 623 (upper, 886: 40 Martyrs of Sinai, etc.; lower: Syriac translation of <ref type="cr">Galen</ref> and of <ref type="cr">Menander</ref>’s Dyskolos, as well as texts in Arabic, Armenian, CPA, and Greek). A number of Syriac mss. in the British Library have remarkable undertexts, e.g. Add. 14,512 (the oldest dated biblical ms. in any language; Isaiah, 459/60); Add. 14,574 and 14,623 (Ephrem, Prose Refutations); Add. 17,210–11, copied in the Monastery of Shemʿun, Qartmin ca. 800 (Homer, Euclid).</p>
<p>Syriac, and especially CPA, may also be the under text where the upper text is in other languages, Greek, Arabic, Georgian, or Hebrew. Very occasionally manuscripts are doubly palimpsest (e.g. ms. Sinai Arabic 514).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Papa bar ʿAggai</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. between 327 and 335) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>. Elected around the middle of the 3rd cent., Papa’s tenure is said to have lasted until a few years after the Council of Nicea (325). <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> reports that either Papa himself or his disciple and later successor <ref type="cr">Shemʿon bar Ṣabbaʿe</ref> attended the Council of Nicea, but there is no corroboration for this claim. Widely discussed in many sources, both Syriac and Arabic, is an event that took place most likely around 325. All sources agree that there was a conflict between Papa and some other Syriac bishops in the Persian Empire. It may have had to do with Papa’s efforts to establish his primacy, or with the way in which he exerted his power as the bp. of the empire’s leading city. The main spokesman of Papa’s opponents was Miles, bp. of Susa (martyred in 345). The Acts of Miles speak about the incident in terms very unfavorable to Papa; the report by bp. Agapetos of <ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>, which is included in the Synod of <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref> (424), takes Papa’s side and is negative about Miles; Bar ʿEbroyo’s summary report is neutral and dispassionate. Upset about the accusations that Miles brought forth against him at the synod, Papa is said to have struck the Gospel book in front of him, either in an act of despair or in contempt and defiance. As a result his hand was paralyzed. The sources disagree about whether Papa subsequently was deposed and about how long he lived after the incident. Agapetos used the incident around Papa in his defense of Cath. Dadishoʿ and described the conflict as resulting from the rebellion by Miles and others (similar, in his view, to the rebellion in Dadishoʿ’s day). Agapetos mentioned, and even quoted from, letters from the West, which were sent in Papa’s support and led to his rehabilit<ab type="infobox"/>ation. Bar ʿEbroyo also knew of these letters, but doubted their authenticity and pointed to Cath. <ref type="cr">Yawsep</ref> as their possible author. These letters, expressing support for Papa, are preserved among a collection of 8 letters (some written by Papa and others addressed to him), transmitted in the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref> and translated into German by Braun. They are attributed to <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, and ‘the Western Fathers’. In Demonstration XIV, traditionally attributed to <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, the author complains about the abusive leadership in the Church and about the crowned head who was rejected by his own people and found support with foreign leaders. Some scholars (most recently Fiey) have seen this as a description of Papa’s leadership. If indeed Papa were the subject of this diatribe, the traditional date for this Demonstration (343/4) would have to be rejected, and the text would have to be separated from the original list of Aphrahaṭ’s twenty-two Demonstrations. The author’s view on Papa would be closer to that expressed in the Acts of Miles than to the one endorsed by Agapetos in the Synod of 424.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Papyri, Syriac</LemmaTitle>
<p>Throughout its long history (more than two millennia), the <ref type="cr">Syriac language</ref>has been written on a variety of different mediums. The two most common are parchment for the early period and paper for the later period (see <ref type="cr">Manuscripts</ref>). Syriac has, however, also been set in tile mosaic, inked onto stoneware, and incised into stone, wood, and metal. In addition, Syriac has occasionally been written on papyrus.</p>
<p>The earliest surviving example of Syriac written on papyrus is associated with the three 3rd-cent. Syriac parchments (see <ref type="cr">Old Syriac documents</ref>). While all three of these documents are parchments, the two from the Middle Euphrates region were found with a cache of Greek texts, some of which are papyri. On two of these papyri (viz. P. Euphrates 3 and 4), the following writing in Syriac occurs after the Greek text of the petition: <cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>wrls ʿbšwṭ</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i> ktbt</i>‘I, PN, sign’ (ed. Feissel and Gascou, 94–107).</p>
<p>The only Syriac documentary text written on papyrus that has yet been edited is a partially-preserved letter possibly from the 7th cent. (P. Berol. Inv. 8285; ed. Brashear 96–100 with pl. XIII; important corrections in Brock 1999). Though the context of the text is not entirely clear due to its state of preservation, the writer of the letter seems to be a person in authority who is addressing an inferior. The text is written in a cursive <ref type="cr">script</ref> similar to Serṭo.</p>
<p>In addition to documentary texts, literary texts were also written in Syriac on papyrus. In 1985, 
J.-M. Sauget published a single folio of a papyrus fragment conserved in Florence (PSI Inv. 3020). This fragment, which he dated to the 9th cent., contains a section of the <ref type="cr">Didascalia Apostolorum</ref>. In 1995, S. P. Brock identified an additional papyrus folio of the same text in the Schøyen collection (no. 1644/1; ed. Brock 1995, 9–14). At one time, these two folios, which follow one another sequentially, must have belonged to a single papyrus ms. In addition to the Didascalia Apostolorum, the Schøyen fragment also contains a text by a certain Mar Yoʾanis, who may possibly be <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref>.</p>
<p>An additional fragmentary Syriac papyrus is found among the holdings of the Schøyen collection (no. 1644/2; ed. Brock 1995, 18–22). This fragment, which again may date from the 9th cent., contains the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> version of Acts 8:40–9:14 (recto) and Acts 9:16–9:27 (verso).</p>
<p>Among the many textual finds from Kellis in the Dakhla Oasis are several Manichaean Syriac papyri, now labeled P. KellisSyr. 1, which almost certainly consists of three distinct papyri (ed. in Gardner, vol. 1, 127–8 with pl. 19), and P. KellisSyr. 2 (ed. in Gardner, vol. 2, 136–137 with pl. 38). According to the editors, these papyri are probably literary, but their current fragmentary state mitigates any further description or identification. In addition to these monolingual Syriac papyri, a personal name is written in Syriac on the verso of a Greek letter on papyrus from Kellis (P. KellisGr. 67; see Gardner 2007). Along with the Syriac-Coptic glossaries on wood boards, these Syriac papyri — and the Syriac address on a Greek papyrus — point to the use of Syriac in the Manichaean community at Kellis.</p>
<p>In addition to these texts, which have been edited, a number of other Syriac papyri are known to exist. In 1975, ca. 50 Syriac papyrus fragments were found at the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref>(see Digbassanis). Most of the papyri are said to date from the 5th–7th cent., and at least two contain sections of the OT. In 1998, a number of Syriac papyrus fragments were found at <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>in Egypt, a monastery which is well-known for having provided a large number of early Syriac mss. According to Bigoul el-Souriany and Van Rompay, the Dayr al-Suryān papyrus fragments most likely come from a codex that contained an as of yet unidentified ascetical text. Based on paleography, a 9th cent. date has been tentatively suggested, though a (slightly) earlier date cannot be ruled out. Alongside these two larger caches, a few Syriac papyri are also said to be found in collections in Oxford (Bodleian Library), Vienna, Heidelberg, and Cheltenham (for full references, see Brashear, 91 n. 24).</p>
<p>While their number pales in comparison to the thousands of Syriac texts on parchment and paper, the Syriac papyri add yet a further dimension to Syriac language and writing. The Syriac papyri also speak directly to Syriac’s continuity with the earlier <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> heritage. Aramaic papyri survive from as early as the mid-6th cent. BC. The Syriac papyri then represent the last stage of a long tradition of writing Aramaic on papyrus.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</Author><LemmaTitle>Pawlos of Beth Ukome</head><ab type="infobox"/> (d. 581) [Syr. Orth.]<CharStyle:Lemma info 1 Char>
<p>Patr. Pawlos’s name (‘of the house of the black ones’) was rendered in Greek as ‘of the black (ones)’ (<i>Melanos</i>, sing., or <i>Melanōn</i>, plur.). He was elected patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> in a period when the Miaphysites of Syria and Egypt were working closely together in their resistance to the Chalcedonian doctrine of the Imperial Church. After the death of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> (d. 538), <ref type="cr">Theodosius of Alexandria</ref> assumed the leadership of the Miaphysites, even while living as an exile in Constantinople. It was only in the late 550s that the Syr. Miaphysites proceeded with the election of their own leader, first Sergius, who had a short tenure (ca. 557–60), and then, a few years later, Pawlos (who was elected in 564, at the instigation of Patr. Theodosius). Pawlos, who had worked with Theodosius, was a native of Alexandria; prior to his election he may have spent some time in Syria as a monk (Honigmann, 196). Once elected he may have had the ambition of exerting leadership over both the Syrian and Egyptian Churches, as the follower of Theodosius (d. 566), but he found little support. In 571, in a time when the Miaphysites were oppressed by the Chalcedonians, Pawlos is said to have temporarily accepted communion with the Chalcedonians, an act which he later regretted and for which he had to accept a three-year penitence in order to be fully rehabilitated. In 575 he played a role in the election and formal recognition of a Syrian monk, Theodorus (who had lived for several years in Scetis) as patr. of Alexandria. The Alexandrians, however, rejected Theodorus, and a different candidate was elected to the see of Alexandria, Peter (IV, 575–77). For what he saw as Pawlos’s unlawful intervention in the election process, Peter issued the deposal of Pawlos, and a schism between the two patriarchates broke out. That this did not have nationalist undertones is clear from the fact that Peter had a Syrian secretary in Damian (who was from <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, the city he visited in the fall of 579), who only two years later became Peter’s successor in Alexandria. Within the Syrian Miaphysite community, the schism created bitter opposition between Pawlos’s staunch supporters and those who, for a variety of reasons, withdrew their support from Pawlos. Among the latter was <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref>. The Syrian Miaphysite community thus became divided between ‘Paulists’ (or Paulianists, Greek <i>Paulianistai</i>, Syriac <i>Beth Pawlo</i>) and ‘Jacobites’. Pawlos himself withdrew to Constantinople, where he spent the last years of his life in relative isolation. When following the death of Pawlos (581), <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref> was elected the new patr. of Antioch, the peace between the two patriarchates lasted for only a few years. For, starting in the mid-580s, Peter of Kallinikos and Damian became involved in a new conflict, in which this time the theological problem of ‘Tritheism’ was central and led to another schism.

<p>Among Pawlos’s writings, some letters and official statements have been preserved: his synodical letter to Theodosius (Syr. in CSCO 17, 98–114; LT in CSCO 103, 68–79); a letter to Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo and to Theodorus (Syr. in CSCO 17, 177–9; LT in CSCO 103, 123–5); Pawlos’s synodical letter to Patr. Theodorus (Syr. in CSCO 17, 308–34; LT in CSCO 103, 215–33); as well as some additional fragments (see <i>CPG</i> and Suppl.). A short document refuting the positions of the Paulists and defending the judgments and actions of Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo has recently been published by Lontie. Information on Pawlos and on the situation of the Syr. Orth. in the 2nd half of the 6th cent. is found in the main W.-Syr. historiographical works (among which the Ecclesiastical History of the contemporary witness <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> stands out). Many official and semi-official documents of the Syr. Orth Church in the 6th cent. are preserved in a collection (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,602, late 6th or early 7th cent.) that its editor, J.-B. Chabot named ‘Documenta ad origines Monophysitarum illustrandas’.</p>

[Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Bp. of Kallinikos; translator of works of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref>. Pawlos must have become bp. no later than Aug. 509, at which time he is mentioned as bp. in an inscription on a mosaic floor in Tall Biʿa, near Kallinikos (Krebernik). His tenure as bp. came to an end in 519, when he was among the 52 Miaphysite bps. who were expelled from their see following the implementation of a new Chalcedonian policy by Emperor Justin I.</p>
<p>Pawlos is explicitly mentioned as the translator of Severus’s writings against <ref type="cr">Julian Halicarnassus</ref> in a note at the end of ms. Vat. Syr. 140 (6th cent.), the main witness for these writings. That this ms. might be Pawlos’s autograph, as Baumstark speculated, is unlikely (Draguet, 13, note 6; and Hespel, in CSCO 295, iii); most scholars nowadays take the date of 528, provided in the note (which is in a different hand from that of the rest of the ms.), for the date of the completion of the original translation, rather than that of the ms. With Pawlos’s authorship of the Syriac version of the anti-Julianist dossier firmly established, several scholars have suggested that Pawlos may have translated other works by Severus as well. While King has made a strong case for attributing the Syriac translation of Severus’s Philalethes to Pawlos (King 2007 and 2008, 176–7), there is little evidence for seeing Pawlos as the translator of other works, such as the Cathedral Homilies (the 6th-cent. translation of which was later revised by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>).</p>
<p>Even if we are unable to determine Pawlos’s contribution with precision, he certainly belonged to the small circle of Miaphysite intellectuals who in the crucial period of the first quarter of the 6th cent. embarked on a major translation project, for which they applied standards that were more rigorous than those prevalent in the earlier period, without becoming ‘so obsessively calque-esque’ (King 2008, 385) as those that characterized the 7th-cent. translations (in general, see <ref type="cr">Greek, Syriac translations from)</ref>.</p>

<p>Theologian, biblical commentator, and bp. of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, for which position he was selected in 544 by Cath. Mar <ref type="cr">Aba</ref>, his former teacher. As metropolitan bp. of Nisibis, Pawlos attended the Synod convened by Cath. <ref type="cr">Yawsep</ref> in 554 and signed the acts. He played an important role in the deposition of Yawsep, probably in 567, and, according to the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>, he had to cope with problems arising in the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>, involving the newly arrived teacher <ref type="cr">Ḥenana</ref>of<ref type="cr"> Adiabene</ref>. In the war between the Byzantine and Persian Empires, which broke out in 572, Pawlos is said to have supported Byzantine efforts to reconquer the city of Nisibis. When this failed, his death saved him from deposition and further humiliation.</p>
<p>Soon after 561, the Persian emperor Khusrau sent Pawlos, along with some other E.-Syr. theologians, to Constantinople. Of the official theological discussion, arranged by the emperor Justinian, Pawlos wrote a report that is preserved in a W.-Syr. ms. of Monothelete provenance. It was published and studied by Guillaumont, who argued that in this text the concept of the two hypostases (<i>qnome</i>) in Christ is mentioned for the first time. This concept was later generally accepted in E.-Syr. Christology.</p>
<p><ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ of Nisibis</ref>, in his ‘Catalogue’ (no. 65), presents Pawlos as the author of a biblical commentary. While this has not been preserved in direct transmission, a few fragments are incorporated into later E.-Syr. biblical commentaries.</p>

<p>Itinerant E.-Syr. scholar. Pawlos is primarily known through a mid-6th-cent. Latin manual of biblical interpretation, authored by Junillus Africanus. Junillus names as his main authority ‘a certain man called Pawlos, a Persian by origin, who was educated at the Syrian School in the city of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>’ (Preface). This Pawlos is said to have written a biblical manual in Greek, which Junillus claims to have used extensively. Scholars had noticed that Junillus’s handbook did indeed reflect many of the themes and approaches known from the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> and often traceable to <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. Junillus’s handbook was, therefore, seen as a more or less faithful translation of Pawlos’s work. The most recent analysis of the work, however, by Maas and Mathews, depicts Junillus as a more independent author (‘neither a passive translator of Pawlos the Persian nor a mouthpiece for the School of Nisibis’, 11), who relied only loosely on Pawlos’s work.</p>
<p>It may have been the same Pawlos who had a debate with a Manichaean in Constantinople in 527. The text of this is preserved in Greek, along with the refutation of a pamphlet written by (probably) the same Manichaean. Scholars in the past also tried to fuse Pawlos’s identity with that of <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Nisibis</ref> or <ref type="cr">Pawlos the Philosopher</ref>. For reasons of chronology and content it seems wiser to distinguish between the three persons named Pawlos, even though all three illustrate the vivid interest E.-Syr. intellectuals were showing in Greek culture during the age of Justinian.</p>

<ab type="infobox"/>Pawlos the Persian (mid-6th cent.) [Ch. of E.]
<p>Author of philosophical works. Little is known about Pawlos’s life. Two works, explicitly attributed to him are preserved in Syriac. The first, published and translated by Land and partly translated into French by Teixidor, is a treatise on logic. It is largely based on what the Syrians knew as <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>’s logical works, i.e., <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Eisagoge’, the ‘Categories’, ‘On interpretation’, and the first part of the ‘Prior Analytics’. The author dedicated the work to the Sasanian king Khusrau I Anushirwan (r. 531–78), who is known to have had a vivid interest in Greek philosophy. The second work, which remains unpublished, is a commentary on Aristotle’s ‘On Interpretation’. The Arab authors al‑Fārābī (d. 950) and Miskawayh (d. 1030) knew yet another work by Pawlos which, according to Gutas, must have been a general introduction into Aristotle’s philosophy, after the example of the Alexandrian Prolegomena.</p>
<p>It is uncertain in which language Pawlos wrote. 
A note that is preserved in two mss. of the commentary on ‘On interpretation’ states that Pawlos wrote the work in Persian and that <ref type="cr">Severos Sebokht</ref> (d. 666/7) translated it into Syriac. The treatise dedicated to Khusrau may also have been written originally in Persian. The question of whether Pawlos read the Aristotelian writings in Greek or in Syriac, and where he received his philosophical training cannot, in the present state of our knowledge, be answered. One further detail of Pawlos’s life, the veracity of which cannot be confirmed, is transmitted in <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s ‘Ecclesiastical Chronicle’ and in the ‘Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>’: after having been foiled in his attempt to become bp., Pawlos converted to Zoroastrianism, the official religion of the Sasanian Empire.</p>
<p>Clearly familiar with the tradition of Alexandrian neo-Platonism, Pawlos may have been an important transmitter of late-ancient philosophy to the Sasanian court, thus preparing the ground for the ambitious translation project of the Abbasid rulers in the Islamic period.</p>

<p>Bp. and translator. During the Persian invasion of Syria in the first decades of the 7th cent., Pawlos found refuge in Egypt. In the <ref type="cr">Enaton</ref> Monastery, near Alexandria, a team of scholars from Syria embarked on a major translation project. This included <ref type="cr">Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref>, whose name is connected with the <ref type="cr">Ḥarqlean</ref> version of the NT, and Pawlos of Tella who was responsible for the (probably first full) Syriac translation of the Septuagint (‘<ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref>’). According to the subscriptions of the Syro-Hexapla, the work was carried out between 613 and 617 (for these dates, see W. Baars, <i>New Syro-Hexaplaric Texts</i> [1968], 1).</p>
<p>The possibility cannot be ruled out that Pawlos came to Egypt much earlier, but the evidence is rather thin. According to Honigmann, Pawlos was in the company of Tumo of Ḥarqel ‘and other bishops’ who in 599 were expelled from their sees during the persecution of Dometianus, the nephew of Emperor Maurice. Even though the name of Pawlos is not mentioned in the sources (e.g. <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>X.25 = vol. 4, 391; FT 381), a bp. of Tella is mentioned among those who returned after the persecution (ibid., vol. 4, 390; FT 380). If this anonymous bp. indeed would be Pawlos, he must have traveled back to Egypt a few years later for the second time.</p>
<p>In addition to the Syro-Hexapla, Pawlos is mentioned as the translator of a baptismal order attributed to <ref type="cr">Severus</ref> <ref type="cr">of Antioch</ref>, which is preserved in mss. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,495 (f. 68v; Wright, <i>Catalogue</i>, vol. I, 228) and 14,499 (f. 65r; <i>Catalogue</i>, vol. I, 229b–30a). An original Syriac <i>sedro</i> composed by Pawlos exists in ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 75 (f. 134v; Zotenberg, <i>Catalogues</i>, 47a). The Syriac translation of the pericope John 7:50–8:12 (absent from the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>and Ḥarqlean), which is sometimes attributed to Pawlos of Tella, probably does not belong to him, but to <ref type="cr">Pawla of Edessa</ref>. Pawlos’s translation work, just as Tumo’s, is characterized by an attempt to imitate the morphology, syntax, and word order of the Greek original (in general, see <ref type="cr">Greek, Syriac translations from</ref>).</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The name ‘Peshitta’ is used both for the translation of the OT, made in the 2nd cent. on the basis of the Hebrew text, and for a revision of the <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Version</ref> of the NT, which became the standard version around 400.</p>
<label type="subsection">The Name ‘Peshitta’</label>
<p>It is only in the 9th cent. that we find the first attestation of the name ‘Peshitta’. <ref type="cr">Mushe bar Kipho</ref> (d. 903) uses the name in his Commentary on the Hexaemeron (unedited; GT in L. Schlimme [GOF I. Syriaca 14.1; 1977], 167–
173) and his Introduction to the Psalter (ed. with GT in G. Diettrich, <i>Eine jakobitische Einleitung</i> [Beihefte zur ZAW 5; 1901], 106–16). He explains that he knew of two translations in Syriac: the Peshitta, based on the Hebrew text, and <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Tella</ref>’s translation from the Greek text of the Septuagint (see <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref>). Earlier references, in Syriac as well as in Greek sources, simply refer to ‘the Syrian’.</p>
<p>The Syriac word <i>pšiṭt</i><i>ā</i> is the feminine passive participle of the verb <i>pšaṭ</i> ‘to stretch out, to extend’. It presupposes the word <i>mappaqtā</i> ‘translation’. The precise sense of this participle is no longer clear. In other contexts, it often means ‘simple’. As the use in <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> suggests, this is most probably also the sense when the word is applied to the Syriac Bible. Some modern scholars, however, have suggested other options. First, on the basis of the sense of the verb, the participle has been interpreted as ‘widespread’, in the sense of ‘in common use’, just like the Latin word <i>vulgata</i>. The Syriac Bible based on the Hebrew was indeed in common use, in contrast to the versions made on the basis of the Greek Septuagint. Second, the usual sense of the participle, ‘simple’, could be interpreted as ‘single’ rather than as ‘abstaining from eloquent language’. This also assumes that the name was intended to contrast the version with the Syro-Hexapla, the word <i>Hexapla</i> meaning ‘six-fold’.</p>
<label type="subsection">Origin and Dating of the OT Peshitta</label>
<p>Already in the 5th cent. one had to guess where the OT Peshitta came from. The Greek-speaking exegete <ref type="cr">Theo­dore of Mopsuestia</ref> (d. 428) says that the Syriac Bible was com­posed by some unknown man who often made mistakes and even made up stories. Syriac authors in the following centuries mentioned various theories: it would have been commissioned by Hiram, king of Tyre and an ally of David; alternatively it would have been translated by a priest called Asya, who was sent to Samaria by the king of Assyria (cf. 2 Kings 17:27–8), by the Apostles, by Mark the Evangelist, or in the time of Abgar.</p>
<p>Modern scholars would agree with Theodore of Mopsuestia that the name of the translator (or translators) is unknown. Still, one can try to find out where, when, and in which community the Peshitta was translated. Over the past two centuries, some scholars have defended Jewish authorship, others Christian, whereas the famous linguist Theodor Nöldeke came up with the compromise that Jewish Christians were behind the work.</p>
<p>The most thorough and innovative discussion of the origin of the Peshitta is that of the late Michael Weitzman. In his <i>Introduction</i> to this Syriac version, he first explains that the categories of ‘Judaism’ and ‘Christianity’ as they were used in the debate do not take account of the diversity within both religions which research of the last decades has revealed (see <ref type="cr">Judaism, Syriac contacts with</ref>). It would be better, he argues, first to establish the ‘theological profile’ of the translation. Only then can we compare the version with what we know of the Jewish and Christian communities of the time. Weitzman’s own position is that the Peshitta was translated in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> from 150 onwards by a non-rabbinic Jewish group that clearly identified themselves with Judaism, but neglected some elements of ritual in favour of a more personal belief, in which prayer played an important role. They emphasized faith and hope rather than observance. As they shared these values with Christians, they might have adopted Christianity. This would then explain how a Jewish translation came to be transmitted by the Eastern Churches, and why it was not received among rabbinic Jews.</p>
<p>The evidence for the presence of Jews in Edessa may lead to a modification (Romeny 2005). As far as we can tell on the basis of the funerary inscriptions found close to Edessa, it appears that Edessan Jews did use more or less the same dialect of Aramaic, but did not use the same script as the local pagans. They chose the square Jewish Aramaic script that was also used for Hebrew. On the other hand, Classical Syriac as we know it from the earliest Christian sources suggests that Edessan Christians adopted the Old Syriac dialect and script that were used by the pagans, rather than the Jewish script. This confronts us with the paradox of a translation that supposes a knowledge of Hebrew found only among very learned Jews but that was not written in the Jewish script. Was the Peshitta a gentile project, after all, or should we assume that, perhaps together with an update of the language, the translation was recast in Syriac script? The alternative is that the translators were Jewish Christians (in the sense of: Jews who had come to believe that Jesus Christ brought salvation) from the start.</p>
<p>It is certain that either some of the Jews of Edessa or one of its Christian groups felt the need for a version in the dialect of the town. What Weitzman calls the ‘theological profile’ of the translators is compatible with either possibility, as long as we do not think in terms of the ideal types of rabbinic Judaism and later Christianity. The use of the Syriac script, however, points solely in the direction of Christians. Whatever the case may be, it should be granted that the actual translation work was done by Jews, be they converted to Christianity before (Romeny) or after (Weitzman) the production of the Peshitta: we cannot assume that pagans who converted to Christianity commanded sufficient knowledge of Hebrew.</p>
<p>Weitzman connects the Peshitta with the city of Edessa. The Peshitta introduces references to Mabbug, <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> as additions to the text or substitutions for other names. These names suggest an origin in Osrhoene, the province around Edessa. The dialect and script of the Peshitta also accord well with that of the inscriptions found in this province.</p>
<p>Weitzman’s main argument for dating the OT Peshitta is formed by quotations of the Peshitta in other texts. On the basis of such quotations, a latest possible date can be established. If the Peshitta was indeed the basis for the OT quotations in the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref>, at least the books actually cited, that is, the Pentateuch, the Latter Prophets, and the Psalms, already existed and had attained some status by around 170. On the other hand, the fact that <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>, born in 154, quotes Gen. 9:6 in a form that stands closer to the Jewish Targum Onqelos could still indicate some reserve towards the Peshitta. This is a warning against adopting a much earlier date, and makes Weitzman propose the date of ca. 150. Chronicles, and perhaps also Ezra and Nehemiah, may have been translated about fifty years later.</p>
<label type="subsection">Origin and Dating of the NT Peshitta</label>
<p>The history of the translation of the Greek NT into Syriac begins with <ref type="cr">Tatian</ref>’s Diatessaron, a 2nd cent. Gospel harmony. The Old Syriac Version (3rd cent.) is the oldest translation of the four separate Gospels and the Peshitta (early 5th cent.) is a revision that brought the Old Syriac closer to the Greek. Burkitt (1904) attributed the Peshitta to <ref type="cr">Rabbula</ref>, the bp. of Edessa (411–35) who had vigorously suppressed the use of the Diatessaron in the Syriac Church. While Rabbula may have enforced the dissemination of the Peshitta version, the theory that he was responsible for its creation was convincingly challenged by Vööbus (1951) who illustrated how Rabbula’s own writings contained quotations from the Old Syriac Version and the Diatessaron.</p>
<p>The Peshitta did not abruptly replace the Old Syriac. M. Black (1953) argued for the existence of an early Peshitta text, which he labelled ‘Pre-Peshitta’, that was closer to the Old Syriac than the later, definitive text of the Peshitta. ‘Genetic variants’ in the Syriac textual tradition, namely, readings that lie between the Old Syriac and the Peshitta, trace the gradual process of revision toward the Greek (Juckel 2009). Still, the Diatessaronic readings that appear in the Peshitta convinced Joosten (1996) that the Peshitta was based on a revised form of the Diatessaron. A precise description of the relationship between the Peshitta and the Old Syriac and Diatessaron will continue to elude scholars until a critical edition of the Peshitta Gospels is published.</p>
<label type="subsection">Nature of the OT Translation</label>
<p>There has been an extensive debate among specialists of the OT Peshitta on the question of whether those text forms that are closer to the Hebrew text are representatives of an older stage of the Peshitta tradition or products of a revision. Studies on the books of Genesis and Exodus in the 5th cent. ms. 5b1 (Brit. Libr. Add. 14,425) eventually showed that a translation very close to the Hebrew model had developed into one that was easier to read and less ambiguous. Some phrases were replaced by more idiomatic Syriac ones or by expressions which better met the prevailing standards of literary Syriac. What is implicit in the Hebrew text and in the original translation was made explicit, for example, by adding the subject. Complicated sentences were clarified by slight additions or omissions, or by changes in word order. Finally, certain passages were harmonized in the process of transmission. All this happened during the first stages of the history of the Peshitta. For other books, it appears that we can discern a comparable first stage. The importance of ms. 9a1 (Florence, Bibl. Medicea Laurenziana, Or. 58) has been pointed out in this respect. Even though this is a much later ms., for some books it still preserves a text comparable to the Genesis and Exodus text of ms. 5b1.</p>
<p>The relative uniformity of mss. in later stages of the textual history, that is, after the 6th cent., suggests some kind of standardization: one text was chosen from a broader spectrum of texts which must have existed in the first stage. Koster’s research made it clear that after this second stage, represented by most mss. from the 6th until the 8th cent., further textual convergence can be observed. We can speak of a third stage, which he termed that of the <i>Textus Receptus</i> (others also speak of Standard Text). On the basis of <ref type="cr">Theo­doros bar Koni</ref>’s biblical quotations, we can say that the later Standard Text or <i>Textus Receptus</i> was already available in the East at the end of the 8th cent. On the other hand, the biblical text of the commentary of the monk <ref type="cr">Severos</ref> shows us that in the West, variation was still possible up to the end of the 9th cent., and that the western biblical ms. 9a1, which still represents the first stage of the development of the text, was not an isolated case.</p>
<p>Another issue that has been debated widely is the influence of other versions on the Peshitta. Some scholars have even suggested that the Peshitta was not a direct translation of the Hebrew, but based on an earlier Targum. It is, however, natural that two translations of the same text have something in common and could combine together against the source text because of the demands of the language or a similarity in interpretation  — all the more so if the two translations are written in dialects of the same language (see <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref>). There are no external data that prove contact between the Peshitta and the existing Targumim, and all parallels between the Targumim and the Peshitta can be explained as being the result of polygenesis or dependence on a common exegetical tradition. However, for the Septuagint, which is a translation into a completely different language, these explanations do not always suffice. In some books, notably Ezekiel and the Twelve Prophets, we have to assume some literary dependence of the Peshitta on the Septuagint. However, this dependence is not of a systematical nature, and may be the result of changes made in the later tradition.</p>
<label type="subsection">Nature of the NT Translation</label>
<p>The NT Peshitta contains twenty-two books; it lacks 
2–3  John, 2 Peter, Jude, and Revelation. It also omits John 7:53–8:11 (along with the Old Syriac and <ref type="cr">Ḥarqlean</ref> versions) and a few isolated verses, such as Luke 22:17–18. The history of the Syriac versions of the NT is characterized by gravitation toward the Greek text. Though, on occasion, the Peshitta preserves a Diatessaronic reading, where the Old Syriac reflects the Byzantine <i>Textus Receptus</i> (both the Sinaiticus and Curetonian mss. show signs of revision toward the Greek text), in general the Peshitta is closer than the Old Syriac to the <i>Textus Receptus</i>. It preserves readings that agree with the Western text type (Codex Bezae and the Old Latin), though many of its readings cannot be linked to any extant Greek witness. The readings unique to the Peshitta argue for its important role in NT textual criticism (Gwilliam 1903). The meticulous presentation of the Peshitta mss. for the Catholic and Pauline epistles by B. Aland and A. Juckel (1986–2002) reveals the homogeneity of these mss. The minor differences among them suggest that the Peshitta text of these epistles did not undergo a major revision during its transmission.</p>
<label type="subsection">The Importance of the Peshitta</label>
<p>The reason why the International Organization for the Study of the Old Testament took the initiative to produce a new edition of the OT Peshitta (see below) is its relevance for the textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible. The edition and the studies based on it have made it clear that the Hebrew model of the Peshitta must have been nearly identical with the so-called Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible, the standard form of the text handed down to us by a tradition of Jewish scholars, the Masoretes. The Peshitta even reflects a vocalization of the Hebrew text that stands very close to the vocalization recorded many centuries later by the Masoretes. Thus, the Old Testament Peshitta is a prime witness to the strength and quality of the Jewish tradition since the 2nd cent. In the small number of instances where the Peshitta can be demonstrated to go back to a text that differs from the Masoretic Text, it can be useful to correct errors in the latter.</p>
<p>Another issue of scholarly interest is the language of the OT Peshitta. It is one of the largest and oldest texts written in Syriac. A number of studies into the syntax of the Peshitta have already appeared, and the Leiden Peshitta Institute is conducting major research projects in this field (Van Keulen and Van Peursen 2006).</p>
<p>The NT Peshitta remains an important textual witness to the Greek NT since some of its readings are unique. NT textual critics must distinguish the readings that witness to Greek variants from those that witness to the Peshitta’s translation technique and/or exegesis (see, for example, Williams 2004). Continued research into the character of the NT Peshitta as a translation remains a <i>desideratum</i>. In addition to its text critical value, the NT Peshitta witnesses to the reception and interpretation of the Greek NT by Syriac-speaking Christians in the 4th–5th cent.</p>
<p>The Peshitta is, however, not only of interest to scholars. In the first place, it is the Bible of the Syriac Churches, and it has been a source of spirituality to them for ages. It is used in sermons, commentaries, <ref type="cr">poetry</ref>, and other genres of literature (see <ref type="cr">Exegesis, OT</ref>and <ref type="cr">Exegesis, NT</ref>). Its interpretations and exegetical traditions have colored the liturgy, and the prayers and hymns of the Syriac Churches follow the choice of words of the Peshitta. Many terms specific to the spirituality of the Syriac Churches have their origins in this ancient and reliable version of the OT and NT.</p>
<label type="subsection">Text Editions</label>
<p>The first printed edition of part of the Syriac OT was the edition of the Psalms that was published in Quzḥayya, Lebanon, in 1610. It was followed in 1625 by two more editions of the Psalms: that of the Maronite Gabriel Sionita (<ref type="cr">al-Ṣahyūnī, Jibrāʾīl</ref>), published in Paris, and that of Thomas van Erpe (Erpenius), a professor of Arabic, printed in Leiden, the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The first printed edition of the OT Peshitta as a whole is found in the Paris Polyglot. The Syriac text, edited by Gabriel Sionita, appeared in 1645. It was based on a rather poor ms.: 17a5 (Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 6). In its turn, the Paris Polyglot became the basis of the London Polyglot published by Brian Walton in 1657. This edition adds a number of variant readings from mss. present in English libraries, but otherwise just reproduces the Paris text. The text most widely available today goes back to that of Walton, and thus eventually to the Paris ms. 17a5: in 1823 Samuel Lee published his edition of the Peshitta under the auspices of the British and Foreign Bible Society, adopting the text of the London Polyglot while making some use of the so-called Buchanan Bible (Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Oo. I.1,2 = 12a1). The United Bible Societies have been publishing reprints of Lee’s edition up to this day.</p>
<p>Whereas Lee’s edition was printed in the W.-Syr. Serṭo script, the same century also saw two editions in E.-Syr. type: the so-called Urmia (1852) and Mosul (1887–92) Bibles. In parallel columns Urmia gives the text of the Peshitta based on Lee’s edition, corrected in some instances on the basis of mss. that were available locally, and a new translation of the Hebrew text into neo-Aramaic. It is assumed that the text of the Mosul edition, in its turn, made use of the Urmia edition. The Mosul edition was prepared by <ref type="cr">Clemens Joseph David</ref>, Syr. Cath. Archbishop of Damascus, and George ʿAbdishoʿ Khayyāṭ, Chaldean Archbishop of Diyarbakır; it was published by the <ref type="cr">Dominican</ref> Fathers. This edition also contains the text of the apocryphal or deutero-canonical books.</p>
<p>A 19th-cent. edition of a different nature was <ref type="cr">A. M. Ceriani</ref>’s facsimile publication of ms. 7a1, the oldest codex containing the complete text of the OT Peshitta, from the Ambrosian Library in Milan (ms. B 21 inf.). It was published in the years 1876–83. This publication was a landmark in Peshitta studies. For the first time, a text became available to a scholarly public that differed markedly from that of the Paris Polyglot. The first scientific edition, containing only the Psalms, was published by 
W. E. Barnes in 1904. He used 7a1 as his base text, but corrected it on the basis of a number of other mss. With the help of C. W. Mitchell and J. Pinkerton, the same author also published a new edition of the Pentateuch in 1914. This edition gives a corrected version of Lee’s text.</p>
<p>It was not until 1959, however, that the International Organization for the Study of the Old Testament decided to start the Peshitta project, which was entrusted to the Leiden Peshitta Institute. In 1972 the first volume of the new edition appeared, under the title <i>The Old Testament in Syriac according to the Peshitta Version</i>. The Leiden edition does not offer a critical text (one that tries to come as close to the original as possible). It prints a basic text, usually 7a1, with a number of emendations. Readings deemed impossible and readings not supported by two or more mss. dated before the year 1000 are emended. The <i>critical apparatus</i>, the list of variant readings, only includes mss. older than the 13th cent. The reason for this unorthodox approach, which resulted in a mixed text, was economy. The main text was meant as a point of reference: it should be common enough to guarantee a concise apparatus. This entails that the main text as such has no status. As De Boer writes: ‘The text printed in this edition — it must be stated <i>expressis verbis</i> — ought to be used in exegetical and textual study together with the apparatuses’ (De Boer, Preface to the Genesis-Exodus volume, p. viii). In other words, the reader cannot just quote the text; he or she should first go over the apparatus and do the work of the textual critic.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the shortcomings that are the result of its edition method, there is no doubt that the Leiden Peshitta edition is the most important tool for the study of the Peshitta of the OT. The edition will consist of 17 volumes, 13 of which have now appeared. The Peshitta Institute intends to publish additional volumes with the variants of biblical mss. up to and including the 15th cent. as well as studies of the text of the Syriac fathers, whose witness is considered very important. The main text of the edition is also available in electronic format through the website of the Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon (http://cal1.cn.huc.edu/).</p>
<p>The first printed edition of the Syriac NT was prepared by Johann Widmanstetter in 1555. A year later Immanuel Tremellius produced another edition. A critical edition of the Gospels (citing forty-two mss. from the 5th–12th cent.) was prepared by P. E.  Pusey and G. H.  Gwilliam (1901). Pusey and Gwilliam’s provisional text for the rest of the NT was combined with their edition of the Gospels to produce <i>The New Testament in Syriac</i> (The British and Foreign Bible Society, 1905–20). The minor Catholic letters (2 Peter, 2–3 John, and Jude) and the Book of Revelation in this edition are taken from J. Gwynn (1897 and 1909); these are remnants of the Philoxenian version (see <ref type="cr">Polykarpos</ref>). More recently, G.  Kiraz produced a comparative edition of the Syriac Gospels (Kiraz 1996) that aligns the Siniaticus and Curetonian mss. with the Peshitta and Ḥarqlean versions. A new critical edition of the Peshitta Gospels is needed, though the quantity of Peshitta mss. renders this a formidable task. The Institut für Neutestamentliche Text-
forschung at Münster has produced an edition of the Catholic and Pauline letters (B. Aland and A. Juckel 1986–2002) that aligns Peshitta mss. with the Ḥarqlean text and quotations from Syriac authors.</p>
<label type="subsection">Translation into English</label>
<p>The Peshitta has been translated into English by <ref type="cr">George M. Lamsa</ref>. Unfortunately, this translation has been assimilated to the Hebrew text in quite a few places, and is not based on a reliable text of the Peshitta. The latter point also applies to Andrew Oliver’s lesser known translation of the Peshitta Psalter. A new English annotated translation of the OT Peshitta is now being prepared by a group of scholars as one of the Leiden Peshitta Institute’s projects. It will appear under the title <i>The Bible of Edessa</i>. Portions of the NT have been translated into English by J. W. Etheridge (1846 and 1849) and by James Murdock (1851).</p>

<p>The son of Bosmarios, king of Georgia (Iberia), he was brought up in Constantinople as a political hostage at the court of the Emperor Theodosius II. Attracted to the ascetic life, he managed to escape, to become a monk in Palestine, eventually settling in a monastery near Gaza where he was a leading figure among opponents of the Council of Chalcedon (451). He was briefly bp. of Maiuma, but then had to take refuge in Egypt (455), only returning to Palestine twenty years later. Detailed biographies of him survive in Syriac (ed. with ET C. Horn and R. Phenix, 2008) and in Georgian (ET D. M. Lang, <i>Lives and Legends of the Georgian Saints</i> [1956]). The former, translated from Greek, was perhaps composed by <ref type="cr">John Rufus</ref>.

Twice he refused the office even though pressed by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref> but yielded, probably unwillingly, to pressure. Certainly his first official act was to visit his fellow-Syrian and co-religionist 
Damian, Pope of Alexandria (577/8–606/7) avowedly to offer his resignation if that would unite the quarrelling parties; for Damian, a vigorous and effective reformer, was the acknowledged leader in the partnership of Syrian and Egyptian Churches. The offer, if made, was refused and the death of one of the claimants resolved a difficulty. The visit to Alexandria unintentionally occasioned the conversion to the ‘synodite’, i.e. Chalcedonian cause of two accompanying expert theologians, <ref type="cr">Proba</ref> and <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon Barbur</ref>, who were to be duly condemned by a synod (584/585) at Peter’s probable residence (he was banned from entry into Antioch) of the monastery of Gubba Barraya. Peter wrote against them, but the work has not survived. Relations between Pope and Patriarch, at the outset warm apparently, became strained following the publication by Damian in ca. 585 of a defence of the unity of God in Trinity against the teaching of <ref type="cr">John Philoponus</ref> and others; they finally broke down and a schism between the Churches of Syria and Egypt was mended only in 616 after the death of both disputants. Peter’s extant literary legacy consists of: 1. an Anaphora in Syriac (ed. R. Y.  Ebied and L. R.  Wickham, in <i>Harp</i>23 [2008], 309–43); 
2. A <i>mimro</i> ‘On the Crucifixion’; 3. parts of seven Letters (see R. Y. Ebied, A. Van Roey and L. R. Wickham, in <i>OLA</i> 10 [1981]); and 4. works in connexion with the tritheist controversy: a. Rebuttal of those charged with Sabellianism (= Pope Damian and the ‘Damianites’) and who therefore spread the libellous report about us of holding the heathen dogmas of the Tritheists; 
b. a treatise originally in three books of which the second survives in part and the third complete; unnamed in the mss. it has been given the title Against Damian by its recent editors. Quite probably (a) is in fact the remains of the lost first book of the treatise. The genuineness of 3 and 4 (all in early and excellent Syriac translation from the Greek) is guaranteed by the general witness of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>; there is no reason to doubt Peter’s direct authorship of 2 and at least indirect of 1. The big treatise was valued for its extensive quotations from the Greek Fathers, extant florilegia being compiled from it and attesting the continuity and vigour of the Greek/W.-Syr. theological heritage.</p>

<p>Metropolitan bp. of Mabbug (modern Membij/ancient Hierapolis) (485–519), ascetic theologian, christological polemicist, and sponsor of the Philoxenian NT. Born in <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref> before 450, Philoxenos was educated in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> and likely ordained in <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> under Patr. Peter the Fuller (ca. 470s). With Peter, Philoxenos joined the controversies over the anti-Chalcedonian addition to the Trisagion. Exiled from Antioch under Patr. Calendio (482–484), Philoxenos sojourned among the monasteries of Syria. Supporting the Henotikon, Philoxenos visited Constantinople in 484 to offer Zeno a Miaphysite profession of faith. Upon Peter’s restoration in 485, Philoxenos was named metropolitan of Mabbug. Philoxenos soon established a reputation as a theologian of asceticism (following <ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>) and christology (following <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>). Writing primarily for monastic audiences, Philoxenos considered the fight against christological error to be a step in the ascetic pursuit of divine knowledge.</p>
<p>By the 490s, Philoxenos emerged as the senior leader of the anti-Chalcedonians in Syria and Mesopotamia, particularly after 498 when the pro-Chalcedonian Flavian was named Patr. of Antioch. Philoxenos had little success converting Mabbug to Miaphysite christology. Nevertheless, he used his thirty-year tenure to bolster Miaphysite theology throughout the Roman East and beyond (supporting missionaries in Persia and <ref type="cr">Nagran</ref>).</p>
<p>Philoxenos’s theology was very much centered on the Greek milieu of Antioch and Constantinople. Philoxenos came to mistrust traditional Syriac vocabulary as insufficient for expressing the nuances of Greek christological thought. He sought to bring Syriac theology closer to Greek terminology and established Mabbug as a center for translation. He sponsored a new translation of the NT into Syriac by the auxiliary bp. <ref type="cr">Polykarpos</ref>. Philoxenos himself wrote polemical commentaries on portions of Matthew, Luke, and John. No copies of the Philoxenian version are extant (having been superseded by the later <ref type="cr">Ḥarqlean</ref> translation), but firsthand evidence of the scriptorium survives in three mss. produced in Philoxenos’s own lifetime: London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,528; 14,534; and 17,126.</p>
<p>Philoxenos’s anti-Chalcedon efforts culminated in 512 when Flavian was ousted in favor of <ref type="cr">Severus</ref> as Patr. of Antioch. Philoxenos and his suffragan bishops (including a relation, Philoxenos of Doliche) assisted at Severus’s consecration. Although later opponents vilified Philoxenos and Severus as uncompromising, epistolary evidence reveals that they initially struck a conciliatory tone as they sought to consolidate Miaphysite control of the clergy in Syria and Anatolia.</p>
<p>In 519, Justin I exiled Philoxenos. In his final years, Philoxenos continued writing to monastic communities, encouraging them to persist in ascesis and Miaphysite christology. Philoxenos died in 523 under house arrest. Later traditions that he was executed are difficult to substantiate.</p>
<p>Philoxenos’s reputation grew after his death. Several 6th- and 7th-cent. mss. survive citing his works alongside Cyril and Severus. Philoxenos’s cult was strong in <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> where his relics were translated to a church dedicated to him in <ref type="cr">Midyat</ref> and to the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref>. In the 13th cent. <ref type="cr">Eli of Qarṭmin</ref> composed a valuable life of Philoxenos.</p>
<p>Although Philoxenos’s ascetic Discourses circulated widely in their entirety, the majority of his corpus was preserved only in the catena of polemical handbooks, stripping his christological polemics of their ascetic context. Considering his entire corpus, Philoxenos was no mere polemicist. He played the many roles of late antique bp., monastic leader, prolific theologian, biblical commentator, and would-be imperial 
counsellor.</p>
<p>Liturgical commemorations for Philoxenos are attested for 10 Dec., 18 Feb., 1 and 2 April, and 16 and 
18 Aug.</p>

<Author>D. A. Michelson</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Physiologus
</LemmaTitle><p>A collection of short texts, originally written in Greek, concerning natural history (mainly animals). The work, perhaps composed in Egypt in the late 2nd or 3rd cent., proved immensely popular and was translated into many different languages, including Syriac, Coptic, Armenian, Georgian, Arabic, Latin, Slavonic, Romanian, and various other European languages. The earliest form of the Greek text had 48 short chapters (edited by Sbordone 1936, and D. Offermanns 1966). Later forms of the text usually contain moralizing conclusions to each chapter. There are English translations of the Greek by F. J. Carmody (1953) and R. M. Grant, in his <i>Early Christians and Animals</i> (1999), 52–72.</p>
<p>The Syriac translation survives in several different forms: 1. an early form, containing 32 chapters (edited by O. G. Tychsen 1795); 2. an expanded edition, with 81 chapters, of which only the first 47 really belong to the Physiologus (edited by J. P. N. Land 1875); 3. a much longer text, entitled ‘The Book of Natural Beings’, with 125 chapters, of which only 45 are derived from the Physiologus (edited by K.

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Poetry
</LemmaTitle><p>The basic organizing principle of Syriac poetry is syllable (<i>hegyānā</i>) count. Although it has sometimes been claimed that stress patterns also played a role, this has never been satisfactorily substantiated. Rhyme is occasionally found in early poetry, but it is only used for special effect. The regular use of rhyme becomes a common feature from about the 9th cent. onwards, due to the influence of Arabic poetry. Acrostics, both alphabetic and spelling out the author’s name, are already found in <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>’s poetry.</p>
<p>There are two main forms of poetry: 1. The <i>memr</i><i>ā</i>, or narrative poem, employing couplets all in the same syllabic meter; the most common meters are those associated with <ref type="cr">Balai</ref> (5 syllable couplets), Ephrem (7 syllable couplets) and <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (12 syllable couplets, with each line consisting of 4+4+4 syllables). Other meters, such as 6+6 and 8+8 are less frequently found. Although the term <i>memrā</i> has been conventionally translated by Latin <i>carmen</i> ‘song’, <i>memre</i> were probably recited rather than sung; 2. The stanzaic poem, or <i>madrāšā</i> (often translated ‘hymn’); here each stanza (<i>baytā</i>) follows the same syllabic pattern (<i>mšuḥtā</i>). These patterns may either be simple, built up of units of the same number of syllables (e.g. stanzas of 5+5+5+5+5 syllables), or complex (e.g. 5+6 7+4 4+4 4+5). Ephrem already employs some 50 syllabic patterns, or <i>qāle</i>, and many more subsequently came into use; in this context the term <i>qālā</i> properly denotes the melody to which the <i>madrāšā</i> was to be sung, but the <i>qālā</i> title also serves as an indicator of the meter and would usually be taken from the opening words of a particular <i>madrāšā</i>; thus, for example, the <i>qālā</i> title for Ephrem’s Nisibene <i>madrāšā</i> no. 50 is given as <i>a(n)t mār(y) aktebtā</i><i>h</i>, which are the opening words of no. 10 of his <i>madrāše</i> on Faith. According to some scholars the <i>madrāšā</i> was not originally sung, and it was <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref> who introduced that aspect (see McVey 1999).</p>
<p>Later on, terms for certain sub-categories of the <i>madrāšā</i> were introduced, notably <i>qālā</i> and <i>soghithā</i>. In the liturgical books <i>qālā</i> became a generic term for stanzaic verse. The Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Yeshuʿ the Stylite</ref> (chap. 54), composed in Yaʿqub of Serugh’s own lifetime, speaks of Yaʿqub as having composed <i>soghyāthā</i> (and <i>zmirāthā</i>) as well as <i>memre</i>, and indeed a few of these survive, alongside his much more familiar <i>memre</i>. In due course the term <i>soghithā</i> came to designate four-line poems with a simple meter, usually 7+7 7+7 (or, in Maron. tradition, 8+8), with or without an alphabetic acrostic. A sub-category of the <i>soghithā</i> was the dialogue, or dispute, poem (normally with an alphabetic acrostic), where two protagonists speak in alternating verses. This particular literary genre, taken up in many different languages of the Middle East, can be traced back to the precedence disputes of Ancient Mesopotamia, and it has remained popular right up to the present day (some examples in Neo-Aramaic<ref type="cr"></ref>dialects are known).</p>
<p>Two Greek poetic repertoires were taken over (as prose translations) into the Syr. Orth. tradition, the <i>maʿnyotho</i> of <ref type="cr">Severus</ref> and others (often misleadingly entitled the Octoechos), and the <i>qonune</i>, or ‘canons’. It was under the influence of Melkite translations of Greek ‘canons’ by <ref type="cr">John of Damascus</ref>, Cosmas of Jerusalem, and others, that this particular new genre was adopted in the more westerly dioceses of the Syr. Orth. tradition: <i>qonune yawnoye</i> ‘Greek canons’, largely translated from Greek, took as their starting point the Canticles (or Odes), while the <i>qonune suryoye</i>, ‘Syriac canons’, were Syriac compositions, based on Ps. 51 (and other psalms).</p>
<p>From about the 9th cent. Syriac began to adopt various features characteristic of Arabic poetry; most notable among these were various forms of rhyme (initial and internal, as well as end rhyme). The influence of Arabic can also be seen in many of the poems that make up <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>’s ‘Paradise of Eden’, where all sorts of artifices, such as lipograms, can be found; that these have continued to be appreciated is indicated by the considerable number of mss. (and several printed editions) of this work. At least one later writer composed picture poems: thus in 1616 Gabriel, metropolitan of Ḥesno d-Kifo, provided such a poem in honour of Pope Paul V (illustrated in S. Giamil, <i>Genuinae relationes inter sedem apostolicam et Assyriorum orientalium seu Chaldaeorum ecclesiam</i> [1902], 159).</p>
<p>An early classification of the <i>qāle</i> used by Ephrem is found in a 7th-cent. ms. on Sinai (ed. A. de Halleux, in <i>LM</i>85 [1972], 171–99). The first Syriac writer, however, to write a treatise on poetry was <ref type="cr">Anṭun of Tagrit</ref> (9th cent.); this forms Book 5 (ed. J. W. Watt) of his larger work on ‘Rhetoric’. <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref> also devotes a section to the subject in his ‘Book of Dialogues’ (ed. J. P. P. Martin, with FT). In about the 12th/13th cent. the liturgical book known as the <i>Beth Gazo</i> emerged, classifying the melodies used and arranging them according to the eight tones (a system that enters the Syr. Orth. liturgical tradition from about the 9th century, according to Cody); somewhat analogous to the Greek Heirmologion, the <i>Beth Gazo</i> provides the model stanzas that accompanied each <i>qālā</i>. A number of printed editions of these have been published, both in India (Pampakuda, undated, 1986, 1997) and in Europe, going back to an edition (1913) by Dolabani (Glane/Losser, 1981, 1985); and in a much fuller form, 1992, based primarily on a ms. of 1554; editions provided with western musical notation have been prepared by Nuri Iskander (Aleppo, 1996 and 2003); the former of these two volumes represents the <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> tradition (and includes an Introduction on Syriac music by Mor Grigorios Yūḥannā Ibrāhīm), while the latter represents that of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. (The musical aspects of the <i>Beth Gazo</i> were the subject of a number of studies by J. Jeannin, H. Hussmann, and others). Many of the texts in an early Maronite <i>Beth Gazo</i> (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,703, of the 12th/13th cent.) have been edited by 
J. Tabet (Kaslik, 2001–4). (The E.-Syr. liturgical volume entitled Gazza is a hymnary of a different character).</p>
<p>In the 17th cent. the great Maron. Patr. and scholar, <ref type="cr">Isṭifān al-Duwayhī</ref>, set out to classify the model strophes according to their syllabic meters; this has now been edited and translated by L.  Hage (1987). In recent times the learned metropolitan of Mardin, Mar <ref type="cr">Philoxenos Yuḥanon Dolabani</ref> (d. 1969) wrote a short handbook on Syriac poetic form, published the year after his death (Aleppo, 1970); as he indicates in his preface, this is based on Anṭun and <ref type="cr">G. Cardahi</ref>’s <i>Liber thesauri de arte poetica syrorum</i> (1875; an anthology of late poets, with Arabic introduction).</p>
<p>Since verse has always frequently been a medium of instruction, it can be found used also for subjects that might surprise Western readers, such as exegesis, astronomy, chronology, and grammar.</p>
<p>A list of the main Syriac poets in the Syr. Orth. tradition is given by <ref type="cr">Barsoum</ref>, <i>Scattered pearls,</i>35–8, where he provides four separate categories, according to their quality. His first category includes Ephrem, <ref type="cr">Qurillona</ref>, the various persons named <ref type="cr">Isḥaq, Shemʿun Quqoyo</ref>, Yaʿqub of Serugh, <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, <ref type="cr">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>, Bar Sobto, Bar Qiqi, Bar Sabouni, Timotheos of Gargar, Bar Andrawos, <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon bar Maʿdani</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Bar</ref> ʿ<ref type="cr">Ebroyo</ref>. To these one might add, from the 
E.-Syr. tradition, <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>, <ref type="cr">Eliya of al-Anbār</ref>, <ref type="cr">Emmanuel bar Shahhare</ref>, ʿAbdishoʿ of Soba, <ref type="cr">Gewargis Warda</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Khamis bar Qardaḥe</ref>. A large amount of poetry continues to be produced in Classical Syriac right up to the present day. Finally, it should not be forgotten that a great deal of anonymous poetry, for the most part transmitted in liturgical mss., is of very high quality.</p>

<p>Chorepiscopus of the diocese of Mabbug, who was commissioned with the translation of the NT (and parts of the OT) by <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> (the so-called Philoxenian version). The only information about Polykarpos derives from his contemporary <ref type="cr">Mushe of Aggel</ref>. In the introductory letter to Paphnutius, prefixed to his own Syriac translation of <ref type="cr">Cyril</ref>’s explanation of the Pentateuch (‘Glaphyra’), Mushe refers to the ‘edition of the NT and of David (i.e. Psalms) that the deceased Chorepiscopus made for Philoxenos of Mabbug in Syriac’ (Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 2, 82–3; Guidi, 404, 410–12). This piece of information is unsuspicious, as later references to this version link it directly with Philoxenos without mentioning Polykarpos (<ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, Ecclesiastical History, ed. Abbeloos and Lamy, I, 50 = vol. 1, col. 267; II, 22 = vol. 3, col. 89; proem to the <i>Awṣar Roze</i>; <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, Chronicle, X, 25 = vol. 4, 391). Scholars also prefer the commissioner’s prominent name (‘Philoxenian’) to that of the otherwise unknown translator. The instigation and intention of the version actually derive from Philoxenos. It was designed for serving the miaphysite cause by providing a Syriac NT version, sufficiently close to the Greek, in order to defend miaphysite Christology and doctrine. In his ‘Commentary on the Prologue of John’ (ed. A. de Halleux, CSCO 380, 1977) Philoxenos points to several imprecise translations in the<ref type="cr"> Peshitta</ref>, which was to be replaced by an entirely new translation.</p>
<p>While Bar ʿEbroyo and Michael provide an approximate date for Polykarpos’s version by linking it with Philoxenos, the subscriptions of the <ref type="cr">Ḥarqlean Version</ref> (615/16) give the exact date ‘819 of Alexander of Macedonia’ (= AD 507/08). These subscriptions provide additional information: first, that the Greek model was associated with Caesarea in Palestine and with the famous library directed by Pamphilus; second, that this version for the first time included the Minor Catholic Epistles and Revelation, neither of which was part of the Peshitta canon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately no ms. of the original version survives. Our knowledge of the version’s text derives from four sources: 1. from quotations in the later writings of Philoxenos (collected in part by B. Aland); 2. from quotations in the margins of the <ref type="cr">Masora</ref> mss. (ed. N. Wiseman 1828); 3. from quotations preserved in the Euthalian prologue to the Pauline epistles (ed. S. Brock 1979); and 4. from a 6th-cent. translation of the Minor Catholic Epistles and Revelation (ed. J. Gwynn 1909, 1897), extant almost exclusively in mss. of the second millennium (an Arabic translation of the epistles exists in ms. Sin. Arab. 154, ed. M. Dunlop Gibson 1899). This translation can only be identified with Polykarpos’s version by internal evidence (Gwynn 1909, introduction). All these remnants reveal the version’s intermediary position between the Peshitta and the Ḥarqlean regarding the refinement of translation technique; it is closer to the Greek than the Peshitta, but is not a ‘mirror translation’ of the Greek like the Ḥarqlean (in general, see <ref type="cr">Greek, Syriac translations from</ref>).</p>
<p>Polykarpos’s version received a thorough revisional update, which resulted in the Ḥarqlean Version (615/16). This might be the reason for the almost complete disappearance of Polykarpos’s version, which was outdated by the new. Fortunately essential information on Polykarpos’s version was included and thus preserved in the Ḥarqlean subscriptions. Nevertheless, the revisional relationship between Polykarpos’s original version and the update prepared by <ref type="cr">Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref> remained unclear so long as genuine Philoxenian texts for comparison were not available. The ‘Philoxenian-Ḥarqlean problem’ centered around the question of whether Tumo simply re-issued Polykarpos’s version adding material to the text and margins or whether he produced a new independent version. This problem derives not only from the ambiguity of the Ḥarqlean subscriptions, but also from the ‘Mohl ms.’ (now Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Add. 1700; without Ḥarqlean annotations). The heading (<i>inscriptio</i>) to Acts in this ms. reads: ‘The Acts of the Twelve Holy Apostles according to the tradition of the holy Mor Aksnoyo (<i>ayk mašlmonutho d-qaddišo Mor Aksnoyo</i> [i.e. Philoxenos])’. However, the subscriptions prove that the ms. is surely Ḥarqlean. The view that the Ḥarqlean is a new (though not totally independent) version turned out to be substantially correct. In addition to the attached textual material, Tumo introduced a refinement of translation technique that turned Polykarpos’s original version into a ‘mirror translation’. Polykarpos’s version was an attractive starting point for Tumo’s own version due to its already close adherence to the Greek and the connection of its underlying Greek text with Pamphilus’s famous library in Caesarea. It was this underlying Greek text that Tumo wished to preserve and to mirror in his own version, and he was not interested in preserving Polykarpos’s version for its own sake.</p>
<p>The ‘Philoxenian-Ḥarqlean problem’ arose with the <i>editio princeps</i> of the Ḥarqlean in 1778–1803, which the editor J. White considered to be the annotated re-­issue of Polykarpos’s version and so entitled it <i>Sacrorum Evangeliorum versio syriaca philoxeniana</i>. Those who argued for an independent new version tried to identify mss. of Polykarpos’s original version. J. G. Ch. Adler claimed that ms. Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana Plut. I,40 was the earlier version; G. Bernstein favored ms. Rome, Bibl. Angelica 74. The choice of these scholars was directed by the absence of annotations from these codices. They are, however, nothing other than Ḥarqlean mss. that lost their annotations in the course of transmission (a common feature of Ḥarqlean mss.).</p>
<p>There is reason to assume that Polykarpos also translated some of the OT since Mushe of Aggel mentions the Psalms alongside the NT (see above). Moreover, a quotation of Is. 9:6 in the Milan <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref> is attributed to the version, ‘which was translated through the care of the holy Philoxenos’. Ceriani edited and identified as possibly ‘Philoxenian’ a fragmentary version of Isaiah (preserved in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 17,106), which is translated from Greek, but agrees with neither the Syro-Hexapla nor the version of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>. The extensive study of R. G. Jenkins supplies evidence for at least Gen., Ex., and Isa. (not for Ps.!) that ‘Philoxenos came under the influence of a Greek form of certain Old Testament books’. As this influence can only be traced in writings from the later period of Philoxenos’s life (corresponding to his use of Polykarpos’s NT version), it is very likely that Polykarpos also produced a translation of individual OT books.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Printing
</LemmaTitle><p>Syriac printed from wood-cuts can be found in European books as early as 1486, but the first text to be printed from type was in <ref type="cr">T. Ambrogio</ref>’s <i>Introductio in linguam chaldaicam</i> (Pavia, 1539). Later in the century and on into the 18th cent., presses in Rome (the Tipografia Medicea, 1592; Maronite College, 1617; and Propaganda Fide, 1627), took the lead in the production of Syriac books, chiefly service-books but also grammatical and other scholarly works. All these presses used well-cut Serṭo types based on Maronite handwriting. A type in the same style cut for F. Savary de Brèves was first used in Paris for a Psalter in 1624; and another for the polyglot Bible of M. Le Jay (starting with vol. 5, 1630). Elsewhere in Europe, Syriac printing began with J. Widmanstetter’s New Testament printed in Vienna in 1555. Other biblical and scholarly printing followed, especially in the Netherlands (C. Plantin, 1569; T. Erpenius, 1619; Elsevier, 1630) and eventually in Britain (1639). The Serṭo types in these books were generally independent of the Maron. models, and inferior.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, a Syriac Psalter was printed at the Maron. monastery of Quzḥayya, Lebanon, as early as 1610, but nothing followed there until the printing of service books began again after 1782. East of Lebanon, Syriac printing started with the American ‘Nestorian Mission’ in <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref>, Persia. The missionaries reduced the local dialect to writing (using the E.-Syr. script), and began to print in it in 1841. They used at first the type made by W. Watts for an E.-Syr. edition of the New Testament (London, 1829), then new types made by the mission printer Edward Breath. The output of this press was chiefly Protestant religious literature, but it also included a long-running newspaper <i>Zahrire d-bahrā</i> ‘Rays of Light’ (1849–1918). Among other mission and church presses in the Middle East in the 19th–20th cent., the most important printers of Syriac were the Imprimerie des Pères Dominicains in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> (ca. 1857) and the Jesuit Imprimerie Catholique in <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref> (ca. 1877).</p>
<p>In India, Syriac has been printed by various church-owned presses since the 19th cent. The most important are St. Joseph’s Press, Mannanam (1866), St. Thomas Press, Cochin (1870), Mar Julius Press, Pampakuda (1870), and Mar Narsai Press, Trichur (1926). Most of the types used in their books are of Indian manufacture.</p>
<p>A Linotype version of E.-Syr. was first made in 1915, for Joel E. Werda’s newspaper <i>Izgadda</i> (New York, later Connecticut, 1915–25). Hand and Linotype composition produced a good deal of secular <ref type="cr">Assyrian</ref> journalism and other literature between the wars in the USA and in Iran and Iraq.</p>
<p>Printing of scholarly Syriac was stimulated in the mid 19th cent. by the acquisition of old mss. by the British Museum. The years 1848–1914 saw a boom in publications, many in the Esṭrangela script and printed to a high standard of typography and presswork, notably by Oxford and Cambridge University presses, the Imprimerie Nationale (Paris) and W. Drugulin (Leipzig). For the Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium (printed by the firm of Peeters in Louvain), the British Monotype Corporation produced an Esṭrangela type in 1954 designed by R. Draguet that allowed machine composition of this script for the first time. A film version for the Monophoto typesetter followed in 1977.</p>
<p>Since the mid 1980s, digital technology has democratized the printing of Syriac at all levels: ecclesiastical, academic, and vernacular. Syriac text may now be composed on a personal computer, using ordinary word-processing software and fonts available for all the Syriac scripts, and sent electronically in pdf format to a commercial printer for lithographic reproduction.</p>

<p>Syriac commentator on <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>’s writings on logic. The juxtaposition of Proba with <ref type="cr">Hiba</ref> and Komi in the ‘Catalogue’ of <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> has led to the view that he was associated with the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref> and belonged to the first half of the 5th cent. On internal evidence, however, this is impossible, since he is clearly writing at a later date than the Neoplatonist Proclus (died 485), whom he even mentions by name (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,660, f. 23rv); on the other hand, a date close to that of <ref type="cr">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref> (thus Suermann) is likely to be too late, and a 6th-cent. date seems most likely. In two mss. (Berlin, Sachau 226, and Mingana Syr. 606) he is described as ‘priest, archdeacon and <i>archiatros</i> (chief doctor) of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>’.</p>
<p>Three works by Proba are extant:</p>
<p>1. A commentary on <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Introduction’ (to Aristotle’s logical works). Of this an extract was published by Baumstark (4*–12* [Syr.], 148–56 [GT]), corresponding to f. 23r–28v in a longer (but acephalous) text in Mingana Syr. 606, f. 1–28v. There are also fragments of a 9th-cent. ms. preserved in Brit. Libr. Add. 17,215, f. 7–8 and Dayr al-Suryān Syr. Fragment 88. According to Suermann (1994) this work, unlike the others, can be dated to a time between Hiba and <ref type="cr">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref>, but this is very problematic.</p>
<p>2. A commentary on Aristotle’s ‘On Interpretation’, ed. Hoffmann, 62–89; an earlier ms., Brit. Libr. Add. 14,660, f. 1–46 (9th/10th cent.) contains a much longer but acephalous text (f. 1r–6r corresponds to Hoffmann 79–89). According to Mingana Syr. 606, f. 140v, the Syriac translation of the ‘On Interpretation’ (ed. Hoffmann, 23–55) was by Proba, as well, but in the other mss. it is anonymous.</p>
<p>3. A commentary on Aristotle’s Prior Analytics, ed. van Hoonacker.</p>
<p>Possibly also by him is a proposal ‘by Proba the philosopher’ for an improved numbering system in Syriac, still using the letters of the alphabet (Berlin, Sachau 153; excerpt in Sachau, <i>Verzeichnis</i>, 33–4).</p>
<p>It is just possible that this Proba is the same person as the <ref type="cr">Proba</ref> who accompanied Patr. <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref> to Alexandria ca. 581, who ended up as Chalcedonian metropolitan of Chalcedon.</p>

<p>Metropolitan of Chalcedon. Most of what is known about this Proba comes from the only extant fragment of <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref>’s Chronicle (CSCO 84, 219–24; GT in Abramowski). In ca. 581 Patr. <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref> took Proba and <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon Barbur</ref> with him to Alexandria as advisers. There they met a sophist Stephanos, whose views on a highly technical point of christology they at first opposed, but were then won over by. Both Proba and Yuḥanon were subsequently excommunicated by Peter, after a synod at Gubba Barraya ca. 585. Proba ended up as Chalcedonian metropolitan of Chalcedon. Fragments of Proba’s Syriac writings from different periods are preserved in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,155. His ‘Questions against the Jacobites’, written after his conversion, survive in both Greek (in which they were written; ed. Declercq, in <i>Byzantion</i> 53 [1983], 213–32) and in fragmentary Syriac translation (ed. Bettiolo [CSCO 403; 1979], 8–14).</p>

<p>Bp. of Cyzicus and since 434 Patr. of Constantinople. His literary work, all in Greek, consists of homilies and letters. His homilies enjoyed great popularity and were translated into several languages. While Leroy’s 1967 study surveyed 34 homilies, the authors of <i>CPG</i> list 37 homilies, without counting those of dubious authenticity (<i>CPG</i> 5800–5836). A number of these have found their way into the Syr. homiliaries, in particular of the Syr. Orth. tradition. Three homilies were published by Chabot: Hom. 23 (‘On the dogma of the incarnation’); Hom. 24 (‘On the Nativity’, edited in a different version by Moss); and Hom. 25 (‘On St. Clement bp. of Ancyra’). Hom. 1 (‘On the Mother of God’, delivered in Constantinople in 428 or 429, in the presence of Nestorius) was edited by Lucchesi. Both Lebon and Brière edited Hom. 5 (‘On the Virgin and Mother of God’), which in the Syr. version is expanded with a homily by Atticus of Constantinople. Hom. 17 (‘On St. Stephen the first martyr’) is in the Syriac version attributed to <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref>; it was edited by Malki. Sauget edited Hom. 37 (1969: ‘On the Ascension of Jesus Christ’). Homilies that exist in Syriac, but have not yet been edited are: nos. 3 (‘On the Incarnation’; Leroy, 75); 10 (‘On Holy Friday’; Leroy, 110–11); 13 (‘On the Pascha’; Sauget 1969, 6); 30 (‘On Holy Friday and on the Trinity’, which does not exist in Greek; Sauget 1961, 406 and Leroy, 212–23).</p>
<p>Among Proclus’s correspondence, one letter in particular became very influential: the letter that he wrote as patr., probably in 435, to the Armenians, which is known as the ‘Tomos to the Armenians’ (<i>CPG</i> 5897). Written shortly after the Council of Ephesus (431), it contains a balanced, albeit somewhat vague, Christological exposition, which was understood as a rejection of dyophysite Christology associated with the names of <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref> and <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> (neither of whom is mentioned by name in the text). There exist three different Syriac versions: the first is preserved in a 7th-cent. miaphysite Florilegium (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,557) and was edited by Bedjan; the second was incorporated in the Ecclesiastical History attributed in Syr. to <ref type="cr">Zacharias</ref> (ed. Brooks); the third was included in a 6th-cent. miaphysite Florilegium (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,156) and remains unpublished. Whereas the first and second version represent the same translation (of which the text in Ps.-Zacharias is a revision), the third version is an independent and more accurate translation of the Greek, which probably belongs to the early 6th century, while the other translation is typologically earlier.</p>
<p>Proclus’s works were often used in later Christological treatises and florilegia. <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> quotes both from the homilies and from the ‘Tomos’, while Miaphysite florilegia contain several excerpts from the ‘Tomos’. Quotations from Proclus in the works attributed to <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon Maron</ref> and in the later Maronite tradition have been studied by Breydy.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Psalms, Syriac Apocryphal</LemmaTitle>
<p>The Syriac Apocryphal Psalms are a group of five poetic compositions related to the book of Psalms (ed. Baars). The most important textual witness for the Syriac Apocryphal Psalms is ms. Baghdad (formerly Mosul), Library of the Chaldean Patriarchate 1113, which can be dated paleographically to the 12th cent. In this ms., the Apocryphal Psalms follow directly upon the canonical Psalms and are numbered consecutively as 151–155. The margins of this ms. contain a number of alternative readings. The Syriac Apocryphal Psalms are also found as filler material in mss. of the <i>Ktābā d-Durrāšā</i> ‘Book of Exercise’ by <ref type="cr">Eliya of al-Anbār</ref> (first half of the 10th cent.). The order of the Apocryphal Psalms in mss. of the <i>Ktābā d-Durrāšā</i> differs from that in the Chaldean 
Patriarchate ms. (I = 151; II = 154; III = 155; IV = 152; 
V = 153). In addition, the text of the Apocryphal Psalms in these mss. diverges from that in the Chaldean Patriarchate ms., though it often agrees with that represented in the margins of this ms. A version of the Apocryphal Psalms similar to that in mss. of the <i>Ktābā d-Durrāšā</i>is also found appended to ms. Berlin, Orient. Fol. 3122, which contains the prophetic books of the OT. Finally, Psalm 151 (= I) also exists in Syriac outside the collection of Apocryphal Psalms, both in the <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref> (and in liturgical mss. based on it) and in some mss. independent from, and in some cases earlier than, the Syro-Hexapla (see Baars, vii-ix; van Rooy 2000).</p>
<p>Psalm 151 (= I) is a translation of the Septuagint Psalm 151. This Psalm is known in other Psalter traditions that are based on the Septuagint, e.g. Latin, Coptic, Arabic, Armenian, and Ethiopic. The Hebrew Vorlage of Psalm 151 was discovered fragmentarily preserved in the Qumran Psalms Scroll (11QPs<sup>a</sup>) as two separate psalms designated 151A and 151B (ed. Sanders 1963; 1965, 54–64). A Hebrew Vorlage for both Psalm 154 (= II) and Psalm 155 (= III) is also found in the Qumran Psalms Scroll (11QPs<sup>a</sup>; ed. Sanders 1964; 1965, 64–76). A Hebrew Vorlage has not, however, been discovered for either Psalm 152 (= IV) or Psalm 153 (= V). Some maintain that this is only an accident of survival and that these two Psalms were translated from a now lost Hebrew Vorlage (see, e.g., van Rooy, van der Woude). Others, however, argue that these two Psalms are original Syriac compositions (see, e.g., Skehan). In his Letter 47, Cath. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref><LemmaTitle></LemmaTitle>(d. 823) mentions the discovery of Hebrew mss., some of which contained additional ‘Psalms of David’, in the region of Jericho (ed. O. Braun, ‘Ein Brief des Katholikos Timotheos I über biblische Studien des 9. Jahrhunderts’, <i>OC</i> 1 [1901], 299–313; ET in S. P. Brock, <i>A brief outline of Syriac literature</i>[2nd ed. 2009], 240–45). This not only anticipates the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls by more than a millennium, but also may help to explain the existence of Psalms 154–155 (and possibly also 152–153) in the Syriac tradition.</p>

<Author>A. M. Butts</Author><LemmaTitle>Qara</LemmaTitle>
<p>Town in the Qalamun mountains, Syria, ca. 95 km. northeast of <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref> and less than 20 km. north of Nabk (see <ref type="cr">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>), often mentioned as a caravan station between <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref> and Damascus. Qara’s Christian history can be traced back to the 5th cent. (mentioned as Chonachara or Chonochara). In the Christological controversies of the 5th and 6th cent. it was on the side of the Chalcedonians. After a long period during which the sources are silent, Qara reemerges around 1100, still as a center of <ref type="cr">Melkite</ref> Christianity. Bp. Michael of Qara is attested for the second half of the 12th cent., and he himself has left us a list of some of his predecessors (Schmidt, 27–9). The Muslim authors Ibn Jubayr (who visited Qara in July 1184) and Yāqūt (1225) report that in their day Qara was entirely Christian. In 1266, however, Sultan Baybars, in his offensive against the Crusaders and Mongols, expelled or killed the Christians of Qara, which then became a Muslim town. It was able to regain some of its Christian population in the following decades and to recreate its episcopal see, no later than ca. 1400. In the first half of the 15th cent. Bp. Makarios built a scriptorium in Dayr Mar Yaʿqub, in which a number of Syriac and Arabic mss. were produced, mostly by bps. and priests belonging to some influential families. In the 17th cent., due to the ongoing islamization of the Qalamun region, the episcopal see of Qara lost its independence and was joined together with Ṣaydnāyā. The Monastery of Mar Yaʿqub, which had lost some of its earlier prestige, was destroyed by an earthquake in 1759 and remained in ruins. In the 18th cent., Qara moved into the orbit of the Melkite-Catholic Church, to which most of the small Christian minority of Qara’s population nowadays belong.<ref type="cr"></p>
</ref><p><ab type="infobox"/>Today Qara has two historically important Christian sites, both of which are still in use. One is the Church of Sts. Sergius and Bacchus; the other is Dayr Mar Yaʿqub, just outside the town. The Church of Sergius and Bacchus contains partly preserved<ref type="cr"> wall paintings, some of which have inscriptions in Greek and Syriac (</ref>Esṭrangela<ref type="cr">). The upper parts of five scenes are preserved on the north wall of the church: the breastfeeding Virgin, flanked by two equestrian saints, Theodore (left) and Sergius (right); John the Baptist; and (traces of) an unidentified female saint.</p>
</ref><p><ref type="cr">Dayr Mar</ref>Ya<ref type="cr">ʿqub, dedicated to the E.-Syr. saint</ref>Ya<ref type="cr">ʿqub ‘the mutilated’ (‘the dissected’, Syr. <i>mpassqā</i>, Arab. <i>muqaṭṭa</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʿ, or Lat. Intercisus; cf. Fiey,</ref><i>Saints syriaques</i><ref type="cr">, 107–8), is first attested with this name in the 15th cent. (Schmidt, 43). Its main church, however, in all likelihood goes back to the 11th cent. After it had fallen into ruins, in the 18th cent., it was neglected for more than two centuries; several of its wall paintings were transferred to the National Museum of Damascus and to the museum of nearby Dayr ʿAtiya. It was only in the 1990s that, under the leadership of Sœur Agnès-Maria de la Croix, the monastery with its church was rebuilt and became the home of a community of female ascetics, belonging to the jurisdiction of the Melkite-Catholic bp. of Ḥimṣ, Ḥama, Yabrud, and Qara. Within the framework of this rebuilding and restoration project several of the paintings were returned to the monastery. Together with the newly discovered paintings, they were studied in a monograph by Schmidt and Westphalen (2005).</p>
</ref><p>The church of the monastery has a remarkable structure in that it consists of an upper and lower church, sharing the same apse construction. Accordingly, there are two parallel levels of decoration which, moreover, each were decorated twice, first in the 11th  cent. and again in the 13th cent. (before 1266). The various iconographic programs can be reconstructed only very imperfectly. Among the earliest paintings, there is a row of enthroned apostles (upper apse) and scenes from the life of Christ (nave of the lower church, probably by a different artist). As for the 13th-cent. layer, there are remnants of a large Deisis composition in the lower apse. In addition, both apses have a row of images of bps. or church fathers. Although heavily damaged, a few still show inscriptions with their names written in Greek and Syriac (Esṭrangela, running from top to bottom). Independent from the paintings, and written on the first layer of plaster, are two carefully written prayers, one in Syriac (Schmidt, 151–2) and one in Greek.</p>
<p>In addition to their significance for art-historical studies and as a witness of the ongoing presence of Christian culture in the Qalamun mountains, the paintings and inscriptions in Qara provide precious information on the use of Syriac among the Melkites.</p>

<p>He was born in Qarabash near Diyarbakır (<ref type="cr">Amid</ref>). In 1911 his bp.

In 1921 he went back to Diyarbakır, then escaped from the military service and went to <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>, where he spent some time with <ref type="cr">Isḥāq Armalah</ref>.

<p>He wrote: 1. A series of Syriac readers, <i>herge d-qeryono</i>, from kindergarten until eighth grade which are still used today in the Middle East and the diaspora (reprinted many times). 2. A grammar titled <i>mdaršono bqonune dlešono</i> (Qamishli 1963, 2nd ed. 1980, 3rd ed. 1986). 3.

</LemmaTitle><p>A sizable town located to the east of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, on the same road along which <ref type="cr">Barṭelle</ref> and <ref type="cr">Karamlish</ref> are located. Its name is Turkish, lit. ‘the black bird’, but it is also called in Syriac <i>Beth Khudedā</i>, <i>Bukhdedā</i>, or <i>Baghdedā</i> (among other conflicting spellings) and in Arabic <i>al-Ḥamdāniyya</i>. Its history is best known from the 12th   cent. onward although the town must have existed much earlier. Qaraqosh contains the remains of at least three maphrians, Yuḥanon IV (1189) and two others who lived during the 15th cent. In his Chronicle, <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> mentions it as the scene of violence at the hands of Kurds and Tatars, and in his Ecclesiastical History he discusses the mostly good relations between the local people and the maphrians residing in <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>. Monks native to Qaraqosh are attested in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in Egypt. Here lived the highly skilled scribe and miniaturist Bacchus as evidenced in one ms. dated to 1257. The invasion of the Persian Nādir Shāh in 1743 destroyed it almost entirely, but it was soon rebuilt magnificently as reflected in the art, architecture, and Syriac <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref> of its churches. The bp. of <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Behnam</ref>, Karas of ‘Khudeda’ played a crucial role in the rebuilding activities. There are currently nine churches in Qaraqosh, some truly monumental, including two recent ones. In antiquity Qaraqosh belonged to the Ch. of E., but it shifted to the Syr. Orth. Church around the beginning of the 
7th cent. under the influence of Dayro d-Mor Matay, and around the middle of the 18th cent., it turned almost entirely Syr. Cath. In the late 1950s it was inhabited by some seven thousand people speaking <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref>, but the number today is less certain.</p>

<p>The Qarqaphto (‘Skull’) Monastery was located near the town of Magdal on the Khabur river southeast of <ref type="cr">Reshʿayna</ref>, in the Jazīra region of Syria. According to tradition, a certain Mor Shemʿun was the founder of this monastery. The Qarqaphto Monastery blossomed between the 8th and 10th cent. and was famous as a center for biblical philology.</p>
<p>There is little direct archeological or ms. evidence from the Qarqaphto Monastery. One surviving ms. from this monastery is dated to 839 (Brit. Libr. Add. 17,215). The fragments of this ms. contain comments on Greek philosophical vocabulary in Syriac. References to the monks of the Qarqaphto monastery are also found in mss. of the so-called Syriac<ref type="cr"> Masora</ref>. A small number of these mss. (Vat. Syr. 152, Brit. Libr. Add. 7183, and Damascus Patr. 12/22) attribute vocalized selections from the OT and NT to the ‘Qarqaphian tradition’ (<i>mašlmonutho qarqphoyto</i>). Most Syriac Masora mss. also contain marginal notes attributed to monks of the Qarqaphto Monastery (<i>qarqphoye</i>) along with notes by other philologists.</p>
<p><ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> is the best-known source of information for writings associated with the Qarqaphto Monastery. In the introduction to his grammar ‘The Book of Splendors’ (<i>Ktobo d-ṣemḥe</i>), Bar ʿEbroyo attributes the development of W.-Syr. Greek vowel signs to Qarqaphto monks. He also includes <i>qarqphoye</i> biblical readings in his Scriptural commentary the ‘Storehouse of mysteries’ (<i>Awṣar roze</i>). In his ‘Candelabrum of the sanctuary’ (<i>Mnorat qudše</i>), Bar ʿEbroyo lists the <i>qarqphoyto</i> as a ‘version’, or ‘translation’, (<i>mappaqto</i>) of the NT used by the Syr. Orth., along with the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> and the <ref type="cr">Ḥarqlean</ref> (PO 31.1, 120). At times Bar ʿEbroyo disagrees with the biblical readings of the Qarqaphto monks.</p>
<p>Scholars working before the mid-19th cent. such as <ref type="cr">J. S. Assemani</ref> and N. Wiseman believed that these references to the <i>mašlmonutho qarqphoyto</i> and <i>qarqphoye</i> in the Syriac Masora and in the works of Bar ʿEbroyo were allusions to a ‘version’ or ‘revision’ of the Bible. The inclusion, in these same writings, of the term <i>maš</i><i>lmonutho</i> in reference to the ‘versions’ of the Ḥarqlean and <ref type="cr">Syro-Hexapla</ref> seemed to legitimize the translation ‘version’ when used for <i>qarqphoyto</i>. In the late 19th-cent. J. P. P. Martin argued that <i>mašlmonutho qarqphoyto</i> was not a ‘version’ of the Bible, but a ‘tradition’ of vocalizing and pointing the biblical text transmitted by the monks of the Qar­qaphto Monastery. Martin’s conclusions were eventually accepted by the majority of scholars, although some disagreed. One of the most vocal opponents of Martin was Isaac Hall who fought against what he called ‘Abbé Martin’s hoax’ (Hall 1885) in published articles and in presentations to the newly-minted Society of Biblical Literature. It is now generally understood that the works of eminent philologists from the Qarqaphto Monastery influenced the compilers of Syriac Masora mss. But the exact role monks from Qarqaphto played in the composition and transmission of all or part of the existing masoretic mss. remains unclear.</p>

<p>A W.-Syr. monastery that in its heyday (6th–9th cent.) stood out as a center of Greek study in the Syriac-speaking Near East and which played a key role in the transmission of Greek learning into Syriac. ‘Qenneshre’ means ‘eagles’ nest’ and should not be confused with the northern Syrian town of Qenneshrin or Chalcis (Ar. <i>Qinnasr</i><i>īn</i>). Arabic sources refer to the monastery as Qinnisrī. According to Yāqūt, Qenneshre was located on the eastern shore of the Euphrates River in the Jazīra, facing Jirbās (i.e. Europos), four parasangs from Mabbug, seven parasangs from Serugh. Yāqūt also adds that Qenneshre was a ‘large’ monastery that had some 370 monks when it was inhabited.</p>
<p>In the context of increasing imperial pressure on miaphysite monks throughout northern Syria, <ref type="cr">John bar Aphtonia</ref> led a group of monks from the monastery of St. Thomas near Seleucia Pieria, where he was Abbot, to the banks of the Euphrates and there founded Qenneshre ca. 530; some evidence suggests that it, too, may have been dedicated to St. Thomas. Scholars disagree as to whether mention of the ‘monastery of Beth Aphtonia’ in Syriac texts should be understood as a reference to Qenneshre. The monastery of St. Thomas in Seleucia-Pieria seems to have been known as a center of Greek studies and Qenneshre continued this tradition. <ref type="cr">Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref>, <ref type="cr">Athanasios II of Balad</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> all studied Greek at Qenneshre. <ref type="cr">Severos Sebokht</ref>, Athanasios II’s teacher, was also likely associated with the monastery and <ref type="cr">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>, probably studied there as well. Many important translations from Greek into Syriac of both secular and religious works were undertaken by these men and others trained at Qenneshre. A note in ms. Oxford (Bodleian) Poc. 10, which contains the hymns of Severus translated by <ref type="cr">Pawla of Edessa</ref>, informs us that Pawla’s translation was made ‘according to the tradition of Qenneshre.’ A study of the translation technique of scholars trained at Qenneshre remains a desideratum. Qenneshre also played a significant role in the life of the Syr. Orth. Church, providing it with a number of bishops and no less than seven Patriarchs.</p>
<p>At some point after the death of Hārūn al-Rashīd in 809, perhaps ca. 811, Qenneshre was plundered and burned by a band of Arabs probably associated with the rebel leader Naṣr b. Shabath al-ʿUqaylī. Around 820, Patriarch <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> (himself, a product of the monastery) obtained permission from ʿUthmān b. Thumāma to rebuild it. Ibn al-ʿAdīm’s (d. 1262) <i>Bughyat al-ṭalab fī ta</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>rīkh</i> <i>Ḥalab</i> contains a brief anecdote related to Qenneshre, the contents of which suggest that the monastery was a popular spot for visitation and revelry for people from Mabbug into the reign of Sayf al-Dawla (d. 967). At some point in the Middle Ages, perhaps the mid-13th cent., Qenneshre ceased to be inhabited.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Spanish archaeologists conducting rescue operations in the Tishrin Dam area in northern Syria identified a large monastic site near the confluence of the Sayūr and Euphrates Rivers as being the location of Qenneshre. In late 2005 and early 2006, however, Syrian archaeologist Yousef al-Dabte conducted excavations at a site on the eastern shore of the Euphrates, directly across from the modern Syrian town of Jarablus (Jirbās) and identified it as Qenneshre. The results of al-Dabte’s one season of work remain only partially published, but for a variety of reasons, al-Dabte’s site is more likely to be that of the actual Qenneshre. Planned publication of analyses of pottery and inscriptions already found offer the prospect of much new information about the history of the monastery. At present, further excavations at the site are intended but contingent upon funding.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Quryaqos</head><ab type="infobox"/>Kyriakos (d. 817) [Syr. Orth.]
<p>Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, ordained on 17 Aug. 793 in <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>, died in June or August 817 in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> (the sources are not unanimous); he came from <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref>; before becoming Patr. he had been a monk in the Monastery of Esṭona near Kallinikos.</p>
<p>At a synod in the Monastery of Naphshatha on 7 Sept. 797, by a christological formula acceptable for both parts, he managed to achieve a church union with the Julianist Patriarch Gabriel, to the effect that if the latter survived Quryaqos, he would become Patr. for the united Syr. Orth. Church (‘Chronicle to the year 813’; <i>Chronica minora</i>252/191). The planned union did not come into being as some of the Severian bishops would not accept it and even accused the patr. of becoming a Julianist heretic.</p>
<p>Quryaqos tried to take decisive steps against the eucharistic formula (said to be of Nestorian tendency) ‘Panem caelestem frangimus’, which for a long time had been causing much dissension in the Church, but because of the danger of a schism was tolerated by the previous patriarchs. Quryaqos’s solution (at a synod in Beth Bathin in 795) did not bring the controversy to its end. On the contrary it brought about an open schism, as all other dissidents united with the party of the followers of the formula. The center of the opposition was the monastery of Gubba Barraya and the diocese of Cyrrhus, the bp. of which had been deposed by Quryaqos. At the synod summoned in 807/8 in Gubrin the dissenting bishops were deposed. Then they elected a monk of Qarṭmin, Abraham, an anti-patriarch. He sought recognition by the Coptic Patr. Markos, but due to Quryaqos’s intervention was excommunicated by Markos. This, however, did not put an end to the schism and it existed over the whole period of Quryaqos’s pontificate. One of the results of the machinations of the dissidents was that Caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd gave orders to destroy churches in the region of Tagra.</p>
<p>In some cases Quryaqos seems to have supported hierarchs who were disliked by their congregations. Such was the case with Shemʿon, the metropolitan of Tagrit (only the death of whom brought peace to the diocese) and with Basilios, his successor. The latter soon fell into a conflict with the people of Mosul, as he opposed their choice of Daniel, of the powerful <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>, as their bp. Quryaqos who supported the authority of Basilios (as the metropolitan of Tagrit, the position later known as maphrianate), formally had precedence over other metropolitans of the ‘East’ (i.e. the part of the Syr. Orth. Church on the former territory of the Persian [Sasanian] state). Quryaqos tried to solve the conflict by a conciliatory decree (<ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, Chronicle, 495f/IIIb,33–35).</p>
<p>In the atmosphere of conflicts within the church’s hierarchy the discipline among the priests and monks diminished. Quryaqos tried to improve that by instituting canons at two synods: in Beth Bathin near Ḥarran in November 794 (46 canons) and in Ḥarran in 812/13 (26 can.).</p>
<p>His literary works include responsa, a liturgy (anaphora), a collection of <i>memre</i> on theological themes (incomplete), a biography of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> (discovered by A. Vööbus), letters (three of which are quoted by Michael Rabo) and a synodal letter to the Coptic Patriarch Markos being a profession of faith (preserved in Arabic translation).</p>

<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>(411/2–435/6). Born into an aristocratic family in Qenneshrin (Chalcis), son of a pagan father and a Christian mother, Rabbula converted to Christianity as an adult, leaving his mother, wife, and children for the monastic life. Before long, he was elected Bp. of Edessa, where he became one of the great church leaders of his time. A fierce advocate for <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref> in the emerging Christological debates, Rabbula was said to have campaigned violently against pagans, ‘heretics’, and Jews, and to have destroyed four temples and a synagogue. Rabbula was also renowned for his work among the poor, for building hospitals, for regulating clergy, monastics, and members of the Covenant (<ref type="cr">Bnay qyāmā</ref>) with extensive legislation; for promoting a revised translation of the New Testament, and for composing numerous hymns. His extant writings are few, and some of dubious authenticity: several collections of rules governing church order, a sermon he delivered in Constantinople (in Syriac translation), a few letters including correspondence with Cyril, and various hymns. There is a magnificent hagiography in his honor.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Syriac ms. (now Florence, Bibl. Mediceo-Laurenziana, Pluteus I,56) containing the four Gospels, preceded by an important set of illuminations (f. 1r–14v). A colophon (f. 292r–v) provides the name of the scribe, Rabbula (who is otherwise unknown), and of those who contributed to the production of the ms. (the miniaturists are not named), as well as the date (Febr. 586) and the place of origin: the Monastery of Beth Mar Yuḥanon of Beth Zagba. This monastery, no longer in existence, was probably situated in the Djebel Riḥa, some 50 km. north of <ref type="cr">Apamea</ref>, in Syria (see Mundell Mango 1983).</p>
<p>While this ms. ranks among the earliest dated mss. of the Four Gospels (see <ref type="cr">Bible, NT manuscripts</ref>, under  3), it is even more famous for its illuminations. It opens with three full-page illuminations (f. 1r–2r): the selection of Matthias, the Virgin and Child (of the <i>Hodegetria</i> type), and standing figures of Ammonius of Alexandria and <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Ceasarea</ref>. F. 2v–3r show the text, written inside two nicely decorated frames, of Eusebius’s ‘Letter to Carpianus’ concerning the use of the Eusebian ‘canons’, i.e. synoptic tables listing the parallel passages in the four Gospels. The canons themselves follow on f. 3v–12v. They are integrated in architectural structures, in which the lists of text references are separated by pillars. These are roofed with arches, on top of which a variety of birds and plants are depicted. The canons are followed by four more full-page illuminations (f. 13r–14v): the Crucifixion with Resurrection, the Ascension, Christ enthroned and approached by four men (two of them holding each a book and two others following behind their brothers and supporting them), and Pentecost. The text of the Gospels itself (f. 20–291) does not contain any further illuminations.</p>
<p>The disposition and decoration of the Eusebian canons are of a common type, found in both the East and West. Their further elaboration, however, with additional themes and motifs, reveals the specific Syriac context of this ms. Folios 3v–9r have in the upper register (to the right and left of the arches) OT figures, accompanied by their names in Esṭrangela script: Aaron, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Solomon, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Zephaniah, Job, Isaiah, Habakkuk, Haggai, Zechariah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Malachi, and Elisha. In the middle register (to the right and left halfway of the outer pillars) NT scenes are depicted, while the right and left corners at the bottom are mostly filled with animals and plants. Some of the representations, such as the scenes of Christ’s Nativity and Baptism (with fire coming out of the water) and the impressive compositions of the Crucifixion (with Christ wearing the purple <i>kolobion</i>) and the Resurrection (with Christ appearing to the two Maries) reflect their Syriac context and are reminiscent of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>’s hymns and other Syriac writings.</p>
<p>The ms. in all likelihood originated in a Syr. Orth. environment and subsequently came into the possession of the Maronites. For at least two centuries it was housed in the Maronite Monastery of Qannubin, in Lebanon, before it was transferred to the Florentine library in the 16th cent.</p>
<p>There has been much discussion among scholars about the question of whether the quire with the illuminations (f. 1–14) and the main part containing the Gospel texts originally belonged together. While D. H. Wright in 1973, after personal inspection of the ms., reached the conclusion that the illuminations were indeed part of the codex that was created in 586, the recent study by P. G. Borbone and A. Mengozzi (in Bernabò, 2008) has challenged this widely held view. They point to a <ref type="cr">Gar­shuni</ref> note on f. 11v (written between the pillars of the canons) which records a significant (judging from the size and formal character of the note) donation by two priests to the Monastery of Qannubin in 1460/61. The object of the donation is described in the note as <i>al-dast al-kabīr</i> ‘the great <i>dast</i>’. S. E. Assemani, in his first description of the ms. (1742) understood the term <i>dast</i> to mean ‘copper vessel’, while Borbone and Mengozzi argue that it means ‘fascicle, quire’, and see in it a reference to the impressive gathering of illuminations which, according to their view, would have been joined to the Gospel text only in the 15th cent. This interpretation, which has not yet encountered general support (see Mundell Mango, in Bernabò 2008, 113–14), does not imply that the illuminations are of a very late date. On the contrary, the early date of most of the illuminations (probably 6th cent.) should not be questioned and is supported by the Syriac script found on these folios. We would be dealing then with the re-use of an early quire of illuminations that had become disconnected from its original manuscript.</p>
<p>Even while this and other questions continue to exist, the codex is one of the most precious illuminated mss. of the ancient world. Sharing so many characteristics with late-ancient and early Byzantine art, it also reflects the very refined local culture that existed in the leading Syriac monasteries. In recent years the illuminations have not only been studied intensively, they also have served as a source of inspiration for modern sacred art, especially in contemporary wall paintings in Maron., Syr. Orth., and Syr. Catholic churches.</p>

[Syr. Cath.]
<p>Patr. (1898–1929), scholar, and liturgist. He was born in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> on 7 Nov. 1848 and named Louis. He studied at the Dominican School under <ref type="cr">Clemens Joseph David</ref> and in 1863 was sent to study in Rome, where he was ordained in 1873. On his return to Mosul he helped in editorial tasks at the Dominican Press. In 1880 he became a Chorepiscopos, and in 1887 was consecrated by Ignatius Giwargis V as titular bp. of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, with the name Rabbula Ephrem. He organized the seventh Synod of <ref type="cr">Sharfeh</ref>, and in 1890 became bp. of <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>, and then of <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> in 1894. Following his election as Patr. in 1898 he renovated the Sharfeh press, moved the patriarchate from <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> to <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>, founded the seminary school in <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> (1902), and restored <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Behnam</ref>. His most important publications of Syriac were the <ref type="cr">Testament of our Lord Jesus Christ</ref> (1899, with LT), Martyrdom of Shmona and Gurya (1899, with LT), the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of 1234</ref> (1904), <i>Studia</i> <i>Syriaca</i>, I–V (1904–9; the last volume containing <ref type="cr">Anṭun of Tagrit</ref>’s book on poetics), and <i>Ktobo d-ṭekso d-qurobo  / Missale</i> (1922). His <i>Les liturgies orientales et occidentales</i> (1934, in Arabic) was a pioneering study of comparative liturgy.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock and G. A. Kiraz</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Renaissance, Syriac
</LemmaTitle><p>A term probably first used by <ref type="cr">A. Baumstark</ref> to denote a period in Syriac literature (11th–13th cent.) of great productivity, characterized by a growing acceptance of Arabic science and of Arabic and Muslim cultural and religious patterns. Examples include translations/adaptations of Arabic scientific works, the introduction of rhymed and rhythmic prose <i>(saj</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʿ, for instance, by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>) as well as Arabic verse meters (<i>rajaz</i>,<i> ṭawīl</i>), a new explanation of Syriac grammar based on theories borrowed from Arabic grammarians (<ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb bar Malkon</ref>), and the creation of new literary genres (e.g., wine poetry, <i>khamriyyāt</i>). In the field of historiography, one witnesses an increasing use of Muslim sources in Persian and Arabic. The same applies to philosophy, where the study of authors like Ibn Sinā, Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī, Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī, and Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī contributed to new developments, e.g., in the works of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref>, Bar Malkon, and Bar ʿEbroyo. This Muslim influence can be felt even in the domains of theology, spirituality, and canon law. Some modern authors such as <ref type="cr">J.-B. Chabot</ref> have a negative appreciation of this period on account of the loss of original Syriac themes, styles, and patterns.</p>
<p>A second characteristic of the Syriac Renaissance seems to be a certain awareness (not shared by all authors belonging to this period) that the traditional Christological differences between Chalcedonians and E.-Syrians and W.-Syrians were a matter of terminology rather than of substance. This development also explains the good contacts with European Christians through the Crusader presence in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The idea of a Renaissance has also been used by scholars in the fields of architecture and visual arts, which in the same period were characterized by a greater openness to Islamic styles and to influences from the European (Crusaders) and Byzantine world.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Reshʿayna</head><ab type="infobox"/>Theodosiopolis <LemmaTitle>
</LemmaTitle><p>City on the Khabur, located in the eastern part of ancient Osrhoene and today straddling the Turkish-Syrian border, the Syrian part now bearing the name <i>Ra</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>s al-ʿAyn</i> and the Turkish part <i>Ceylanpınar</i> (earlier Resülayn). Its Syriac and Arabic names, meaning ‘spring-head’ in both cases, refer to the large number of springs in the area, from which the Khabur draws much of its water. The biblical city of Resen (Gen. 10:12; Pesh.: Rasan) was identified with Reshʿayna by <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> (Commentary on Genesis, ed. R. M. Tonneau [CSCO 152], 65.25–6) and in the later Syr. exegetical tradition (as well as in the Palestinian Targumim). In classical times it was also known as Theodosiopolis after Emperor Theodosius I (379–95), who according to the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Edessa</ref> ‘founded’ the city in 380/1 (ed. Guidi, 5.17–8) and according to Malalas granted it municipal status in 383. The city, which was taken by the Arabs in 640, saw brief occupations by the Byzantines in 943 and by the Franks under Count Joscelin I of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> in around 1129. It fell into insignificance in the modern period, so that the present-day twin city of Raʾs al-ʿAyn-Ceylanpınar is largely a modern foundation created in the late 19th cent.</p>
<p>Among the early bishops of Reshʿayna mention may be made of Andrew, banished for his opposition to the ‘Henoticon’ in 484, Peṭros, a correspondent of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> who was exiled by Justin I in 519, and ʾSWL (Asylios/Ascholios?), whom <ref type="cr">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref> denounced before the Chalcedonian Patr. Ephrem of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> in ca. 535. After the Islamic conquest, we hear of the Syr. Orth. bp. Gabriel in 667. The synod at which <ref type="cr">Athanasios II of</ref> <ref type="cr">Balad</ref> was elected Patr. was held in Reshʿayna in 684. The names of nine bishops of Reshʿayna between 724 and 986 are known from the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael I Rabo</ref>. In the 11th and early 
12th cent. the see of Reshʿayna is usually found united with that of <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>.</p>
<p>Among the E.-Syr. authors mentioned by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> are Daniel of Reshʿayna (ca. 550) (Assemani, <i>Bib. Or.</i> III/1, 223) and <ref type="cr">Shalliṭa of Reshʿayna</ref>, the latter of whom is said in mss. of his work to have been a bp. Reshʿayna is mentioned as a suffragan of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> in a list of E.-Syr. dioceses in 1007/8.</p>
<p>An important monastery in the neighbourhood of Reshʿayna is known under different names: 1. <i>Speqlis</i>/<cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>Espeqlis</i>, i.e., ‘Specula’ or ‘Watchtower’ (mss. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,430 and 12,135[I], two biblical mss., written in 724 and 726 respectively, by the scribe Sobho of Reshʿayna, ‘who never made a blotted <i>taw</i>’; see Wright, <i>Catalogue</i>, vol. I, 15b–16b and 24b–26a; comp.<i> ibid.</i>, 9a–10a); 
2. Asphulos/Asphuloye/Saphylos (Michael Rabo); and 
3. Pgimto (<ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, ‘Chron. Eccl.’, ed. Abbeloos and Lamy, I.281: <i>Dayro da-Pgimto</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>awkit d-SPWLWS</i>, which is mentioned here as the monastery of origin of Patr. <ref type="cr">Severos bar Mashqo</ref>). Barsoum claims that it was built in the 5th cent. and reduced to ruins shortly before 1203, and that it produced two patriarchs and eleven bishops.</p>
<p>Two monks who are regularly quoted in the margin of <ref type="cr">Masora</ref> mss., Ṭubhono and Sobho, may have belonged to the nearby <ref type="cr">Monastery of Qarqaphto</ref>. Their fame also spread to the Ch. of E., as <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref> mentions them in his Lexicon (ed. R. Duval, 1363–4), specifically linking them to Reshʿayna and crediting them with an important role in the ‘tradition (<i>mašlmonutho</i>) of the (two) Testaments’. Whether this monk Sobho (whom Bar Bahlul also calls Sanṭo) might be the same as the early–8th-cent. Sobho of the ‘Watchtower’, mentioned above, remains an open question (Loopstra argues for their identity).</p>
<p>On the stretch of the Khabur between Reshʿayna and Hassaka to the south are thirty-seven villages settled by refugees from the <ref type="cr">Hakkari</ref> region, mostly members of the Ch. of E., who arrived here via Iraq in 1930’s.</p>

Yoḥannan bar Qushta (1841–1921)
<p>French Dominican missionary, scholar, writer and poet in <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref>. Rhétoré entered the Dominican order in 1861, and he was ordained a priest in 1866. After having been master of the novices in Mazères (France) and having been in charge of the monastery of Corbara in Corsica, he was sent to the mission of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> in 1874. Between 1874 and 1879 he lived in Mar Yaʿqo, near Dehok, and then for two years in Mosul. In 1881 he joined the newly-founded mission of Van, from where he often visited the <ref type="cr">Assyrians</ref> dwelling in the mountains between Van and Mosul. He stayed in Van until 1908, but was absent between 1894 and 1897, to take up an appointment as lecturer in Chaldean and Armenian at the École biblique et archéologique française de Jérusalem, and in 1897–98, for a short visit home to France. Between 1908 and 1911 he lived in the village of Ashitha, in the <ref type="cr">Hakkari</ref> mountains. Back in Mosul, during the First World War, Rhétoré was taken hostage by the Ottomans and interned in <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> and Konia. He witnessed and carefully recorded the persecutions and massacres of Christians in 1915 in his <i>Les chrétiens aux bêtes</i>. In 1918 he stayed in Constantinople and two years later went back to Mosul, where he died on 12 March 1921.</p>
<p>Rhétoré regularly published letters and articles in a number of missionary periodicals. He also collected, copied, and wrote mss. in <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref>, wrote grammars of <ref type="cr">Ṭuroyo</ref>, Sureth, and Armenian, and an essay on Sureth poetry. Most of this valuable material is unpublished. Like the missionaries in <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref>, he contributed to the emergence of a literary written form of the Neo-Aramaic vernacular of the Mosul region. He opted for moderately classicized spelling and vocabulary. More prescriptive than descriptive, his <i>Grammaire de la langue Soureth</i>is nevertheless a precious source for the knowledge of the Neo-Aramaic varieties spoken in the Mosul plain and in the Hakkari region.</p>
<p>In Sureth Rhétoré composed fables in verse, songs, and poems, sometimes with the assistance of the famous native poet David Kora (<ref type="cr">School of Alqosh</ref>). Rhétoré studied the traditional <ref type="cr">Dorekthā</ref> genre and himself composed a number of hymns, under the pseudonym Yaʿqo Nukhraya ‘Jacques l’Étranger’. In 1896, during his stay abroad, some of these texts were edited rather unsatisfactorily under the name of David Kora (‘Daoud l’Aveugle’) and were included in two collections of the Dominican Press. In the last years of his life, Rhétoré composed a <i>Dorekthā</i>‘On the sufferings of the Christians under the Sultan Reshad’, with historical notes and commentary, using the pseudonym of Yuḥannan bar Qushta.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Rhetoric 
</LemmaTitle><p>In the widest sense a term designating the artistic use of language, primarily in speech but secondarily in writing, with the purpose of influencing the hearers or readers. As such rhetoric has arisen in civilizations and languages the world over, and in Syriac the most notable extant rhetoric may be thought to be the poetry of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, which, through the artistic use of the Syriac language, was designed to persuade the hearers to adhere to his vision of the Christian faith and to dissuade them from the ways of his opponents. Within the sphere of European and Near Eastern civilization, however, ‘rhetoric’ often serves as a short designation for what may be more precisely termed ‘classical rhetoric’, the theory of discourse, applied both to speaking and writing, developed in ancient Greece and Rome. This theory or technique was presented in treatises and manuals in Greek and Latin, and became, both at elementary and higher levels, a principal component of the educational system of classical and late antiquity. With the influence of Greek culture in the Syriac-speaking area, classical rhetoric became familiar to Syrians and exercised an influence also on Syriac literature, and in this sense the term <i>rhiṭuriqe</i> (or similar) and its cognates are employed in Syriac, from the Greek (<i>technē</i>) <i>rhētorikē</i>. <ref type="cr">John bar Aphtonia</ref>, founder of the famous <ref type="cr">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref>, was born in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> of a father who, according to a Syriac panegyric of John, ‘partook of secular wisdom, as not without foresight it ends up with the art of rhetoric (<i>ummānu</i><i>thā d-rhiṭruthā</i>)’.</p>
<p>Classical rhetoric categorized discourse as forensic (judgement on the past), deliberative (advice for the future), or epideictic (praise or blame), and examples of each may be found in Syriac literature. The oration of <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref> on the three E.-Syr. teachers has been analysed as a speech of defence structured according to the precepts of forensic rhetoric, and the <ref type="cr">Book of Steps</ref> as a set of exhortations patterned after the principles of deliberative rhetoric. The clearest examples of the influence of classical rhetoric in Syriac, however, fall within the realm of epideictic: an anonymous speech in praise of John bar Aphtonia, an oration on <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> by <ref type="cr">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>, and an oration on <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> by <ref type="cr">Eli of Qarṭmin</ref>.</p>
<p>The ‘Book of Dialogues’ of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref> is evidence that even as late as the 13th cent. Syriac scholars accorded rhetoric a place in their curriculum of ‘secular wisdom’ consistent with the position it held in late antiquity, for Book One of this treatise has four sections devoted to grammar, rhetoric, poetics, and the copiousness of the Syriac language, Book Two being devoted to logic and philosophy. Most of the sections on rhetoric and poetics are derived from the single extant treatise in Syriac devoted entirely to rhetoric, that by <ref type="cr">Anṭun of Tagrit</ref>. This lengthy treatise (in five Books) exhibits several points of contact with classical rhetorical theory, but also some significant differences. While naming <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, whose orations he knew in Syriac translation, ‘the prince of rhetors’, Anṭun equally admired the ‘ornamentation of words’ (the subject of Book Five) produced by Ephrem.</p>
<p>The ‘Rhetoric’ of <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>, in modern times the most widely admired treatise of Greek rhetoric, was not as influential in late antiquity as the works of other Greek writers on rhetoric. It was, however, included by late antique Alexandrian philosophers in the Organon, the set of treatises by Aristotle devoted to logic. Like other treatises of the Organon, it was rendered into Syriac. The Syriac version is lost, but was probably the basis for the ‘old’ (i.e. prior to <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref>) Arabic version, which is extant and was the subject of commentaries by Islamic philosophers. The Syriac version was the subject of a commentary by <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> in his ‘Cream of Wisdom’, although Bar ʿEbroyo also made much use of the Arabic commentary by Avicenna on the old Arabic version.</p>

<Author>J. W. Watt</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Romanos the Melodist</head><ab type="infobox"/>(ca. 485 – ca. 560)
<p>Byzantine hymnographer and deacon. Born in <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ (Emesa)</ref>, Romanos earned the surname ‘the Melodist’ by composing hymns in Greek which, for the last 1,500 years, have been regarded as masterpieces. Although he is sometimes credited with developing a new Greek poetic form, the <i>kontakion</i>, it is more accurate to call him the perfector of this genre: his hymns are the most perfect examples of this form, whose invention antedates him. The <i>kontakion</i> is credited with introducing the ‘accent’ (or ‘Byzantine’) metric into Greek poetry (contrasted with the earlier ‘quantitative’ or ‘Hellenic’ metric). Romanos’s <i>kontakia</i> have also been singled out as the first examples of chancel drama, and the predecessor of the medieval mystery and passion plays. Romanos’s hymns are rhetorically elegant, theologically sophisticated, aesthetically sublime, and psychologically profound; Karl Krumbacher termed him ‘the greatest Church poet of all time’.</p>
<p>Little is known of Romanos’s life. The liturgical ‘Menaia’ and ‘Synaxaria’ of the Byzantine Orthodox Church are our sole sources. They state that he was born in Emesa and was ‘of the Hebrew race’. He became a deacon in <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>, and then moved to Constantinople during the reign of Anastasius I (r. 491–518). There he lived in the ‘temple’ of the Theotokos in the Kuros. It is reported that in his sleep the night before the Feast of the Nativity, Mary appeared to him in a vision and gave him a scroll to eat. He then awoke, ascended into the pulpit, and began to sing one of his most beautiful and subsequently well-known <i>kontakia</i>: ‘Today the Virgin gives birth to the super-essential one’. Famed during his own life for his popular hymns, he is reported to have composed about a thousand <i>kontakia</i>, although only 59 have been preserved. (Another 29 <i>kontakia</i> have been attributed to Romanos, but Maas and Trypanis correctly reject them. The <i>Akathistos</i> hymn of the Orthodox Church has sometimes been attributed to him, although without convincing evidence.) Because Romanos references the destruction of Constantinople by earthquakes and subsequent fires, his death must be placed after 552 or possibly 555, for in those years earthquakes devastated Constantinople.</p>
<p>From an historical and textual standpoint, Romanos’s hymns are significant for four reasons. 1. They are a window into the layperson’s mind at the time of Justinian, for Romanos was writing for the common person. The hymns are not the high theology argued between bishops, vying for political advantage. Rather, the hymns are pastoral works, addressing the concerns of the average person and communicating the mysteries of the faith in a form understandable to the laity. 
2. Romanos’s hymns provide strong evidence for a link between Syr. Christian culture and the Greek, Byzantine world. Romanos’s dependence — both literary and structural  — upon the Syriac <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> is demonstrable. Both his literary corpus and the account of his childhood in Syria suggest that Romanos was bilingual: his scansions often require that Semitic names be scanned as in Hebrew or Syriac. Romanos’s hymns often address the same themes as Ephrem’s, and sometimes both share the same illustration, metaphor, or even turn of phrase. Indeed, the form of the Syriac <i>madrāšā</i> (stanzas, a refrain, an acrostic, with rhyme) closely parallels that of the <i>kontakion</i>. Other forms used by Ephrem’s Syriac hymns and sermons (the <i>memrā</i>, which is a metrical sermon, and the <i>soghithā</i>, which has a dramatic, epic element, and which often uses dialogue in a free recreation of a biblical episode) find their distinctive characteristics transplanted into the Greek world in the <i>kontakia</i> of Romanos. As a literary form, the <i>kontakion</i> was clearly derived from Semitic (specifically, Syriac) poetic forms. And the Syriac corpus of Ephrem was clearly Romanos’s model for his Greek hymns. 3. Romanos’s Greek hymns furthermore betray his dependence on Syriac literary sources. His appropriation of Ephrem has been discussed; but he also used Syriac biblical texts, sometimes verbatim. He often quotes the Gospels in the form of <ref type="cr">Tatian</ref>’s <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref>, or in forms found only in Syriac sources (e.g. in the <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Version</ref> of the NT). This further underscores his dependence on Syriac sources. 4. Romanos’s hymns occasionally contain ancient Judaeo-Christian traditions from what later became ‘extra-canonical’ Gospels. An example is the ‘light’ (or ‘fire’) in the Jordan River at Jesus’s baptism (also in the ‘Gospel according to the Hebrews’); another is that, on the night Jesus was arrested, Peter weeps at the door of the High Priest’s house <i>before</i> denying Jesus (when Peter hears the cock crow and then weeps, that is his <i>second</i> episode of weeping) (so also the ‘Gospel of the Nazoraeans’).</p>

<p>Cath. (596–604). He originated from <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref> and was born ca. 525. He lived as a shepherd before his village priest saw his ability and started teaching him. Sabrishoʿ then went on to the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>, after which he lived an ascetic life in the region of Qardu and elsewhere. He was appointed bp. of Lashom some time after 576, and undertook a number of missionary journeys, during one of which he was involved in the conversion of Nuʿman III of <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref>. Shortly after his appointment as Cath. in 596 (at the orders of Khusrau II) he convened a synod to deal with various doctrinal and other abuses. The acts of the synod contain a preamble which includes a statement of faith, an agreement dated 598 made by three monasteries in the Sinjar region (whose monks are described as “of Bar Qaiti”), and a Letter by Sabrishoʿ to the same monks. The <i>teš</i><i>boḥtā Abun dba-šmayyā qaddiš ba-kyāneh</i>is attributed to Sabrishoʿ in some sources (but to <ref type="cr">Babai</ref> or <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb II</ref> in others).</p>
<p>The Life of Sabrishoʿ by his friend ‘Petros the solitary’ is much concerned with his miracles (published in Bedjan, <i>Histoire de Mar-Jabalaha, de trois autres patriarches</i>..., 288–331); the notices about him in the Chronicle of<ref type="cr">

</head><ab type="infobox"/>Sabrishoʿ of Mosul (late 12th cent.) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>Author of a hymn for Mid-Lent, preserved in the <i>Ktābā d-Wardā</i> (see <ref type="cr">Gewargis Warda</ref>) and published by Cardahi. The author is called <i>Mawṣlāyā</i> ‘from <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>’, and in the subscription of one ms. it is reported that he was a teacher in the Monastery of Mar Michael in Mosul in 1188/89. His significance as a liturgical poet may have extended far beyond the one hymn that is known, as the name of ‘Sabrishoʿ of Mosul’ is remembered in a 20th-cent. <ref type="cr">dorekthā</ref> by Thomas Hanna of <ref type="cr">Karamlish</ref> (ed. by E. Braida, forthcoming in A. Mengozzi, <i>Religious poetry in vernacular Syriac from Northern Iraq</i>, CSCO 627–628).</p>
<p>In addition, an author by the name of Sabrishoʿ d-Pawlos (‘of Pawlos’, or perhaps ‘who [is] Pawlos’, rather than ‘son of Pawlos’) is mentioned among ‘the orthodox teachers’ in a list that is found in some E.-Syr. mss. (see, e.g., Vandenhoff; comp. Van den Eynde, XXV, Document VIII). While it first seemed reasonable to assume that this is the same person, Reinink argued against their identity, because Sabrishoʿ d-Pawlos happens to be quoted in the <ref type="cr">Gannat Bussāme</ref> within a passage that is attributed to the 9th-cent. author <ref type="cr">Ṣharbokht</ref>. This would require a significantly earlier date for this second Sabrishoʿ. Regardless of what his relationship to Sabrishoʿ bar Pawlos is, no further information on Sabrishoʿ 
d-Pawlos is available.</p>
<p>Finally, Scher proposed, albeit only tentatively, that Sabrishoʿ bar Pawlos is to be identified as the author of an anonymous commentary on the Bible, preserved in mss. Mosul 1–3 (dated 1701), parts of which exist in several other mss. (Scher, 228). Although Baumstark gave some additional weight to this proposal, by reiterating it (without, however, explicitly endorsing it), no positive evidence in its support can be provided. At least some parts of this anonymous commentary must belong to an earlier period, and Sabrishoʿ’s authorship is highly unlikely.</p>

<p>German scholar of Arabic, Aramaic, and Syriac. Born on 20 July 1845 in Neumünster, Schleswig-Holstein, Sachau began studying Near-Eastern languages at Kiel and Leipzig in 1863. After receiving his Ph.D. degree in 1867, he studied in Oxford and London. In 1869, he was appointed professor of Semitic languages in Vienna; beginning in 1876, he was professor of Near-Eastern literature in Berlin. In addition, between 1887 and 1920, he was the first director of the Seminar for Oriental Languages in Berlin, which provided language training to public officers in the East, even though he himself did not teach there. To prepare them for their interaction with the Muslim inhabitants of the newly acquired German colonies in East Africa, he wrote his <i>Muhammedanisches Recht nach schafiitischer Lehre</i> (3rd ed. 1897). In 1878–79, he traveled on behalf of the Prussian government to Syria and Mesopotamia, where he was able to acquire many Syriac mss. for the library of Berlin. Sachau himself described these mss., along with the previously acquired mss. in Berlin, in a comprehensive catalogue published in 1899. He returned to the Middle East in 1897–98. He wrote extensive and very readable reports describing both of his trips to the Middle East. The main fields of his scholarly interest included Arabic, Syriac, the epigraphy of earlier dialects of Aramaic, and Neo-Aramaic. In addition to Arabic works (by al-Jawāliqī, al-Bīrūnī, and Ibn Saʿd), he edited a number of Syriac sources, including several recensions of the Syro-Roman Lawbook (1880 [Syriac, Armenian, Arabic], 1907) as well as lawbooks of E.-Syr. patriarchs and bishops (1907–14). In his capacity as professor at Berlin University and well-connected to the German authorities, he was among the leading German scholars of Near-Eastern Studies of his day, even though personally he was not highly esteemed by all of his academic colleagues. He died in Berlin, Charlottenburg on 17 Sept. 1930.</p>

<p>Monastic author. He was born in Halmon (<ref type="cr">Beth Nuhadra</ref>) and took up a monastic vocation under the influence of his mother and a saintly woman, Shirin. He lived as a monk of the <ref type="cr">Monastery of</ref> <ref type="cr">Beth ʿAbe</ref> until some time between 635 and 640, when he was made bp. of <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>. His views on christology were seen to be too Chalcedonian, and he was deposed at a synod. For a while he was re-instated, but then was again deposed. His fine ‘Book of Perfection’ is preserved, not quite complete, in a ms. copied in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> in 837. The work is in two parts; the first begins with the dogmatic foundations of the moral life of Christians (only parts of this are preserved), and then goes on to provide an introduction to the life of perfection, both coenobitic and solitary. The second part is devoted to discussion of the different virtues. A remarkable feature of the work is the very large number of biblical quotations and allusions (and very few references to non-biblical literature). Five Letters and a set of maxims on Wisdom also survive.</p>

<p>Professor of Arabic and Syriac in Rome, Venice, and Paris. Syriac scholar. Born in Ehden, Lebanon, al-Ṣahyūnī was sent to Rome in 1584, to study at the Maronite College. After his studies he taught Arabic and Syriac, first at the College Sapienza in Rome and later in Venice. In 1614 he traveled to Paris, in the company of Yūḥannā al-Ḥaṣrūnī, where he became professor of Arabic at the Collège Royal (the later Collège de France). In addition to Arabic, al-Ṣahyūnī also taught Syriac (‘la langue chaldaïque’), albeit on a more informal basis. Along with two other Maronite scholars, Yuḥanna al-Ḥaṣrūnī and <ref type="cr">Ibrāhīm al-Ḥāqilānī</ref>, al-Ṣahyūnī was deeply involved in the preparation of the Paris Polyglot Bible, which was printed between 1628 and 1645. In contrast to the Antwerp Polyglot (1569–72), in which <ref type="cr">Andreas Masius</ref>had been involved, the Paris Polyglot included a full text of the Syriac OT and NT in the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>version. The Peshitta NT, which had previously been published by J. A. Widmanstetter (1555), was supplemented with the four minor Catholic Epistles (the ‘Pococke’ epistles) and with the Apocalypse in the <ref type="cr">Ḥarqlean Version</ref>. Al-Ṣahyūnī was in charge of the final editing of most of the Syriac and the Arabic, and provided the larger part of the accompanying Latin translation of the Syriac texts. The Syr. text of the Paris Polyglot served as the basis for the London Polyglot, which was edited by Brian Walton (1655–57).</p>
<p>In the course of his work, al-Ṣahyūnī came into conflict with G.-M. Le Jay, the general editor of the Polyglot (which landed al-Ṣahyūnī in a Paris prison for three months in 1640) as well as with al-Ḥāqilānī.</p>
<p>In addition to his work for the Paris Polyglot, al-Ṣahyūnī published a Syriac life of St. <ref type="cr">Maron</ref>, which was included in the 1608 edition of the Maronite Missal; a 1625 edition and Latin translation of the Syr. Psalms; and an edition with LT of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s poem on the divine wisdom (1628). He is also known as the copyist of Syr. mss. Paris, Bibl.

Monastery of the Cross [Syr. Orth.]
<p>Monastery and village in <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>. Dayr al-Ṣalīb, also called the Monastery of Beth El and located ca. 30 km. northeast of <ref type="cr">Midyat</ref> and 13 km. north of Ḥaḥ, is to be distinguished from another Monastery of the Cross in Defne/ʿAtafiyya near Ḥesno d-Kifo (Hasankeyf). The monastery derives its name from a piece of the Holy Cross obtained in Constantinople by Mor Aḥo of <ref type="cr">Resh</ref>ʿ<ref type="cr">ayna</ref> (6th cent.), whose tomb is found today in a separate chapel outside the main monastic complex. Within the main complex there is, besides the main church of the Holy Cross, a church of Mor Ḥworo (disciple and successor of Mor Aḥo) and Mor<ref type="cr"> Barṣawmo</ref>.</p>
<p>After the Syr. Orth. diocese of Ṭur ʿAbdin was divided into those of Qarṭmin and Ḥaḥ in 1088, the bishops of Ḥaḥ regularly resided at Dayr al-Ṣalīb. After the schism of 1364, Ḥaḥ and Dayro da-Ṣlibo continued as a bishopric under the patriarchate of Ṭur ʿAbdin. The last metropolitan of Dayr al-Ṣalīb, Antimus Yaʿqub of Esfes, was killed in 1915.</p>
<p>The monastic complex, which is said once to have housed 300 monks, provided refuge for those living in neighbouring villages and itself became a village in the 19th cent. In 1892, O. H. Parry found ‘about twenty Syrian families’ living within the monastery with ‘their flocks’. The village, with a reported population of 400 in 1914, suffered heavy losses during and after the First World War.

<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> (1947–48), and first bp. of the United States (1957–95). He was born in Ḥulwa near <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> in 1907, and lost his father at an early age. His mother took him to the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Mark</ref> in Jerusalem where they both lived, and where he later became a monk. In 1931 he was part of the entourage of Patr. <ref type="cr">Eliya III</ref> in a visit to India. He studied in Egypt and became editor of the <i>Patriarchal Magazine</i> (Jerusalem). He became an abbot of the monastery and in 1946 was consecrated bp. of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In 1947 he purchased from Arab bedouins through Iskandar Shahin (Kando), a Syriac antiquity dealer from Bethlehem, four Dead Sea Scrolls, later to be known as the St. Mark’s Scrolls. In 1948, he traveled with the Scrolls to the United States for the purpose of making the Scrolls available to a wider market. In the United States, the scrolls were displayed at various institutions, including the Library of Congress and Duke University. After some complications, the Scrolls were purchased by Y.  Yadin, through an intermediary, for the State of Israel.</p>
<p>In 1948 he was appointed Apostolic Legate to the United States, and in 1957 he became the first bp. of the United States and Canada. He was instrumental in the advancement of this new diocese. He is remembered by many parishioners for his humility and for the help that he rendered to new immigrants, sometimes even taking old ladies shopping for food in his car. In 1971 he took part in the consecration of the Coptic Pope Shenouda  III. In addition to his English autobiography (1966, AT 1985), he wrote a series of Syriac readers entitled <i>mhadyono dšarwoye l-lešono oromoyo</i>  / <i>Aramaic new method readers</i> (vols. 1–3, Jerusalem, 1937–45; vols. 4–6, Glanerbrug, 1984); critics, however, claim that <ref type="cr">Qarabashī</ref> may have had a hand in authoring them.

He was also a skillful scribe (many of the inscriptions in the United States are molded from his hand). He died in 1995 and was buried in the Monastery of St. Ephrem in The Netherlands according to his Last Will and Testament, which also stipulated that his substantial estate be used for educational purposes and the training of clergy, now administered by the Athanasius Yeshu Samuel Fund.</p>

<Author>H. G. B. Teule</Author><LemmaTitle>Sargis Bḥira</head><ab type="infobox"/> Sergios Baḥira
<p>Sargis Bḥira is the name of a Syriac monk who allegedly met the Prophet Muḥammad and inspired him to begin preaching to the Arabs. The earliest reference to this legendary figure is to be found in the E.-Syr. ‘Disputation of the Monk of Bet Ḥale with an Arab notable’, which is commonly dated to the early 8th  cent. In this religious dialogue the monk-protagonist asserts that the Qurʾānic teaching regarding the Word of God and his Spirit (cf. Qurʾān 4:171) is to be traced back to Sargis’s instruction of the Prophet. In the early 9th  cent., when the polemics between Muslims and Syriac-speaking Christians burgeoned, the rumors about this Christian tutor of the Prophet were spun out into the Syriac ‘Legend of Sargis’. This story relates how a monk received an apocalyptic vision on Mount Sinai about the imminent rise of Arab rule. In this vision, a sequence of theriomorphic appearances, interpreted by an angel, makes clear that the Umayyads fulfilled the prophecy of Gen 17:20 regarding the twelve princes of Ishmael, while the rule of the Abbasids is projected to end with Caliph al-Maʾmūn (r. 813–833). It is described how, after having received this apocalyptic vision, the monk begins to preach the veneration of one single cross, which leads to his persecution by local ecclesiastical authorities. Fleeing to the desert of Arabia, he meets Muḥammad and informs him that he is destined to become the leader of the Arabs. The monk also tells Muḥammad about his religion and instructs him in a simplified form of Christianity. He urges Muḥammad to convert the Arabs to the one true God and designs a number of religious rituals and precepts for them, which the monk eventually codifies in the Qurʾān. The legend ends with another prophecy about the political and social turmoil under the Abbasids, their final collapse, and the exclusive redemption of Christians at the end of time. This highly polemical tale, which claims that the Qurʾān was written by human hands, has strong apologetic overtones, inasmuch as it suggests that the historical Muḥammad was essentially supportive of Christianity and that he summoned Muslim leaders never to do harm to the Christian communities.</p>
<p>The legend survives in two Syriac redactions (E.-Syr. and W.-Syr.). Arguments have been presented by modern scholars as to which Syriac community composed the first version, none of which can be regarded as decisive. There are also two Arabic versions, which go into more detail about the supposed Qurʾānic echoes of Christian teachings.</p>
<p>In numerous Muslim biographies of the Prophet, including the early 9th-cent. redactions of <i>al-Sīra al-Nabawiyya</i> by Ibn Isḥāq, there are references to a monk who recognized Muḥammad, prior to his first revelation, as the awaited new Prophet. In these stories the monk is called only Baḥira, in contradistinction to the ‘Sargis Bḥira’ of the Syriac accounts. Several modern scholars have tried to find a link between the legendary stories about Muḥammad’s alleged teacher and historical figures called Sergios found in Syriac sources. Taking into consideration, however, that the Syriac legend is most probably a polemical adaptation of the Islamic stories, i.e. presupposing the primacy of the latter, it is likely that Syriac speakers provided this monk with a supplementary name. They may have added the name Sergios, because Baḥira was not commonly known as a proper name in Syriac. It is an epithet for someone ‘tested and approved’ by God, (i.e. ‘venerable’, or ‘eminent’).</p>
<p>The idea that Muḥammad was taught by a monk lives on among Eastern Christians. It has been perpetuated in a vast array of accounts with remarkably diverse interpretations of the monk’s supposed intentions and his role in the genesis of Islam.</p>

Following his election as Patr., he sent Ṣawma on a diplomatic mission to enlist the help of Christian Europe on behalf of Christians in the East. Ṣawma who had kept a journal, presumably in Persian, of his travels from China, continued to document his travels that took him to Constantinople, Rome, Paris, before returning to <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>. The record of the journey of the two monks to Baghdad, and of Ṣawma’s subsequent mission to Europe, provides a rich, eye-witness account of places, people, and events in the last half of the 13th cent.

<p>‘Sayfo’, or ‘the sword’, is the term now commonly used for the large-scale massacres of the Syriac (as well as the Armenian) inhabitants of eastern Turkey in 1915 and following years, in the course of World War I and its aftermath (another term also used is ‘Firman’, denoting the order to kill the Christian population; also ‘Seferberlik’ denoting mass deportations). Serious massacres had occurred at intervals in the 19th cent., notably in 1843 (<ref type="cr">Hakkari</ref>), 1860 (<ref type="cr">Damascus</ref> and Lebanon), and 1895–6 (eastern Turkey), but those of 1915 were evidently orchestrated by high Ottoman officials, in particular the Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha. In the area between Urfa (<ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>) and Cizre the massacres and deportations primarily affected the Syr. Orth., Syr. Cath. and Chaldeans. The Assyrians, to the east of Cizre, in the Hakkari region, having sided with the Russians in 1916, were abandoned after the Russian Revolution (1917), and were driven out by the Ottoman army, escaping to the <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref> region (northwest Iran). Subsequently, when Urmia fell, large numbers were massacred.</p>
<p>The losses to all the Syriac-speaking communities were enormous. Eight out of twenty Syr. Orth. dioceses were completely or largely wiped out, and whole areas that had formerly had a considerable Syriac presence, notably Bsheriyyeh (Syr. Orth. and Chaldean) and Hakkari (Ch. of E.), were totally depleted of their Christian population. Reliable figures for those killed or who died in the course of deportations are difficult to attain (see Gaunt, 300–303), but in any case for all the Syriac Churches in eastern Turkey, the losses of their people formerly living in that region were well over 50%, and in some cases as much as 90%.</p>
<p> Those who escaped the massacres fled south to Syria, Palestine, or Iraq, and in the case of the Assyrians, also Iran or north towards the Caucasus. Although the emigration of Middle Eastern Christians to the Americas had begun in the 19th cent., especially after the massacres of 1895/6, it was Sayfo that gave a huge impetus to the creation of a massive <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref> that today accounts for a large proportion of all Syriac Christians.</p>

Gabriel Adamo (1873–99) of Kirkuk after whose death Scher administered the diocese for one year. In 1900 he became the secretary of the next bp., Eliya Khayyāṭ. In 1902 he was consecrated bp. of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>. In 1908 he traveled to <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>, Constantinople, Rome, and Paris seeking funds to aid his poor diocese where he met a number of Syriac scholars. During World War I, the Ottoman Turks conspired to kill him, but he initially escaped with the aid of Kurds under Badr Khan. His escape resulted in a massacre where many Christians were killed. Finally, the Turkish army found him, tortured, and beheaded him on 15 June 1915. It is said that prior to his escape, he hid the manuscripts that he had in a well.</p>
<p>Scher published a number of important texts, with FT, in European series and periodicals, notably the Chronicle of Siirt (PO 4:3, 1907; 5:2, 1910; 7:2, 1910; 13:4, 1918), <ref type="cr">Barḥadbshabba</ref>’s ‘Cause of the Foundation of the Schools’ (PO 4:4, 1907), works by Ishai and <ref type="cr">Ḥenana</ref> (PO 7:1, 1910), and <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>’s ‘Book of the Scholion’ (CSCO 55, 69, 1910, 1912). He also published a number of catalogues of collections of manuscripts in the Middle East (list in Macuch 403–4). His two most important works in Arabic are <i>Kitā</i><i>b ašhar šuhadā</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i> al-mašrīq</i> (2 vols.; Mosul, 1900, 1906) and <i>Ta</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>rīkh Kaldū wa-Āth</i><i>ūr</i>(2 vols.; Beirut 1912–3).</p>

<p>Professor of Semitics; scholar of Syriac, <ref type="cr">Christian Palestinian Aramaic</ref>, and Arabic. Schulthess was born in Zurich, Switzerland. He studied theology in Basel, Göttingen (where he studied with <ref type="cr">P. A. de Lagarde</ref>), and Zürich, followed by Near Eastern languages at the University of Strasbourg (with <ref type="cr">Th. Nöldeke</ref>, among others). From the latter university he received his doctor’s degree in 1894 with a dissertation on the Syriac version of the ‘Life of Antony’ by <ref type="cr">Athanasius of Alexandria</ref>. In 1895 he received his Habilitation from the University of Göttingen, where he also taught for some years. He subsequently held positions at the universities of Königsberg (1910–1914), where he succeeded <ref type="cr">C. Brockelmann</ref>, Strasbourg 
(1914–17), and finally in his home country in Basel (‘Semitic philology’, since 1917). He died prematurely in Basel on 4 Jan. 1922.</p>
<p>While he also has a number of publications in the fields of Arabic and Islam, his scholarly work was primarily focused on Aramaic, in the first place Christian Palestinian Aramaic and Syriac. To the field of Christian Palestinian Aramaic he contributed two important tools, a dictionary (1903) and a grammar (1924, posthumously published, with final editing by E. Littmann and with additional notes by both Littmann and Nöldeke). These two publications have remained authoritative throughout the 20th cent. and only began to be replaced towards the end of the century. Schulthess’s Syriac publications include a number of text editions and studies, some of them dealing with texts outside the realm of Syriac religious literature, such as the Letter of <ref type="cr">Mara bar Serapion</ref> (1897), <ref type="cr">Kalila and Dimna</ref> (1911), and the Sentences of <ref type="cr">Menander</ref> (1912).</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>In the Greek and Syriac legal documents from Osrhoene dating from the early 240s, it is only in the three Syriac documents that the scribe identifies himself by name (see <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Documents</ref>). This practice continues to be frequently found in the <ref type="cr">colophons</ref> to Syriac literary and liturgical manuscripts; there the scribe is normally a deacon, priest, or monk (women scribes are extremely rare: one example is a Maronite priest’s daughter [British Library, Sloane 3597, of 1701]). In a fairly small number of cases the scribe is also the author of the work he is copying; it has been suggested that this may be the case with the single ms. of the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>, and it may also be the case with the ‘Chronography’ of <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref>; <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> may possibly have written the ms. containing his revision of the Hymns of Severus (Brit. Libr. Add. 17,134). In some other cases the scribe is a well-known person, such as Patr. <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, from whom several autographs survive (Nau). Other patriarchal scribes are <ref type="cr">Nuḥ the Lebanese</ref> (ms. Oxford, Marsh 437), Yawsep I (ms. Brit. Libr. Egerton 703), and <ref type="cr">Yawsep</ref>  <ref type="cr">II</ref> (3 mss.).</p>
<p>Quite often, and especially in the last five centuries or so, the role of scribe passes from father to son, and sometimes entire family trees of such families can be constructed (Wilmshurst, 244, 249, 251, for scribal families of <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref>). Several writings of much earlier Syriac authors are only preserved thanks to a number of scribes active around the turn of the 19th and 20th cent.; one of these was the deacon Mattai bar Pawlos of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, working between 1872 and 1934, over 40 of whose mss. are now in the Mingana Collection (Birmingham).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Script, Syriac
</LemmaTitle><p>The Syriac script owes its origin to the Aramaic script of the Achaemenid Persian period (539–330 BC) attested to in many documents, especially from Egypt and Palestine (Elephantine, Samaria, etc.). Adopted originally from the <ref type="cr">Arameans</ref> of Syria (who borrowed it from the Phoenicians), the script became the vehicle for writing Aramaic as a lingua franca used throughout the Persian Empire.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Persian Empire, local variants of the script began to develop, in centers such as <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>, Petra and Palmyra. One such center was <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (modern Urfa) in northern Mesopotamia. Its local kings, whose dynastic line appears to go back to about 130 BC (see <ref type="cr">Abgarids of Edessa</ref>), used a version of the script which by the 1st cent. had developed its own characteristics. The first dated inscription in this local script, now called ‘Syriac’, dates to 6 and comes from Birecik west of Edessa (Syriac <i>Birtā</i>, Greek <i>Makedonopolis</i>). From the 1st cent., and then increasingly in the 2nd and 3rd, there have survived pre-Christian Syriac <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref> in stone and mosaic, many from tombs, in Urfa and its region. From the 3rd cent., we also have legal texts written on parchment (see <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Documents</ref>). There were at least two forms of the early Syriac script, a monumental script used for public inscriptions and a cursive script used for everyday purposes such as the writing of legal texts on soft materials.</p>
<p>From the monumental form of the script there developed in the early Christian period an elegant ‘book-hand’ used especially in the copying of biblical and theological texts. The first dated literary ms. of this kind is dated 411, but this ms. shows a maturity and elegance which suggests that the scribal tradition was already well established. This formal script came to be known as <i>Esṭrangela</i>, a word probably of Greek origin (<i>strongulos</i>) meaning ‘rounded’.</p>
<p>Alongside this, there existed a cursive script, which is rarely attested, but is found occasionally in <ref type="cr">papyri</ref> and in <ref type="cr">colophons</ref> of mss. This cursive script continued the cursive script tradition found in the early legal parchments. Later it came to be used more widely and appears to be the basis of one of the later variants of the Syriac script, the one called <i>Serṭo</i> ‘script’. This form of script was used for literary texts from the 8th cent. and is especially associated with the W.-Syr. tradition.</p>
<p>A third variant of the Syriac script developed in the East. It is an angular version of Esṭrangela and, because of its association with the Ch. of E., is often called ‘Nestorian’. It is known from about 600, but became very distinctive much later (13th cent.).</p>
<p>Throughout the early history of the Syriac script, vowels were not fully represented in writing, though some diacritical dots were used to distinguish words otherwise identical in consonantal form. Eventually Syriac (like Hebrew and Arabic) developed vowel signs which were placed above and below the consonants. Two systems emerged, probably in the 8th cent., a western system based on adaptations of Greek vowels and, apparently a little later, an eastern system consisting of dots.</p>

<p>Jurist and historian of Law; professor at the University of Vienna. Selb was born on 22 May 1929 in Munich. He studied Law in Heidelberg and worked as a judge from 1953 to 1961. As a Law student, he also studied Syriac and Arabic with Anton Schall. In 1962, he earned his Habilitation in the fields of Roman Law, History of Law in Antiquity, Civil Law, and International Private Law, with a study on the Syro-Roman Lawbook. In 1963, he accepted a professorship in Vienna in Roman Law and History of Law in Antiquity. In addition to many publications on both contemporary and Roman Law, with which he gained high esteem, he devoted himself in several books and articles to the history of Law in the Syrian churches. To be singled out are his foundational studies on the character and content of the Syro-Roman Lawbook. He was one of the co-authors of the new edition (with GT and extensive commentary) of this text, which appeared in 2002. He was the first to provide comprehensive introductions to the Church Law of the E.- and W.-Syrians (1981 and 1989, respectively). He also published a previously unknown source of Roman Law preserved in Syriac, which he called ‘Sententiae Syriacae’ (1990, with GT). He undertook many study trips to Turkey and Syria in search of Syriac mss. of juridical content. Selb died on 2 June 1994 in Bad Vöslau near Vienna.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Also known as al-Madāʾin. Located on the Tigris, south of modern <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>. The original Seleucia on the Tigris was established on the west side of the river at the end of the 4th cent. BC as a Hellenistic center by Seleucus I Nicator. Seleucia was largely abandoned for a new center at Ctesiphon during the Parthian period, possibly due to a shift in the course of the Tigris. Although some occupation remained in this area, excavations by an American team indicate that the occupation was primarily industrial. Although the Parthians established Ctesiphon as their capital, its exact location remains uncertain. Based on archaeological material, most scholars locate it on the east side of the Tigris, north of <ref type="cr">Kokhe</ref>. Sasanian and Syriac references to Seleucia-Ctesiphon almost certainly refer not to Old Seleucia, but to the city established by the Sasanians on<ab type="infobox"/> the right bank of the Tigris as their administrative capital, which was known as New Seleucia, Kokhe, or Veh-Ardashir. Seleucia-Ctesiphon was home to the Cath. of the

St. Jean, Maʿhad Mār Yūḥannā al-Ḥabīb
<p>A prestigious Roman Catholic theological seminary in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, Iraq, called Séminaire Syro-Chaldéen St. Jean in French. It was founded by the French Dominican Fathers in 1878, and though it was closed between the beginning of the First World War and 1923, it continued to serve the Chald. and Syr. Catholic churches until 1973, when it was shut down by the Iraqi authorities. It was divided into two main parts: Le Petit Séminaire, a junior and senior high school which consisted of six years of studies after elementary school, where the study of French, Syriac, and Arabic language and literature was essential, and Le Grand Séminaire, which consisted of two years of Philosophy and four years of Theology, including Biblical Studies. Throughout its history, the instruction in both parts of the Seminary was entirely in French, and its strength remained in the study of language and literature. Eminent scholars graduated from this institution, including 1. <ref type="cr">Awgen Manna</ref> (1866–1928) who published <i>Dalīl al-rāghibīn f</i><i>ī lughat al-ārāmiyyīn</i> [Guide for the Students of the Aramaic Language] (Mosul, 1900), an excellent Syriac-Arabic dictionary; 2. the well-known <ref type="cr">Alphonse Mingana</ref> (1878–1937) who published among other things the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref> (Mosul, 1907) and <i>Clef de la langue araméenne</i> (Mosul, 1905), a valuable Syriac grammar; and 3. <ref type="cr">Addai Scher</ref> (martyred in Turkey in 1915), a prolific writer who published the <i>Histoire nestorienne inédite (Chronique de Seert)</i>. Most of the professors were French Dominicans, including the great Syriacist Fr. <ref type="cr">Jean-Maurice Fiey</ref> (1914–95), who was the Director of the Seminary for a short period before he was forced to leave Iraq in 1973. A few Seminary Graduates became professors there, as in the case of Mingana in the 1900s, and in the 1950s and 1960s Fr. Albert Abūnā, professor of Syriac, who published among other things the French translation of the second part of the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of 1234</ref> (1974). Hundreds of Iraqi priests graduated from this Seminary, many becoming bishops and at least one, the Syr. Catholic <ref type="cr">Gabriel Tappuni</ref> (1879–1968), becoming Patr. The Seminary published several internal journals, but the now rare <i>Bulletin du Séminaire Syro-Chaldéen</i> (1940s and 1950s) included scholarly papers on Syriac. In the more recent history of the Seminary, Fr. Joseph Omez (1902–74) was its director, and it was thanks to him that this institution was modernized and some 84 highly educated and multi-lingual priests graduated, some still serving the church of Iraq and elsewhere.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Sergios of Reshʿayna</head><ab type="infobox"/> (d. 536) [Syr. Orth.?] 
<p>Translator of Greek medical and philosophical texts into Syriac. Most of the little that is known of his life has to be gleaned from a paragraph in <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref> (Ecclesiastical History, 9:19). He evidently received his education, which included <ref type="cr">medicine</ref>, in Alexandria, and he is regularly designated in the sources as ‘Archiatros (chief doctor) of <ref type="cr">Reshʿayna</ref>’. Towards the end of his life he was sent by Ephrem, Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> (526/8–545) with a letter to Pope Agapetus; it was on the return from this journey that he died suddenly at Constantinople.</p>
<p>Sergios’s considerable literary output combined both original works, and numerous translations from Greek (a detailed list is given by Hugonnard-Roche, <i>La logique</i>, 125–32). The translations fall into three 
categories:</p>
<p>1. Theological. The corpus of mystical writings attributed to <ref type="cr">Dionysius the Areopagite</ref> (preserved in ms. Sinai Syr. 52, not yet edited apart from extracts). On the basis of a passage in <ref type="cr">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref>’s ‘Book of Questions’, Sergios seems also to have been the translator of the unexpurgated version of <ref type="cr">Evagrius</ref>’s ‘Gnostic Chapters’ (ed. A. Guillaumont [PO 29.1; 1985]; see Guillaumont, <i>Les ‘Kephalaia Gnostica’ d’Évagre le Pontique</i> [1962], 215–27).</p>
<p>2. Medicine and astronomy. A considerable number of medical treatises by <ref type="cr">Galen</ref> are enumerated in a famous letter by <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873) as having been the work of Sergios, but only a few of these survive (e.g. ed. E. Sachau, <i>Inedita Syriaca</i> [1870], 101–34; the second treatise there has recently been identified by G. Saliba, in <i>Byzantion</i> 65 [1995], 443–4, as in fact being closely based on Paul of Alexandria).</p>
<p>3. Philosophy. Notably among these are the Pseudo-Aristotelian work, ‘On the Universe’, addressed to Alexander the Great (ed. de Lagarde, <i>Analecta Syriaca</i> [1858], 134–58), and a treatise ‘On the causes of the Universe’ (unpublished) which has only recently been identified by D. Miller (in <i>SymSyr</i> VI, 221–33) as a work by Alexander of Aphrodisias that is lost in Greek, and preserved elsewhere only in Arabic (ed. C. Genequand 2001). In an influential monograph of 1852 E. Renan (followed by <ref type="cr">Baumstark</ref>), attributed a number of anonymous translations to Sergios, including those of <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Introduction’ to <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>’s logical works, and Aristotle’s ‘Categories’; these attributions, however, are now known to be definitely incorrect.</p>
<p>Sergios’s original writings which survive include: 1. a Treatise on the Spiritual Life (ed. P. Sherwood in <i>L’Orient Syrien</i> 5 [1960], 433–59; 6 [1961], 95–115, 121–156, with FT; IT by E. Vergani [2008]); this prefaces his translation of the Dionysian Corpus. It is already cited, though not by name, by <ref type="cr">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref> in his ‘Commentary on the Liturgy’; 2. a Treatise addressed to Philotheos, on Aristotle’s ‘Categories’ (unpublished; study and partial FT in Hugonnard-Roche, chap. 7); 3. a Treatise addressed to Theodore, ‘On the aim of all Aristotle’s writings’ (unedited; study and FT of Prologue and Book I by Hugonnard-Roche, chap. 8–9); 4. various Scholia on philosophical terms.</p>

<ab type="infobox"/><i>Catena Severi</i> (9th cent.) [Syr. Orth.]
<p>Collection of biblical commentaries (OT and NT) by Severos, a monk in the Monastery of St. Barbara near <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, who completed his work in 861. Severos compiled his work from existing commentaries and mentions as his main sources <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> and <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (for the OT) and <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref> (for the NT). Between the extracts from these works there are a number of long insertions. One of them is a full commentary on the Octateuch by Yaʿqub of Edessa (Kruisheer). In another place a long extract from the Commentary on Isaiah by <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref> was inserted (ter Haar Romeny, 155).</p>
<p>Severos’s work did not reach us in its original form, but in an expanded form, as it was written down a few decades later by the scribe Shemʿun of Ḥisn Manṣur (or Ḥesna d-Manṣur), who worked in the Monastery of the Seven Martyrs near Perrhe (Syr. <i>Parrin</i>). Shemʿun not only copied Severos’s work in a three-volume ms. (Vat. Syr. 103, late 9th or 10th cent., cf. S. E. and J. S.  Assemani, <i>Bibliothecae Apostolicae Vaticanae … Catalogus</i>, I.3 [1759], 7–28), but also — as he himself tells us (f. 371r)  — added in the margins a number of notes and comments extracted from the works of such authors as Cyril of Alexandria, <ref type="cr">Daniel of Ṣalaḥ</ref>, <ref type="cr">Hippolytus</ref>, <ref type="cr">Isidore</ref> (of Pelusium), <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> (many extract from his letters), <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serug</ref>, and from the <ref type="cr">Book of Steps</ref>. Ms. Vat. Syr. 103, which at an unknown date was brought to Egypt, was copied in the Monastery of the Mother of God in Ga­zarta, near Alexandria in (what is today) ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,144 (Wright, <i>Catalogue</i> II, 908a–914a), of which the initial part (113 folios, mainly from quires 2–12) remained in Egypt (presently ms. <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> Syr. 15). In this copy, the marginal comments were incorporated into the main text so that the work of Severos can no longer be distinguished from that of Shemʿun.</p>
<p>Ms. Vat. Syr. 103 left Dayr al-Suryān for Syria before 1646 and later came to <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>, where it was acquired for the Vatican Library by J. S. Assemani in 1716. <ref type="cr">Buṭros Mubārak</ref> (Petrus Benedictus) edited several parts attributed to Ephrem in his Ephrem edition (1737–1740), but in the absence of any tools for the critical study of Ephrem, he was unable to address the question of authenticity and he, therefore, sometimes uncritically combined texts of dubious authenticity with genuine Ephrem materials (such as those preserved in ms. Vat. Syr. 110). It should also be noted that some of the materials included in Severus’s collection have their counterpart in an Armenian commentary attributed to Ephrem (see Mathews).</p>

<p>Patr. since 667/8. Severos was from Dayro da-Pgimto (see under <ref type="cr">Reshʿayna</ref>). Prior to his election as patr. he was metropolitan bp. of <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>. His tenure as patr. is covered in the main historiographical works, in particular in <ref type="cr">Michael</ref> <ref type="cr">Rabo</ref> and <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>. Severos is said to have been a severe man, who ruled harshly, and had the support of the Muslim Caliphs. A conflict arose with some metropolitan bps. about the right of ordination of suffragan bps. When Severos refused to leave that right to the metropolitan bps., the latter deposed and excommunicated him (in 679/80). Severos responded with a counter-excommunication. This stale-mate lasted four years, until Severos, anticipating his death, sent a letter to the mafryono Yuḥanon Sobo (or Yuḥanon the Persian), in which he reiterated his rights and urged the bps. to repent. This letter is preserved, as part of a dossier of six letters related to the conflict, in Michael Rabo (XI.14: vol. 4, 438–44 [Syr.] and vol. 2, 458–68 [FT])  — <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> is said to have copied two of these documents at the requests of the bps. These epistolary efforts indeed led to reconciliation which, however, was fully achieved only at a synod that met in Reshʿayna in the late summer of 684, after Severos had died earlier in the same year.</p>

<p>Scholar, astronomer, philosopher, mathematician, Bp. of Qenneshre (city south of <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>); or Bp. of the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref> on the east bank of the Euphrates. We do not know much of Severos’s life. Some scholars assume that Severos was born at <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>. He became a monk and student in the Monastery of Qenneshre, the famous center of Greek learning founded by <ref type="cr">John bar Aphtonia</ref>. According to the Maron.

Theodore to hold a debate on religious matters with the Maronites in the presence of Muʿāwiyya. Several parts of his works survive, although only few have been published to date. Some of Severos’s astronomical works were (partially) published by 
F. Nau and E. Sachau. The most notable of these are: the ‘Treatise on the Astrolabe’ and the ‘Treatise on the Constellations’. Severos wrote several works concerning the logic of <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>, among which are his ‘Treatise on Syllogisms’ (written in 638) and his Letters to Bp. Aitalaha of Nineveh and the periodeutes Yawnan. According to the ms. tradition Severos translated from Middle Persian into Syriac a short exposition of 
Aristotle’s ‘De interpretatione’, which was composed by <ref type="cr">Pawlos the Philosopher</ref> (6th cent.; also known as Pawlos the Persian). Some scholars suggested that Severos translated from Middle Persian into Syriac Pawlos’s compendium on the logic of Aristotle, which was addressed to the Persian shah Khusrau I (for the question of the language in which Pawlos wrote, see Pawlos the Philosopher).</p>

<Author>G. J. Reinink</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Severus of Antioch</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. 538) [Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, theologian, and prolific Greek author. Severus is generally recognized as the most important Greek theologian of the 6th cent., and he remains, along with <ref type="cr">Philoxenos</ref>, the main authority on christology for the Syr. Orth. tradition. He originated from Sozopolis in Pisidia and came from a pagan family (the claim in the Life by <ref type="cr">John bar Aphtonia</ref> that his grandfather was a bp. is unfounded). He studied first in Alexandria and then at the Law school in <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>. During his time in Beirut he was converted to Christianity and was baptised in the shrine of St. Leontius in Tripoli (488). He then adopted a monastic life near Gaza, but from 508–11 he was in Constantinople, in support of the anti-Chalcedonian cause. When Flavian was deposed from the patriarchal see of Antioch in 512, Severus was elected as his successor. After the death of the emperor Anastasius (518), and with the new pro-Chalcedonian ecclesiastical policy of Justin I, he escaped to Egypt where he spent the rest of his life, apart from a brief visit to Constantinople in 536, summoned by Justinian. Back in Egypt, he died two years later (8 Feb. 538). On his return to Egypt in 536 the emperor had his writings (in Greek) condemned, with the result that most of them survive only in Syriac translations. The most important of these are the 125 ‘Cathedral’ Homilies, preached during his time on the patriarchal throne: these come down (not quite complete) in two forms, the earlier perhaps translated by <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Kallinikos</ref>, and the later one as a careful revision, made by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> over a century later. Only Homily 77 survives in the Greek original, thanks to its re-attribution to <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nyssa</ref> or to Hesychius of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Most of his other works are theological treatises refuting either Chalcedonian polemic (thus the Against the Grammarian [= John of Caesarea], the Discourses addressed to Nephalius, and the Philalethes), or the more extreme anti-Chalcedonians (thus the Correspondence with Sergios). There is also an extensive polemical work against <ref type="cr">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref>, with whose views on incorruptibility of the flesh of Christ he disagreed. Severus was also a tireless letter writer, but only a very small proportion of his vast correspondence survives in Syriac translation. A collection of hymns (<i>maʿnyoto</i>), often misleadingly referred to as the Oktoechos, includes several by him. Quite a number of excerpts on exegetical matters are preserved in Greek in certain of the Catenae collections.</p>
<p>A number of biographies of Severus survive; of these the two most important are those by John, abbot of the monastery of Beth Aphtonia (John bar Aphtonia), and <ref type="cr">Zacharias Rhetor</ref> (his fellow student at Beirut). The latter (covering only up to 512) is a response to a pamphlet that had been put out claiming that Severus had taken part as a student in pagan rites.</p>

<p>Syriac sources count Mar Shaliṭa among the traditional seventy disciples of <ref type="cr">Mar Awgen</ref>. An Egyptian from Alexandria, he too went out, took the habit, and spent time in the Monastery of Pachomius. With Mar Awgen and his disciples he went to <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>. Later, he moved to the village of Penek in Beth Zabdai, where he spent the rest of his life working miracles, destroying idols, healing, and converting the heathen. He also built a church there and was buried in it when he died at the age of ninety-two. The Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref> claims that he went at the end of his life to <ref type="cr">Balad</ref> where he was buried in a cavern, over which a large monastery was built. A Syriac Life of Mar Shaliṭa adds the detail that while in Nisibis, he went with <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> to Mt. Qardu where the Ark of Noah rested, and there they built a church.</p>
<p>An earlier Armenian source, The Epic Histories, however, knows nothing of Shaliṭa’s connection to Mar Awgen or to Yaʿqub. Here, he is rather a disciple of the Syr. bp. Daniel, and he lived in the desert as an anchorite. After the death of the Armenian Patr. Nerses, he went to the Armenian district of Kordukʿ where he lived among lions and performed numerous miracles and healings. This source also attributes the story of the healing of a wounded lion’s paw, traditionally associated with Jerome, to Mar Shaliṭa.</p>

<p>Sun worshipers who converted to the Syr. Orth. faith around the 6th cent., according to later testimonies. From the 14th cent. onward, they lived in and around <ref type="cr">Amid</ref> and <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>. They must have been looked upon with suspicion from the 14th until the 16th cent., for they resorted to obtaining at least eight bulls from various patriarchs and maph. testifying to their membership in the Syr. Orth. faith. The first testimony that survives is given by Patr. <ref type="cr">Abrohom II Gharīb</ref> dated 25 July 1436, from which many later testimonies draw their text. The Shamsi followed the liturgical rites of the Syr. Orth., but had their own social traditions. Probably until the 19th  cent., they did not intermarry with others. They used to bury their dead with furniture and personal belongings, especially weapons, gold and silver, in their own cemeteries. In the mid-19th cent., they started marrying other Syr. Orth. There were around 70 families of them in Amid and Mardin in the period of World War  I, and they had their own Church (Virgin Mary) in Mardin. A  few families survive in Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, and the US.</p>

<p>Scholar, probably active as a teacher in the theological school and perhaps also in the Christian medical teaching institute (<i>beth mardutā</i>) of <ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref> (Gondeshapur) in Khuzistan. In the Syriac tradition Ṣharbokht is known through the <ref type="cr">Gannat Bussāme</ref>, an extensive commentary on the E.-Syr. lectionary. In this commentary Ṣharbokht is adduced more than 150 times in the exegesis of pericopes from the four Gospels, Acts, and Rom. However, the influence of Ṣharbokht’s exegesis in the <i>Gannat Bussāme</i> many times exceeds these quotations, since the author of the <i>Gannat Bussāme</i> borrowed many long excerpts from Ṣharbokht’s commentaries without mentioning him by name. In the first quotation of Ṣharbokht in the <i>Gannat Bussāme</i>he is introduced with his Christian name and the name of his father as ‘Ṣliba Zkha (‘the cross has overcome’), who is the priest and teacher Ṣharbokht, the son of Msargis’. The name of his father and some significant details of his exegesis make it very likely that Ṣharbokht bar Msargis may be identified with Ṣahārbūkht b. Māsarjīs, who according to the Arabic-Islamic tradition was the author of a commentary on the <i>Kunnāš</i> (a medical handbook) written by a certain Jūrjīs (George). From the Arabic-Islamic tradition it can be inferred that Ṣahārbūkht b. Māsarjīs belonged to a family of physicians from Beth Lapaṭ (9th cent.). His son ‘Īsā is reported to have translated Hippocratic works from Syriac into Arabic. The important role which Greek medical knowledge — in particular Hippocratic and Galenic tradition — plays in Ṣharbokht’s exegesis seems to corroborate the assumption that Ṣharbokht bar Msargis and Ṣahārbūkht b. Māsarjīs are, in fact, one and the same person. Ṣharbokht’s biblical commentaries are typical representatives of exegetical compilations comparable to the biblical commentaries written by other scholars of the Ch. of E. in the 9th cent., e.g. <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>. Ṣharbokht’s commentaries are a rich mine of information for older exegetical traditions which are no longer accessible today in the (lost) original works or in the other E.-Syr. exegetical compilations. The most remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of Ṣharbokht’s commentaries is the strong influence of medical knowledge. Theoretical <ref type="cr">medicine</ref> has become in Ṣharbokht’s exegesis a veritable ancillary science for the explanation of the Scriptures. In this respect Ṣharbokht represents a unique example of the mutual influence of theological and profane learning in the 9th-cent. Christian milieu in Beth Lapaṭ, when E.-Syr. scholars from this city played a fundamental role in the transmission of among other things Greek medical knowledge to the Arabs in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The name refers to the tip of a height dominating the towns of Darʿūn and Ḥarīṣa, located some 25 km. to the northeast of <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref>. It was purchased by Patr. Mīkhāʾīl Jarweh in 1786 for his nascent uniate church, naming it the ‘Monastery of Our Lady of Deliverance’ (<i>morath šuzobo</i> = <i>sayyidat al-najāt</i>). He then turned it into a patriarchal seat, and it remained so until 1852 when the seat was transferred to <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>. After the Genocide of World War I (see <ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref>), Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref> moved the patriarchate to Beirut, where Patr. <ref type="cr">Gabriel Tappuni</ref> built an imposing residence in 1930 in the al-Ashrafiyya quarter. In Sharfeh, Patr. Jarweh also founded a priestly institution: elementary seminary which corresponded to secondary school and an advanced seminary which offered courses in philosophy and theology. In 1950, Cardinal Gabriel Tappuni erected a new building for the two seminaries, including a beautiful church that stands between them. Several generations of ecclesiastics graduated from Sharfeh during one and a half centuries of its academic history, including the current Syr. Cath. Patr. Yawsep III Yonan before he studied theology in Rome. Priestly studies nowadays are pursued in Kaslik University, while the seminary serves as residence. Sharfeh is also the summer patriarchal seat and the home of the Ephremite monks as well. This order was founded in 1705 in Lebanon in the Monastery of St. Ephrem al-Ragham, and it moved to Mardin in 1881 to be eradicated by the Ottoman Turks in World War 1. It was reestablished in Sharfeh in 2000 by Cardinal Mūsā Dāʾūd, then patriarch of the Syr. Cath. Church. Sharfeh has a rich collection of Syriac manuscripts that have been catalogued more than once.</p>

<p>Patr. Eshai was consecrated as a boy of eleven after the death of his uncle Mar Shemʿon Pawlos. The consecration took place on 20 June 1920 at the Baʿqūba refugee camp near <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>. (In recent Church sources his birthday is usually given as 26 Feb. 1908, making him twelve at the time of his consecration.) After some schooling in England (1924–7) Mar Shemʿon returned to <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> and assumed the role of the Patr. as civil head of his people. He demanded that the League of Nations make special arrangements for the <ref type="cr">Assyrians</ref> after the end of the British Mandate in Iraq in 1932, but this demand failed, and after confrontation with the new government he was deported with his family to Cyprus in 1933. In 1940 he went to the USA, settling first in <ref type="cr">Chicago</ref> and later (1954) in San Francisco. In 1948 he at last let go of the idea of the ‘temporal power’ of the Patr. and began a policy of rebuilding the church in all the countries where its members were now dispersed. In 1964 he and Metropolitan Mar Yosip Ḥenanishoʿ issued a ‘synodical letter’ dictating, among other reforms, the adoption of the Gregorian calendar. This was resented especially by some in Iraq, and in 1968 a schism ensued under Mar <ref type="cr">Toma Darmo</ref>. In 1973 Mar Shemʿon married, an action which, though not strictly uncanonical, threw the church into confusion. Before his status could be settled, he was murdered in Nov. 1975 by a disaffected nationalist. Eshai (Mar Shemʿon XXIII; but XXI in sources before 1940) was the last of the hereditary patriarchs of the Ch. of E.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Shemʿon bar Ṣabbaʿe</head><ab type="infobox"/> (d. 341 or 344) [Ch. of E.]
<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> and martyr. Shemʿon was probably the immediate successor of <ref type="cr">Papa bar ʿAggai</ref> (d. between 327 and 335), but nothing is known about his tenure as bp. prior to his arrest. His name ‘son of the dyers’ may refer to the profession of textile dying. Our main sources about Shemʿon are two interrelated Syriac texts: 1. the ‘Martyrdom of Shemʿon’ (first published by E. Assemani, <i>Acta sanctorum martyrum</i> I [1748]); and 2. the longer ‘History of Shemʿon’ (first published by P. Bedjan, <i>Acta martyrum et sanctorum</i> II [1891]). Both texts were published by M. Kmosko in 1907, who called them MS1 ‘Recensio antiquior’ and MS2 ‘Recensio recentior’, respectively. Both texts are preserved in mss. that contain larger collections of E.-Syr. martyrdoms, which mostly are joined together with hagiographies and martyrdoms of the W.-Syr. tradition. One of the primary mss. for the ‘Martyrdom’, Vat. Syr. 160, is of disputed date (some parts of the ms. are from the 6th cent., but for this particular part Assemani proposed a 10th-cent. date, which seems too late); the other mss. are from the 9th cent. and later, belonging to either the E.-Syr. or the W.-Syr. tradition. <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> played an important role in the transmission of the texts, as mss. Vat. Syr. 160 and 161 (the latter containing portions of both texts) were kept there, and ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,645 (which contains the ‘Martyrdom’) was written there in 932. Ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,174, an important witness of the ‘History’ was written in the time of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, at the expense of a deacon from <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor</ref> <ref type="cr">Barṣawmo</ref>. The ‘Martyrdom’, or a text closely related to it, was known to Sozomen, who incorporated some information on Shemʿon in his Ecclesiastical History (II.9–10), which was written ca. 445. Among the later sources, Shemʿon receives attention in the Arabic Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref> and ‘Book of the Tower’, as well as in <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s Chronicle (see Wiessner, 79–94). The E.-Syr. Breviary attributes to Shemʿon some hymns (ed. with LT Kmosko, 1048–55).</p>
<p>According to both Syriac texts, Shemʿon was arrested when he refused to comply with a royal order to raise a double tax from the Christian community. This happened probably in 340, when the Sasanian king Shapur II (309–379) was engaged in warfare with the Romans and the Persian Christians came under the suspicion of sympathizing with the Romans. In the introduction to the ‘Martyrdom’ the predicament of the Christians is compared with the oppression of the Jews in the time of the Maccabees, and the ‘two priests’, Judas (Maccabaeus) and Shemʿon, are portrayed as fighting for the same cause. Arrested in Seleucia, Shemʿon was transported to Karka d-Ledan, in Beth Huzaye, where he had several meetings with the king. A long subplot (in both Syr. texts and in Sozomen) concerns Shemʿon’s encounter with the defector Gushtazad, who upon seeing Shemʿon decided to return to his Christian faith and became a martyr even before Shemʿon. After having been given ample opportunity to rescind his position and to pay homage to the king and his gods, Shemʿon is executed. While the ‘History’, to a certain extent, expands on the ‘Martyrdom’, Wiessner has argued convincingly that the author of the ‘History’ had access to additional sources and in some cases deliberately updated the ‘Martyrdom’ theologically and ideologically. For both the ‘Martyrdom’ and the ‘History’ the question arises as to what extent they may be used as historical sources, a question that becomes even more pertinent if one takes into consideration that there were several decades between the events that are reported and the redaction of the texts. The final redaction probably took place in the early 5th cent., or — in the case of the ‘History’ — well into the 5th cent.</p>
<p>Several other martyr texts deal with the persecution under Shapur II. Among the texts that are most closely related to the Shemʿon texts are the Martyrdom of Tarbo, Shemʿon’s sister (ed. Bedjan, <i>AMS</i> 2, 254–60) and the Martyrdom of Pusay (or Pusayk) and Marta (ibid., 208–32 and 233–41).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir</head><ab type="infobox"/>(7th or 8th cent.) 
[Ch. of E.]
<p>Author of a treatise on family and hereditary law; metropolitan bp. Shemʿon wrote his law book in Persian, but it is known to us only in the Syr. translation of an anonymous monk from <ref type="cr">Beth Qaṭraye</ref>. Presented in the form of questions and answers, the law book consists of 22  chapters and begins with some reflections on the sources of Christian law, for which the author gives priority to the tradition of the Fathers. This law book, in its Syriac version, became authoritative in the juridical tradition of the Ch. of E. It is included in the important ms. Alqosh 
Syr. 169, the primary source for the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>.</p>
<p>The translator, in his introduction, refers to Shemʿon, the author of the Persian work, as ‘priest and teacher’ and metropolitan bp. of Rev Ardashir. This raises the important question of whether this Shemʿon is the same person as metropolitan <ref type="cr">Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir</ref> who was one of the protagonists in the rebellion against Cath. <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> (649–59), a rebellion that spread to the bishops of Beth Qaṭraye. Unfortunately the law book cannot be dated with precision. While there is obviously some connection between Shemʿon’s law book and that of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿbokht of Rev Ardashir</ref> (whose dates are also somewhat disputed, but who belongs to the 8th cent.), it remains unclear which one of the two preceded the other. Sachau thought that Ishoʿbokht preceded Shemʿon and that the author of the law book should be distinguished from the rebellious bishop (xix-xx). Other scholars, however, leave the question open (e.g. Dauvillier and more recently Brock), even though Shemʿon’s law book is usually discussed before that of Ishoʿbokht (which is also the sequence in ms. Alqosh Syr. 169). Whether the two metropolitans by the name of Shemʿon are one and the same person must, therefore, also remain undecided.</p>

(late 12th – early 13th cent.) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>Author, teacher of <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref> (for Shemʿon’s name, which refers to the village of Shaqlāwa [or Shanqlabad], near <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>, see G. Hoffmann, <i>Auszüge aus syrischen Akten persischer Märtyrer</i> [1880], 231–3). No information about Shemʿon’s life is available, but some of his works are preserved. The first is called ‘Chronicon’ and is a treatise on chronology and on the calendar, in the form of questions and answers, for the use of his disciple Bar Zoʿbi. He requested the work from Shemʿon, because he and his companions did not have access to the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref> and so were often at a loss when they found references to Eusebius in the works of earlier authors. In addition to being a general introduction to chronology, the work also deals with the Christian holidays. It is preserved in some mss. in Western libraries, e.g. Brit. Libr. Add. 25,875, dated 1709 (Wright, <i>Catalogue</i>, vol. 3, 1067b–68b) and Berlin 102 (Sachau, 108), perhaps 16th cent. (cf. E.  Sachau, <i>Verzeichniss der syrischen Handschriften</i>, 357–59), but apart from extracts (in Müller), it has remained unedited.</p>
<p>Another work by Shemʿon is a mystical poem of moralizing content (ed. Cardahi). It is transmitted in ms. Vat. Syr. 187, along with a commentary by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (see S. E. and J. S. Assemani, <i>Bibliothecae Apostolicae Vaticanae … Catalogus</i>, I.3 [1759], 404–5). Probably from a different work is a small collection of ‘sayings’ attributed to Shemʿon, preserved in ms. Alqosh 291 (cf. J.  Vosté, <i>Catalogue de la Bibliothèque syro-chaldéenne du ­Couvent de Notre-Dame des Semences</i> [1929], 107, no. 10). Finally, Shemʿon may also be the author of a treatise on the Eucharist and Baptism, preserved in the same Brit. Libr. ms. that has the ‘Chronicon’ (Add. 25,875).</p>

<p>One of the bright representatives of E.-Syr. mysticism. Nothing is known of his life, except that he was a renowned physician at the time of Cath. <ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ I</ref> (685/6–692/3); he was also known as Luqa, while in the ms. tradition he is referred to as ‘a disciple of Rabban Shabur’ (middle of the 7th cent.), which implies either that he was his direct disciple or that he resided in the monastery of Rabban Shabur (modern southwest Iran). <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> attributes to him three books: on the monastic life; on medicine; and on the interpretation of the mysteries of the cell. Whereas the first and the third title seem to correspond to the extant ‘Book of Grace’ (attributed in the W.-Syr. ms. tradition to <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>; for the list of mss., see Vööbus) and the <i>memrā</i> ‘On the consecration of the cell’ (ms. olim Alqosh, Notre-Dame des Semences; Vosté 237 and its later copies), respectively, his medical work is known only from the quotations in the Lexicon of <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>. ʿAbdishoʿ’s list is to be supplemented by a group of short fragments of unidentified provenance preserved in the aforementioned Alqosh ms. as well as by sentences of mystical content (ms. Sharfeh, Rahmani 80, and the lost ms. <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref> 109). Moreover, <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref> attributes to him a life of Mar Gani, which seems to be lost. His mystical works were used both by E.-Syr. (e.g. <ref type="cr">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref>) and W.-Syr. authors (e.g. <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>).</p>
<p>The probable explanation of the name of Shemʿon d-Ṭaybutheh (lit. ‘of his grace’) is that it derives from the title of his book, viz. the ‘Book of Grace’. The history of scholarship on this text and its authenticity proceeded from the acceptance of the authorship of Isḥaq based predominantly on the data provided by mss. (Vööbus, Bunge) to the critical investigation of a wider scope which resulted in the plausibility of the attribution to Shemʿon with acknowledgment of strong influence of Isḥaq’s writings upon Shemʿon (Miller, Bettiolo). The comparative study of the ‘Book of Grace’ in the context of the extant works of Isḥaq and Shemʿon as well as of the interrelationship of the ms. tradition of their works still remains a desideratum.</p>
<p>Although Shemʿon evidently draws on the authoritative writings of <ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>, <ref type="cr">Mark the Monk</ref>, <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</ref>, Makarios, etc., it is not yet clear how he interpreted the tradition, while developing original doctrine with emphasis on the role of the divine grace in the life of the monk and special attention to the issue of interdependence between the body and the spiritual life.</p>

<p>Writer, maph. of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> (1710–40), and martyr. He was born in Beth Manʿem ca. 1670 to Malke b. Ayyub and Saydeh. He became a monk ca. 1690 and visited <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> in 1695. Shortly after, he was ordained a priest and became a <i>ḥ</i><i>bišoyo</i> ‘recluse’ at Dayro d-Mor Yaʿqub near <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>. He was consecrated maph. for Ṭur ʿAbdin in 1710 by Patr. <ref type="cr">Isḥoq ʿAzar</ref> at the church of Mor Thoma in Qaṭrabil near <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>. The following year, however, Shemʿun temporarily retired from the responsibilities of the maphrianate without abdicating, preferring the life of a <i>ḥbišoyo</i> at Dayro d-Mor Yaʿqub. In 1725, he brought about a reconciliation between <ab type="infobox"/>the Patriarchate of Ṭur ʿAbdin, upon the death of its Patr. Ignatius Denḥo, with the mainstream Patriarchate in <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, a union which lasted for 15 years. He returned to actively administer the maphrianate in 1727.</p>
<p>Shemʿun was tortured then killed on 6 Apr. 1740 by ʿAbdal Agha, a local Kurdish warlord, for refusing to grant a matrimonial permission for the Agha’s Syr. Orth. servant who wished to marry a close cousin, an act prohibited by the canon law of the time. Shemʿun is particularly known for a Kurdish song, <i>Lawij</i> ‘lyrical song’, which he is said to have recited during an audience with the Kurdish Amir of Jazireh, Muḥammad al-Bakhti, during the time when ʿAbdal Agha was trying to get Shemʿun killed.</p>
<p>His literary works include: 1. A book on religion and theology (ms. Syr. Orth. Patr. Libr.); 2. A book on the Sacraments, <i>Markabat al-asrār</i> (lost); 3. Another theological book, <i>Ṣilāḥ</i><cTypeface:Italic>̣<i> al-dī</i><i>n wa-turs al-yaqīn</i> (ms.); 4. A collection of sermons (ms.); 5. A collection of poems and <i>memre</i> (a few ed. by Çiçek); 6. An abridged dictionary based on that of <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref> (ms.); 7. A commentary on the Lord’s Prayer (ed.

[Syr. Orth.]
<p>Polemical writer and bp. The main source for Shemʿun’s life is a much romanticized and not very informative chapter in <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>’s ‘Lives of the Eastern Saints’ (ed. Brooks; see Harvey, 97–98). Shemʿun was of Persian origin. There is no evidence that he ever studied at the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref>, even though the School is an important target in his invective. While Yuḥanon presents Shemʿun as bp. (and is followed in this by the later tradition), Beth Arsham, said to be near <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, is not otherwise known as an episcopal see, which led Fiey to suggest that Shemʿun was an itinerant bp. and that Beth Arsham was his native town, rather than his diocese (Fiey, 126).</p>
<p>From ca. 500 Shemʿun was active in opposing the spread of dyophysitism in Armenia (where he attended a synod in 505/06; see Garsoïan, 186), in Persia, and in the Byzantine Empire. As a ‘brave warrior on behalf of the true faith’ (Yuḥanon of Ephesus), he often engaged in public debates of high visibility, by which he gained the title ‘Persian debater’ (<i>dorušo parsoyo</i>). At an old age he went to Constantinople, where he met with Yuḥanon of Ephesus and where Empress <ref type="cr">Theodora</ref> (d. 548) paid homage to him, before he died there, probably in the early 540s.</p>
<p>Among Shemʿun’s writings Yuḥanon of Ephesus mentions ‘refutations against heretics’ and ‘many letters on the faith, to many believers everywhere’. Two letters, perhaps three, are preserved. The first is ‘On <ref type="cr">Barṣawma</ref> bp. of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> and the heresy of the Nestorians’ (ed. Assemani with LT; FT in Garsoïan, 450–56; ET in Becker); its specific historical context and date are not known, but it most likely was written during the reign of the Roman Emperor Anastasius (491–518). After having traced the genealogy of (what he saw as) Nestorianism from the Jews in Jesus’ day to Paul of Samosata, <ref type="cr">Diodore of Tarsus</ref>, <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>, <ref type="cr">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref>, <ref type="cr">Hiba</ref>of<ref type="cr"> Edessa</ref>, and the School of the Persians, he forcefully denounces leaders and scholars of the School, in particular <ref type="cr">Aqaq</ref>, Barṣawma of Nisibis, and <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>. To these he opposes those who remained faithful to the true faith and rejected Nestorianism and any mention of ‘two Sons, one by nature and one by adoption’. The second letter deals with the persecution of Christians in the city of <ref type="cr">Nagran</ref> (the date of which is disputed: either 518 or 523). Shemʿun’s letter was written from <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref> in 524 (ed. Guidi). Although it focuses on the events of the persecution, it also contains polemical notes against both Nestorians and Chalcedonians. I. Shahîd, who discovered and edited a different letter on the same topic, argued for Shemʿun’s authorship of this new letter as well (which is anonymous). In addition, he suggested that Shemʿun is also the author of ‘Book of the Ḥimyarites’ (see <ref type="cr">Ḥimyar</ref>), which is only fragmentarily known (ed. A. Moberg) and which deals with the same persecution. These two attributions, however, have not been widely accepted.</p>

(ca. 380–459) 
<p>Saint. Born in the village of Sisa near Nicopolis, Shemʿun was the child of Christian parents. Uninstructed in the faith, he happened to enter a church, and thereafter sought God. First he lived with some ascetics near his village, and then spent 10 years in the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Tell ʿAda</ref> before being asked to leave because of his extreme ascetic practices. He traveled to Telneshe, where he spent 3 years on a nearby summit in a small domed hut before standing in the open air within a circle of stones. Later, he mounted the first of several increasingly higher pillars till he reached a height of around 20 meters. Here he took his stance of continual prayer. For 47 years he prayed and prostrated, adjudicated and advised, healed and harmed. His fame reached from the Persian Empire to Britain, and pilgrims flocked to his pillar from all levels of society. His novel asceticism of standing on a pillar aroused criticism, but was later imitated. Shemʿun attempted to persuade <ref type="cr">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref> to accept the Formula of Reunion of 433 between bishops John of Antioch and <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>. On his death, his body was brought with great pomp to <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> and buried there. His life is known through the works of three writers: Theodoret of Cyrrhus devoted to Shemʿun a chapter of his ‘History of the Monks of Syria’, written in 444 before the death of Shemʿun; a life written in Syriac and extant in 3 mss. (ms. Vat. Syr. 160, ed. S. E. Assemani, <i>Acta Sanctorum et Martyrum</i>, vol. II [1748], 230–398; ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,484, ed. Bedjan, <i>AMS</i>, vol. IV, 507–644; Dam. Patr. 12/17) seems to stem from the monastic community which grew up around Shemʿun’s pillar and would have been written in the last half of the 5th cent.; finally, a life in Greek claiming to have been written by his intimate disciple, Antonius. The three lives give basically the same description of Shemʿun’s life till his stance on the pillar and of the circumstances surrounding his death, but there are almost no narratives in common for the time he spent on the pillar. In what appears to be a genuine letter to bp. Basil of Antioch, Shemʿun accepts the Council of Chalcedon, though 3 letters ascribed to him are anti-Chalcedon. His feast day is 27 July for the Syr. Church, 1 Sept. for the Greek Church.</p>

<p>Bp. and writer. Shlemon was the metropolitan bp. of Prat d-Mayshan, or Baṣra, on the banks of the Shatt al-Arab in southern Iraq. He was originally from the town of Akhlat, located on the northwest coast of Lake Van. Little is known about his life except that he was in attendance at the consecration of the Ch. of E. Cath. Sabrishoʿ in 1222 (Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, 3.1.453). <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> lists a number of Shlemon’s literary works in his ‘Catalogue’, including prayers, treatises, a discourse on heaven and earth, and the ‘Book of the Bee’ (<i>ktābā d-debboritā</i>) (Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, 3.1.309). The ‘Book of the Bee’ is by far Shlemon’s best known work. Its purpose is to explain the work of divine dispensation in the history of the world, from Creation to the Resurrection. In this work, Shlemon gleans ideas and excerpts from a wide variety of writings. Hence, the title draws upon the illustration of a bee gathering (<i>lqṭ</i>) nectar from multiple flowers.</p>

<p>Writer on ascetic life and biblical commentator; metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>, whose see city was <ref type="cr">Karka d-Beth Slokh</ref>, now Kirkuk, to the south of the upper Lesser Zab river, and approx. 170 km. south-east of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> and 250 north of <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>. The last known bp. of that see for the Sasanian period, he was a contemporary of <ref type="cr">Grigor I</ref>, Cath. 605–ca. 609, of the monastic reformer and theologian <ref type="cr">Babai the Great</ref>, and of the biblical commentator <ref type="cr">Barḥadbshabba</ref>. He was noted among his ascetical and literary contemporaries for his virtue of life and for his writings, and his name is included in the lists of ascetical writers in Mesopotamia catalogued by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> and <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref> of Baṣra.</p>
<p>Shubḥalmaran was one of a group, including the monk Mar<ref type="cr"></ref>Gewargi of Izla, who in 612 successfully urged on the monarch Khusrau the Victorious (r. 590–628) the rightness of the ‘orthodox’ (i.e. E.-Syr.) cause, though without persuading him to restore the Catholicate, suspended after the death of Grigor I. However, he failed in his attempts to thwart the schemes of Gabriel of Shingar, the court physician, to appropriate church property. Gabriel’s vengeful intrigues to pay off old scores on this and other accounts, moral and theological, resulted in his lifetime exile and the martyrdom of Gewargi as a convert from Mazdaism.</p>
<p>A collection of Shubḥalmaran’s writings on ascetic life and on the end times are preserved with others by <ref type="cr">Abraham of Nathpar</ref> and Barḥadbshabba in the 9th-cent. ms. Brit. Libr. Or. 6714. One folio is found in ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Ar. 6725, and another in ms. Birmingham, Mingana Syr. 631. Quotations from his exegetical works are to be found in Sabrishoʿ bar Pawlos.</p>
<p>The folios in the Brit. Libr. ms. do not provide one single work, ‘The Book of Gifts’, but a collection of pieces on the themes of self-denial and spiritual combat. Fols. 1–30r present ‘The Book of Gifts’ and describe 15 virtues (gifts) which cumulatively form the crowning virtue of Love. Fols. 30r–41v contain 13 ‘Chapters concerning wise admonitions’; Fols. 41v–54r give 22 ‘More warnings and admonitions’ set out alphabetically; Fols. 54r–60r contain ‘Further chapters ... for brethren to live in accord’; Fols. 60r–62r contain ‘Revelations about the assembly of believers’. Fol. 62r-v provide ‘Dark sayings of our Lord and Paul about the last time’, and Fols. 62v–73r ‘Revelations about the last time’. The texts on ff. 60r–73r are also to be found in Sinai, New Finds, Syr. M20N.</p>
<p>Shubḥalmaran provides his letters (e.g. on reluctance to be an ascetic), portraits of virtue (e.g. voluntary renunciation and humility), and precepts or canons (e.g. for communal sleeping arrangements and for solitary household management) in response to the problems brought by these expressions of asceticism: he does not write for the pure solitaries. His writings are characterised by a large use of scripture, quoted directly or allusively, and a sharp turn of phrase to express spiritual and social perspicacity. In Syriac <ref type="cr">monasticism</ref> he stands at a stage when pragmatic use of scripture and good sense shaped ascetic life, rather than speculative and philosophical concepts. These came with the influence of the philosopher monk <ref type="cr">Evagrius</ref> and his Syriac adaptors. These, e.g. <ref type="cr">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref>, patterned the kinds of ascetic life into a progression which matched stages between the created and the uncreated order: Shubḥalmaran is closer to <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, and fits into the context of the traditional monasticism of his contemporaries associated with the Monastery at Mt. Izla.</p>

<p>A city in eastern Turkey, southwest of Lake Van. During the late Ottoman period, it was part of the Vilayet of Bitlis, adjacent to the Vilayet of Diar-Bakir (see <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>) located to its northeast. Kurds made up more than half of the entire population, which also included a large portion of Christian families, namely Armenian, Syr. Orth., E. Syr., and Chald., in addition to small numbers of Syr. Catholics and Protestants. Siirt is made famous by the Chronicle of Siirt, an early 11th cent. Christian Arabic source published by <ref type="cr">Addai Scher</ref>, bp. of the city. The anonymous Chronicle is missing its first folios, and in its actual condition, covers the ecclesiastical history from the middle of the 3rd cent., time of the Roman emperor Gallus, to the middle of the 7th cent., time of the monastic writer <ref type="cr">Sahdona</ref>. Siirt was the seat of a Chald. bp. from 1553, and the list of bishops from this time to 1915 can be reconstructed. The last bp. of Siirt was Addai Scher, a prolific writer and critical scholar who was murdered and mutilated near Siirt on 15 June 1915. All the Christians of the city and region without exception fell victim to the massacres that were perpetrated against them at the beginning of World War I, in such a way that Christianity was wiped out in the city after 1925. It is said that before Bp. Scher died, he hid his collection of books and mss. in a dry well, wrapped to be protected from humidity, but the well cannot be now located.</p>

The first collection of questions and answers, in 20 sections and bearing the heading ‘matters (<i>šarbe</i>) [taken] from the books of non-Christian authors (<i>barrāye</i>) and philosophers, collected by Mar Silwanos, bishop of Qardu’, deals with such subjects as atheism, astrology, determinism, dualism, the problem of evil, angelology, and superstitious practices. The second collection, with 44 questions, deals with philosophy in general and with the subject matters of <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Eisagoge’ and <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>’s ‘Categories’ and ‘On interpretation’.

</LemmaTitle><p>The Book of Sindbad the Sage, on the wiles of women, is probably a product of the Late Sasanian Empire (Perry), though others have considered that it is of Indian origin. The work (to be distinguished from the tales of Sindbad the Sailor) proved to be very popular and was translated into many different languages, eastern and western, the latter via Hebrew (Sendebar, ed. M. Epstein, 1967) and Spanish (the European versions often go under the title ‘The 7 Sages of Rome’). All versions ultimately go back to a lost Middle Persian text by way of Arabic. The Syriac version is the earliest extant witness, having been translated from a lost Arabic intermediary (ca. 9th cent.); in the 11th cent. the Syriac was in turn translated into Greek in <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref> by Michael Andreopoulos (who rendered the name as Syntipas).

<p>The Legend tells about seven (in Syriac most often eight) young Christian men who during the period of the persecution of the Christians by the Roman emperor Decius (249–251) refused to offer sacrifice to pagan gods, and taking advantage of the emperor’s temporary absence from Ephesus, escaped to the mountains outside the city, where they hid in a cave and fell asleep. Having returned, the emperor gave orders to wall up the cave so that the young men would die buried alive. However, 195 years later, in the 38th year of the reign of the Christian emperor Theodosius II (401–450), i.e. 445/6, they woke up, and since the wall had been removed they left the cave, convinced that they had slept just one night. When one of them, whom they had sent to the city, tried to pay for food with the coins from the epoch of Decius, the shopkeeper thought that they had found a hoard of old money. The bp. of the city, however, having investigated the matter, understood that a great miracle had happened. The young men then fell asleep again, this time for good. There is also the mention of the heresy, that became known in the same period, of Theodore bp. of Aegae, who denied the bodily resurrection of the dead. The Sleepers of Ephesus’s awakening ‘proved’ that Theodore was wrong, thus giving a clue to the function of the Legend.</p>
<p>In Ephesus soon the cult of the Sleepers of Ephesus developed, and a church devoted to them, as a pilgrim’s narrative attests (Theodosius the Archdeacon, ‘De situ terrae sanctae’, between 518 and 530), was built there (it was discovered by the German archeological expedition in the 1930s).</p>
<p>The Legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus develops the old topic of a long sleep, which can be found already in the ‘Rest of the Words of Jeremiah’, 5:1 (2nd cent. AD) where Abimelek the ‘Ethiopian’ (i.e. African) falls asleep for the period of the Babylonian exile of the Jews, a topic also known from the Babylonian Talmud (Taʿanit 23; 2nd cent. AD), where it is told that one Honi Ha-Meʿaggel slept for the same period.</p>
<p>The Legend was originally, as it seems, composed in Greek. It soon became quite popular, and was translated into a number of languages: Latin (first attested by Gregory of Tours, 538–594) and from this into West European vernaculars, including French (poem by Chardri, 13th cent.), and in Eastern Christianity into Syriac, Armenian, Coptic, Arabic, Ethiopic, and <ref type="cr">Sogdian</ref>. It is also known in the sphere of Islam, as it appears in the Qurʾān (18:8–30). Consequently there came into being several Muslim versions, including those in languages such as Persian, Kyrgyz, and Tatar. The existence of all these versions stimulated the popular cult of the Sleepers of Ephesus in several places in addition to Ephesus, both in the Latin West and in the Muslim East.</p>
<p>In Syriac the Legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus is perhaps first attested by the ms. Saint-Petersburg no. 4 of the 5th cent., if M. van Esbroeck’s dating is accepted, and then by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, who devoted to it a <i>memrā</i>, written at the beginning of the 6th cent. (ed. Guidi, ‘Testi orientali’, two versions, 358–63, 363–9). This includes all the elements known from the later prose texts. Still in the 6th cent. it found its way into historiographic works such as the Ecclesiastical History of <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>of Mitylene (d. after 569), from whom <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> has a fragment in his Chronicle (ca. 1198), and <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History (not extant, but copied by Pseudo-Dionysios of Tel Maḥre, in the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>, ca. 775). There is, however, also an independent transmission, as for instance, in the mss. of London, Paris, and Berlin, edited by I. Guidi (1884) and A. Allgeier (1916–18). The earliest of them (if not Peterburgensis) would be London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,650, of the 6th–7th cent. There are some differences between the Syriac witnesses, one of them being the number of the young martyrs: seven in the oldest witnesses (Yaʿqub of Serugh and Pseudo-Zacharias) and in Michael Rabo, but eight in all the other texts.</p>
<p>The original language of the text was the object of a discussion for several years. Some scholars (including Th. Nöldeke 1886, 453–54) believed that the original was composed in Syriac. This was also the opinion of Allgeier (1916–18). His claim was criticised by Paul Peeters (1923), who showed that the original must have been Greek.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus was also known in the West in the Middle Ages, appearing for the first time in Gregory of Tours’s <i>(Liber) In Gloria martyrum</i>, ch. 38 (ed. B. Krusch [Monumenta Germaniae Historica, IV/A; 1885], 94), where he says that he had it from ‘a certain Syrian translator’ (<i>Syro quidam interpretante</i>). Although the presence of the Syrians in Gaul in the epoch is documented, it is not certain that Gregory really heard the Legend from a Syrian, as the term <i>Syrus</i> was applied in the epoch to all the foreigners of Levantine origin, including Greek-speaking ones, and therefore his version was most probably derived from a Greek text (Peeters, 141–2).</p>
<p>The feast of the Sleepers of Ephesus is not fixed and according to various calendars of the Syr. Orth. Church it is celebrated on 21 April, 2 and 13 August, and 23 or 24 October (ed. F. Nau, <i>Un martyrologe et douze ménologes syriaques</i> [PO 10.1; 1915]; ed. [with FT] P. Peeters, ‘Le Martyrologe de Rabban Sliba’, <i>AB</i> 27 [1908], 166).</p>

<p>Independent self-taught scholars. These twin sisters were born on 16 April 1843 at Irvine, Ayrshire. Both were widowed early on in their marriages, and devoted much of the rest of their lives to scholarship. They wrote under their married names, A. S. Lewis and 
M. D. Gibson. Agnes was concerned primarily with Syriac, publishing many new texts in the series Studia Sinaitica (1–12; 1894–1907), while Margaret concentrated more on Christian Arabic texts, which she published in Horae Semiticae (1–11; 1903–16), though she also edited and translated the <ref type="cr">Didascalia</ref> (1903) and <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>’s Commentaries on the Gospels and Acts. Thus Agnes provided the Catalogue of the Syriac mss. at <ref type="cr">St. Catherine’s Monastery</ref> (1894), and Margaret that for the Arabic ones (1894). (Impressed by their knowledge of Modern Greek, the Librarian gave them access to the mss.) Among Agnes’ important editions are <i>Select Narratives of Holy Women</i> (1900), representing the upper text of the ‘Sinaiticus’ ms. of the <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Version</ref>of the Gospels, <i>Apocrypha Syriaca</i> (1902), and several <ref type="cr">Christian Palestinian Aramaic</ref> texts, both biblical and hagiographical. Together the two sisters edited the Palestinian Syriac Lectionary (1899) and a collection of Christian Palestinian Aramaic palimpsest fragments from Geniza mss. (1900). The mss. they acquired in Cairo were left to Westminster College, Cambridge.</p>

<Author>G. A. Kiraz</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Sogdian
</LemmaTitle><p>The Sogdian language belongs to the Eastern subgroup of the Iranian languages. Its core area was Central Asia, in the region surrounding Samarqand and Bukhara, where it was native to the bulk of the population throughout the first millennium AD. For many centuries, Sogdian merchants controlled the central part of the Silk Road and extended their influence far beyond the area of their original habitation. Numerous Buddhist, Manichean, and Christian texts in Sogdian illustrate the religious diversity in Central Asia and western <ref type="cr">China</ref> in the period before the Islamization of the area.</p>
<p>The absolute majority of all Christian texts known to us in Sogdian transmission stems from the ruins of a Christian monastery at Bulayıq in the Silk Road oasis of <ref type="cr">Turfan</ref> (now in Xinjiang, China). Found <i>in situ</i> by the Second German Turfan Expedition in 1905, they are now kept in Berlin as part of the German Turfan Collection. These texts are written in a variety of the Syriac Esṭrangela script, with the addition of three supplementary letters for the phonemes /f/, /χ/, and /ʒ/. This writing system was not used for recording Buddhist or Manichean texts, and therefore it is usually referred to as the Christian Sogdian script. Its orthography reflects quite faithfully the phonetic structure of Late Sogdian and does not display the archaizing features of other Sogdian scripts. The bulk of the available Christian Sogdian manuscripts appear to have been written in the 9th and 10th cent., when Sogdian was likely the lingua franca of the Bulayıq Christian community.</p>
<p>The content of the Bulayıq library indicates that Sogdian Christians belonged to the Ch. of E., which is otherwise known for its missionary activity along the Silk Road. Besides non-denominational compositions, such as Gospel readings, psalms, and lives of early saints, one finds there numerous texts that are particular to Syriac Christianity, such as the life of <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Dailam</ref>, a verse homily ‘On the final evil hour’ by <ref type="cr">Babai of Nisibis</ref>, or <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref>’s Commentaries on <ref type="cr">Isaiah of Scetis</ref>. There is no evidence for indigenous Sogdian Christian literature, while all the identified texts of foreign origin appear, with one exception, to have been translated from Syriac. A large number of Syriac manuscripts have, in fact, been excavated at Bulayıq (see <ref type="cr">Syriac texts from Turfan</ref>), among which are some Sogdian and Syriac bilinguals. In addition, the same site yielded a smaller number of Old Turkic manuscripts, presumably from its terminal phase, and isolated texts in Middle and New Persian. The preparation of the catalogue of texts found at Bulayıq constitutes the main objective of a current SOAS research project <i>The Christian Library from Turfan</i>.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Bulayıq Sogdian was mutually intelligible with the other known varieties of the Sogdian language. Its peculiar feature, however, is a large number of technical terms of Syriac origin, e.g. <i>ks</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ ‘chalice’, <i>mdbḥ</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ ‘altar’, <i>šmš</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ ‘deacon’. The Syriac nouns are normally borrowed in the emphatic state and then inflected as Sogdian <i>ā</i>-stems. By contrast, Buddhist or Manichean Sogdian compositions do not contain any common nouns of undisputed Syriac origin.</p>
<p>No Sogdian texts of Christian content are available from the Sogdian heartland, although Syriac inscriptions are found in the Sogdian archaeological contexts in Urgut (Uzbekistan) and Panjakent (Tajikistan). One Sogdian inscription with Syriac loanwords is found in Kyrgyzstan. The Sogdian finds from the ‘Caves of the Thousand Buddhas’ in the Silk Road Oasis of Dunhuang include a small fragment of a Christian oracle book and several secular texts mentioning local Christians.</p>

<p><ab type="infobox"/>The Odes of Solomon consist of 42 short lyric poems, of which the Syriac version is preserved almost complete, while Ode 11 is also known in Greek, and five Odes in Coptic (including 1, lost in Syriac). At least some of them seem to have been composed in Greek. The editio princeps was by J. R. Harris in 1909 (2nd ed. 1911, after F. C. Burkitt had discovered a second, even more incomplete ms.). In both Syriac mss., H and N, the Odes of Solomon are followed by the 18  Psalms of Solomon. It should be noted that one and the same Syriac term (viz. <i>zmirtā</i>) is used for both, ‘Ode’ and ‘Psalm’. Before the discovery of the Syriac texts of Odes of Solomon 3–42 (H) and 17–42 respectively (N, sometimes labelled B) our knowledge of these enigmatic poems (also described as hymns, psalms, and songs) was restricted to the Latin quotation of Solomon’s ‘ode’ 19.6–7a by Lactantius (early 4th cent.), the listing of ‘Psalms and Odes of Solomon’ as OT <i>antilegomena</i> in the so-called ‘Synopsis’ of Pseudo-Athanasius (7th cent.) and the ‘Stichometria’ ascribed to Nikephoros (8th–
9th cent.), and the Coptic version of Solomon’s ‘odes’ 1, 5, 6, 22, and 25 quoted in the Gnostic work ‘Pistis Sophia’ (3rd cent.; <i>Codex</i> A, 4th cent.). These five pieces were taken from a Greek collection in which the Odes of Solomon were preceded, not followed, by the Psalms of Solomon. In 1959 the Greek text of Ode 11 was published by M. Testuz (<i>Papyrus Bodmer</i>, XI [3rd–
4th cent.]). In the Syriac version of this very ode we find the only verse (viz. 11.23a) which has left a clear trace in Syriac literature (cf. Ephrem, ‘On Paradise’, 7.21). The author(s), date, and place of origin are unknown. It is, however, probable that the anonymous odes later attributed to Solomon were composed and used by gnosticising Christians in bilingual Syria as early as the 
2nd cent. In form and content they appear to be strongly influenced by biblical language and show some connection with texts from Qumran. The Saviour is also called Lord, Son, and Messiah, but never appears under the name of Jesus. Dominant theological terms are Spirit, God, Lord, Most High, and Father. Among the most important soteriological concepts are grace, joy, knowledge, life, light, love, rest, truth, and word.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Sṭephanos bar Ṣudayli</head><ab type="infobox"/>(6th cent.)<LemmaTitle></LemmaTitle>
<p>Monk in the early 6th cent. to whom pantheist ideas were attributed; likely author of the ‘Book of the holy Hierotheos’. Our earliest evidence on Sṭephanos is a letter written to him by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>. Albeit on a friendly tone, Yaʿqub cautions against dreams and nightly visions and refutes the idea that punishment in the hereafter would not be eternal. Much harsher is <ref type="cr">Philoxenos</ref>, bp. of Mabbug, who between 512 and 518 wrote about Sṭephanos to two priests in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, Abraham and Orestes, who had been in touch with Sṭephanos. They are strongly warned against Sṭephanos’s evil influence. Philoxenos portrays Stephanos as a heretic, who equates the creation with God: adopting the allegedly Jewish idea of a thousand-year rest (symbolized by the Sabbath, which comes after the sixth day, symbol of this world), he assumes that everything will come to one consummation and will be of one nature with God on the first (i.e. the eighth) day. Philoxenos also notes that Sṭephanos, who left Edessa to live near <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>, had once been a follower of ‘John the Egyptian’ (whose identity cannot be established) and that he had borrowed the concept of ‘motion’ (<i>mettziʿānutā</i>), applied to the sixth day, from the ‘monk Evagrius’, i.e. <ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>. A few further details on Sṭephanos and on Philoxenos’s actions against him are provided in the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, in the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of 1234</ref>, and in <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref><ab type="infobox"/>’s Chronicle.</p>
<p>That Sṭephanos is the author of the pseudepigraphic ‘Book of the holy Hierotheos’ is explicitly stated by the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref type="cr">Quryaqos</ref> (793–817). The ‘Book’, originally written in Syriac, indeed reflects several of the ideas that Philoxenos attributed to Sṭephanos. It deals with the ascent of the mind towards God and with the final process of unification, whereby everything becomes one being. The author’s revelations are presented as being secret, and accessible only to the initiated.</p>
<p>While some ideas in the ‘Book’ ultimately go back to Origen, scholars have demonstrated the ‘Book’s’ dependence on the writings of Evagrius of Pontus, whose ideas, as expressed in the ‘Kephalaia Gnostica’, were interpreted in the direction of a radical pantheism. In addition, the attribution to Hierotheos links the ‘Book’ to the corpus attributed to <ref type="cr">Dionysius the Areopagite</ref>, who is said to have been a student of Hierotheos. This twofold orientation has led some scholars to assume two layers in the redaction history of the ‘Book’: a first layer, which is Evagrian, and a slightly later one, which responds and makes additions to the Pseudo-Dionysian writings. While Sṭephanos in all likelihood is the author of the first layer (not yet attributed to Hierotheos), the second layer may be the work of his pupils, who used the popularity of the Pseudo-Dionysian writings to promote their master’s teachings.</p>
<p>In spite of the controversy about its authorship, the ‘Book’ enjoyed popularity in the Syr. Orth. Church. Commentaries on it were written by Patr. <ref type="cr">Theodosios</ref> (887–896) and later by Bar ʿEbroyo; they were intended to reinterpret the work in accordance with the teachings of the Church. Mostly combined with either one of the commentaries, or with both, and thus domesticated, the ‘Book’ exists in more than 20 mss. Read through the lens of the two later commentaries or from the vantage point of two of its main sources of inspiration, the ‘Book’ may not yet have received sufficient attention as an authentic expression of early 6th-cent. Syr. Christian spirituality in its own right.</p>

<p>Protestant theologian; scholar of Syriac and Near-Eastern studies. Born on 23 Feb. 1907 in Dortmund, Strothmann studied theology and Near-Eastern languages at the universities of Giessen, Tübingen, Halle, and Göttingen. In 1931 he graduated in theology from Göttingen and received the Ph.D. degree from Tübingen with studies on the Arabic tradition of the writings attributed to the monk Makarios. After having worked at the Septuagint project in Göttingen between 1931 and 1934, he served as a Lutheran pastor near Braunschweig between 1934 and 1962. From 1958 onwards, he held a teaching position in Syriac Church History at the Theological Faculty of Göttingen University. At the same university, he received his Habilitation in 1964 with a study on <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>. In 1965, he was appointed professor in Syriac Church History. He tirelessly worked in this field until his death, on 19 June 1996, in Göttingen.</p>
<p>During his years at Göttingen, Strothmann’s focus was on Syriac studies, which he was able to promote vigorously in Germany and to which he attracted a great number of students. He founded the Göttinger Ar­beitskreis für syrische Kirchengeschichte, which already in 1968 published the so-called ‘Lagarde-Schrift’, a volume that commemorated the Syriac work of 
<ref type="cr">P. A. de Lagarde</ref>. In 1971, he organized the first Syriac Conference at Reinhausen, near Göttingen, which was attended by ca. 40 Syriac scholars as well as by the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius Yaʿqub III</ref>. Not only did this meeting strengthen the collaboration between Western scholars and the churches of the Syr. tradition, it also gave the impetus for the international <ref type="cr">Syriac Conferences</ref> that subsequently were held every four years, starting in Rome in 1972 (‘Symposium Syriacum’).</p>
<p>Strothmann initiated a large-scale project on the ‘Religious and cultural history of the Near and Middle East’, which was funded by the German Research Council and which, among other things, involved the creation of the series ‘Göttinger Orientforschungen’, with a sub-series ‘Syriaca’ (which includes more than 30 volumes, the majority of which were authored by Strothmann himself). Since Strothmann was primarily a philologist, with a particular interest in Syriac mss. and texts, many of the volumes contain text editions, written with a Syriac typewriter that was developed in the Netherlands. Within the framework of the Göttingen project, he was also instrumental in creating the multi-volume concordance of the Syr. OT, to which he himself contributed a great deal of work. This project made use of newly emerging computer technology (see <ref type="cr">Computing, Syriac</ref>).</p>

<p>The term Sureth (\< <i>surā</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>ith</i> ‘in Syriac’) refers to a number of North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic dialects spoken by E. Syrians in North Iraq, especially in the villages of the <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> plain. The use for literary purposes of what is seemingly a <i>koine</i> based on the <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref> (and <ref type="cr">Telkepe</ref>?) dialects has been attested since the end of the 16th cent. Later on, 19th and 20th cent. Sureth texts exhibit dialectal features of other districts, such as the mountain villages on the Iraqi-Turkish border or the town of Mosul. The ms. transmission of Sureth texts is characterized by phonetic spelling, unlike the rather historico-etymological standard in use for <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref> Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian). The earliest attested texts are religious poems belonging to the <ref type="cr">dorekthā</ref> genre. Wedding songs in Sureth (<i>zmeryāthā d-rāwe</i>) have been recorded in written form by European and Assyrian scholars. Spoken or literary varieties of Sureth are also known as Felliḥi, Iraqi koine, Modern Syriac, Neo-Syriac, Vernacular Syriac.</p>

<Author>A. Mengozzi</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>al-Suryān, Dayr</head><ab type="infobox"/>Monastery of the Syrians, Egypt [Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Monastery situated halfway between Cairo and Alexandria in the Wadi al-Natrun, ancient Scetis, Egypt. Today one of the flourishing monasteries of the Coptic Church, it derives its name from the earlier presence of a Syr. Orth. community. Whereas its foundation as an Egyptian monastery probably goes back to the 6th cent., the earliest evidence of the Syrian presence (in the first period mainly monks from <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref>) is from ca. 800. The Syrian presence came to an end, or lost its prominence, at the beginning of the 17th cent.; from then onwards the monastery has been entirely Coptic.</p>
<p>The main significance of Dayr al-Suryān for Syriac studies lies in the fact that it has preserved hundreds of ancient Syriac mss. From the early 18th cent. these began to be transferred to European libraries. A  number of mss. came to the Vatican Library; the bulk reached the British Museum, London, in the 19th cent. and are now at the British Library. The Monastery still holds a small collection (a catalogue is in preparation). The Dayr al-Suryān mss. include the earliest dated Syriac ms. (411), a great majority of all preserved pre-10th-century mss., and our main witnesses for the writings of important authors such as <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref>. No other place in the Middle East has yielded such a wealth of Syriac mss. The colophons of the mss. are the main source for our knowledge of the history of Dayr al-Suryān. Recent discoveries of murals, paintings as well as texts, in the Church of the Virgin provide additional information.</p>
<p>In an attempt to explain and justify the presence of the Syrians, three late notes in mss. — two of which can be dated to the 16th and 17th cent. — claim that Dayr al-Suryān was purchased by Tagritans at an unknown date through the intermediary of a certain Marutha. It is very unlikely, however, that a formal purchase ever took place. A recently discovered inscription indicates that Syrians were involved in the rebuilding of the Monastery in 818/19, after it had suffered damage. It must have been on that occasion that they started settling in. Even though a few decades later, the Monastery began to be referred to as ‘Monastery of the Syrians’, there is evidence that throughout the centuries Coptic and Syriac monks lived together.</p>
<p>A period of particular wealth was the first half of the 10th cent., when <ref type="cr">Mushe of Nisibis</ref> was abbot. Syriac inscriptions in the church bear witness to his building activities. To the collection of Syriac mss. he added 
250 volumes, which he brought back from a journey to Mesopotamia (927–31/32). In addition to the mss. imported from the Syro-Mesopotamian homeland, Syriac mss. were also produced in the Monastery itself.</p>
<p>The history of Dayr al-Suryān after the 10th cent. is less well known. There was a period of revival around 1200 and in the 13th cent., when new mss. were acquired and new wall paintings were produced. This is also the period to which a number of Coptic and Christian-Arabic mss. in Dayr al-Suryān can be dated. Towards the end of the 15th cent., an abbot of Lebanese origin, Quryaqos (Cyriacus, also known as Severos) gave a fresh impetus to the intellectual and cultural life in the Monastery. In 1516, 43 monks were living in Dayr al-Suryān, 18 Syrians and 25 Egyptians.</p>
<p>In the 18th cent., the Church of the Virgin was completely replastered, except for three semi-domes that continued to show their 13th-cent. paintings. It is only in 1995 that conservators and art historians began to remove parts of the plaster, thus allowing the earlier layers to reveal a wealth of paintings as well as texts in Greek, Coptic, Syriac, and Arabic.</p>

<p>Collection of reports and canons of the synods of the Ch. of E. held between the years 410 and 775/6. This collection of synods is only one part of a much larger collection of canonical and juridical texts, which is transmitted in a single 13th- or 14th-cent. ms. (Alqosh Syr. 169), accessible to Western scholars in a number of later copies. The larger collection has sometimes been called the ‘great Synodicon’ (‘Das grosse Synodikon’ in Selb’s description, consisting of 80 items, see p. 59–63). The more limited collection, the Synodicon Orientale proper, covers nos. 28–41 of Selb’s list. It is this more limited collection that has been edited by Chabot and translated by both Braun (GT) and Chabot (FT) under the title Synodicon Orientale. Within the ms. itself, the title ‘Book of synods’ (<i>Ktābā d-swnhdw</i>) is used a few times, either for the collection of E.-Syr. synods or, as a <i>pars pro toto</i>, for the entire collection. The collection of synods is specifically introduced with the term <i>swnhdyqw</i> (plur.) ‘synodical texts’ (Braun: ‘Synodalacten’; Chabot: ‘décisions synodales’).</p>
<p>Chabot divides the entire collection into three parts (covering 840 pages in the Borgia ms.). The part edited by him, the Synodicon Orientale proper, is the second (p. 242–561). The first part (p. 1–242; nos. 1–27 in Selb’s list) contains texts attributed to the apostles along with canons and related literature of the early Greek synods; it also includes the 73 pseudo-Nicene canons attributed to <ref type="cr">Marutha of Maypherqaṭ</ref>and some other texts relevant to the early history of the Ch. of E., such as the correspondence related to <ref type="cr">Papa bar ʿAggai</ref>. The third part (p. 561–840; nos. 42–80 in Selb’s list) contains additional materials pertaining to Cath. Mar <ref type="cr">Aba I</ref>and <ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ  II</ref>; extracts from Greek theological writings; the monastic canons of <ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref>and his successor Dadishoʿ on Mount Izla; the canons of the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>; several lawbooks associated with the names of cath. <ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ I</ref> (late 7th cent.), cath. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> (d.  823), cath. <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ</ref> <ref type="cr">bar</ref> <ref type="cr">Nun</ref> (d. 828), <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar

The presence, at the very end of the collection, of a concluding note under the name of cath. Eliya I, may suggest that the collection received its final redaction during his tenure (1028–49), even though the exact role of this note — in a damaged part of the original ms.  — and Eliya’s involvement in the collection have been debated (Kaufhold 1983, 727–30). Several items of the collection remain unpublished.</p>
<p>The second part of the collection, the Synodicon Orientale proper, contains reports of the synods, along with the canons (and in some cases confessions of faith, lists of signatures, and relevant letters), of the following synods: cath. <ref type="cr">Isḥaq</ref> (410); cath. <ref type="cr">Yahbalaha</ref> (420); cath. <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref> (424, no canons); cath. <ref type="cr">Aqaq</ref> (486, followed by a note on the 484 Synod of <ref type="cr">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref>, with a reference to letters by Barṣawma provided in an appendix); cath.

Aba I (544, followed by several documents); cath. <ref type="cr">Yawsep I</ref> (554); cath. <ref type="cr">Ḥazqiel</ref> (576); <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb I</ref> (585); cath. <ref type="cr">Sabrishoʿ I</ref> (596, no canons); cath. <ref type="cr">Grigor I</ref> (605); cath. <ref type="cr">Gewargis I</ref> (676, followed by an important theological letter); and cath. Ḥenanishoʿ II (775). There is reason to assume that this collection, focused on the synods between 410 and 775 (the Synodicon Orientale in the narrower sense), originated independently from the other documents of the larger collection. Given the time period covered, it is likely that it was put together ca. 800, possibly under the instigation of cath. Timotheos I, whose interest in matters of church legislation and canon law is well attested. This collection then became one of the main components of the larger collection, created at a later period in time. The Synodicon Orientale is an extremely valuable source for the study of the history and the theology (Brock) of the Ch. of E. in the Sasanian and early Islamic period, even if the later redactors may occasionally have updated the terminology or introduced minor changes, according to their perspective (Fiey).</p>
<p>The textual transmission is based on a single ms.: Alqosh Syr. 169 (Vosté; or no. 90 in an earlier checklist by A. Scher), the writing of which seemed to Scher (who is followed by Vosté) to be ‘prior to the 14th cent.’. This ms. presently is kept in the Monastery of the Chaldeans in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> (Ms. 509; cf. Kaufhold 2005, 230). Mgr. Joseph David brought a 19th-cent. copy to Rome in 1869. This two-volume copy became ms. Museo Borgiano 
K. VI, 4 and 3, and was later incorporated into the Vatican Library as Borg. Syr. 82 and 81. Among the first scholars to study it was I. Guidi (1889), followed by 
O. Braun. The latter prepared a German translation of the second part of the collection (Synodicon Orientale), which appeared in 1900. J.-B. Chabot, while he was planning an edition of the same part, was able to use a second copy of the Alqosh ms., which subsequently became ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 332 (dated 1895). This contains the Synodicon Orientale only, not the larger collection. 
A number of other copies, complete or incomplete, exist (Selb, 64–6 and Kaufhold 1983, 730–1). While for the Synodicon Orientale no other mss. beyond ms. Alqosh Syr. 169 and its descendants are extant, for a number of the sections of the larger collection additional mss. are available or a parallel transmission exists in an Arabic collection under the name of Īlīyā al-Jawharī (ca. 900) and in <ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref>’s <i>Fiqh al-Naṣrāniyya</i> (Kaufhold 1976, 24–5).</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The elevation in 1656 of Andrew Akhījān (d. 1677) as Catholic bp. of <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> and then as Patr. in 1662 was the first major attempt to create a ‘Syriac Catholic’ branch out of the Syr. Orth. Church of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. This attempt was short-lived but when the Syr. Orth. bp. of Aleppo Michael Jarweh (d. 1800) and four other bishops professed the Catholic faith in 1782 in <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, a durable Catholic Church was established. Thereafter, numerous communities in Syria, Turkey, Iraq, and Palestine joined the Uniate movement, and an unbroken line of successors followed Patriarch Jarweh. Among these prelates are the liturgist Jirjis V Shalḥat (d. 1891), the learned <ref type="cr">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref>, (d. 1929), Cardinal <ref type="cr">Gabriel Tappuni</ref>(d.  1968), and lately Cardinal Mūsā I Dāʾūd, former Prefect of the Congregation of Eastern Churches. In 1930 in India, a group within the Syr. Orth. Church of Malabar joined the Roman Catholic Church. The <ref type="cr">Malankara Catholic Church</ref> that emerged shares with the Syriac Catholic Church its liturgy but they differ in that the former is Archiepiscopal while the latter is patriarchal. The Church currently consists of 3 eparchies (<ref type="cr">Beirut</ref> [patriarchal], Cairo, USA-Canada), 6 archdioceses (<ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>, Aleppo, <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref>-Nabk, Hasaka-<ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>), 4 patriarchal eparchies (Turkey, <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>-Holy Land, Baṣra-Gulf, Venezuela), 4 missions (France, Sweden, Australia, Brazil), and 1 patriarchal procuracy (Rome). The patriarchal seat is in Beirut, where the cyclical synods of the Church take place. There too is the Monastery of <ref type="cr">Sharfeh</ref>, which not only contains a precious collection of mss. and a press, but also includes the Church’s main seminary. The Church owns other monasteries as well, including <ref type="cr">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref> in Syria, which contains famous medieval wall paintings, and the 12th-cent. <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Behnam</ref> in Iraq, an architectural jewel and a true museum of lapidary art. Syr. Catholic monastic and priestly communities include the Ephremite nuns in Lebanon, an ascetic community in Dayr Mār Mūsā in Syria, and the ‘Priests of Jesus the King’ in Iraq, a group that promotes priestly communal life.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The first international Syriac conference took place in 1972 in Rome under the title ‘Symposium Syriacum’ (papers published in OCA 197, 1974), thus providing the name for succeeding international Syriac conferences, which take place every four years in different locations: <i>SymSyr</i> [II] in Paris, 1976 (OCA 205, 1978); <i>SymSyr</i> III in Goslar (Germany), 1980 (OCA 221, 1983); <i>SymSyr</i> IV near Groningen, 1984 (OCA 229, 1987); <i>SymSyr</i> V in Leuven, 1988 (OCA 236, 1990); <i>SymSyr</i> VI in Cambridge (GB), 1992 (OCA 247, 1994); <i>SymSyr</i> VII in Uppsala, 1996 (OCA 256, 1998); <i>SymSyr</i> VIII in Sydney, 2000 (<i>JEastCS</i> 46, 2004); <i>SymSyr</i> IX in Kaslik/Beirut, 2004 (<i>ParOr</i> 31, 33, 2006, 2008); <i>SymSyr</i> X in Cordoba, 2008. From 1980 onwards, these conferences have been held in conjunction with ones on Christian Arabic (published separately). International Syriac Conferences have also been held (normally even four years) since 1987 at the St. Ephrem Ecumenical Research Institute (SEERI) in Kottayam (Kerala, India).</p>
<p>Besides these international meetings a number of different regular regional conferences have grown up. Notable among these are two series in Lebanon: the Symposium Syro-Arabicum: I, [Kaslik] 1995 (<i>ParOr</i> 20–2, 
1995–7); II, 1998 (<i>ParOr</i> 27–8, 2002–3); and the (mostly) annual conferences on specific themes, entitled Patrimoine Syriaque. The first of these latter was held in 1993 in Antelias, and the proceedings of each are published by the Centre d’études et des recherches orientales (CERO, Antelias). In N. Iraq and Turkey a series of conferences on the Syriac language have been held, with the papers from the 4th (Mardin, 2008) published in Nuhadra/Duhok, 2009.</p>
<p>In Europe, a Deutsches Syrologen-Symposium has been held annually since 1998 (most are published in Studien zur Ostkirchengeschichte, ed. M.  Tamcke); also in Germany and elsewhere the <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref> community has organised a number of conferences of an academic nature. The annual conferences of the French Societé d’études syriaques (since 2003) are devoted each year to a specific topic, with the papers published in the series Études syriaques (1–, 2004–). In Italy, an annual series of meetings, entitled Incontro sull’Oriente Cristiano di tradizione siriaca, has been taking place in Milan since 2002, with the proceedings for each edited by E. Vergani and S. Chialà. A series of occasional Peshitta Symposia, organised by the Peshitta Institute, Leiden, is held at irregular intervals since 1985, the proceedings being published in the Peshitta Institute’s Monograph Series (MPIL).</p>
<p>The First North American Syriac Symposium was held at Brown University (Providence, RI) in 1991, and it has since been followed by meetings every four years in different locations: Catholic University of America in 1995 (Washington D.C.), University of Notre Dame in 1999 (Notre Dame, IN), Princeton Theological Seminary in 2003 (Princeton, NJ; see E.  Aydin, in <i>Hugoye</i>6.2 [2003]); University of Toronto in 2007 (Toronto, Canada; see G. A. Kiraz, in <i>JCSSS</i>7 [2007], 103–4), and Duke University scheduled for 2011 (Durham, NC). In addition to the North American Syriac Symposium, the Dorushe Annual Graduate Student Conference on Syriac studies has met every spring at different universities since 2006: Catholic University of America in 2006 (Washington D.C.; see J.-N. Saint-Laurent, in <i>Hugoye</i>9.2 [2006]), Princeton University in 2007 (Princeton, NJ), University of Notre Dame in 2008 (Notre Dame, IN), and Yale University in 2009 (New Haven, CT; see A. M. Butts, in <i>Henoch</i>31.2 [2009], 460–62). In Toronto, the Canadian Society for Syriac Studies has held annual conferences and smaller meetings since 2000, the main papers of which are published in the <i>JCSSS</i> (2001–). Beth Mardutho has held a number of <ref type="cr">computing</ref> forums in conjunction with other conferences.</p>
<p>Besides these series of conferences, an impressive number of other academic conferences, usually on specific topics, have begun to take place in recent years, such as that in Stockholm (2006), on <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, organised by Syrianska-Arameiska Akademiker Föreningen, and that in Aleppo (2008), on <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, organised by the Syrian Orthodox Archbishopric.</p>
<Author>S. P. Brock and A. M. Butts</Author><LemmaTitle>Syriac Language</LemmaTitle> 
<p>Syriac, the self-designations of which are <i>suryāyā</i>, <i>ārāmāyā</i>, and <i>urhā</i><i>yā</i>, is a dialect of the <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> language branch, which is itself a member of the larger Semitic language family. Syriac is generally grouped in the late Aramaic period (ca. 200–1200) despite the fact that it is attested from the 1st cent. AD to the present. Though previously considered an East-Aramaic dialect, some evidence suggests that Syriac should be classified as a separate branch of late Aramaic that is distinct both from East-Aramaic, which includes Mandaic and Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, and from West-Aramaic, which includes <ref type="cr">Christian Palestinian Aramaic</ref>, Samaritan Aramaic, and Jewish Palestinian Aramaic. In comparison to other late Aramaic dialects, Syriac preserves many features of earlier ‘Standard Literary Aramaic’.</p>
<p>Syriac is by far the best documented Aramaic dialect. Based on the designation <i>urhāyā</i> ‘(the language) of Edessa’, it is likely that Syriac originated in or around <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. As the primary language of Syriac Christianity, it spread over much of Mesopotamia and Syria reaching as far as Ethiopia, India, and Central Asia. Syriac is first found in non-Christian tomb <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref> that date from the 1st to the 3rd cent. These inscriptions display a number of archaic features — some of which also occur in early mss. — that were lost in the standardization of classical Syriac. The majority of Syriac literature stems from the Christian communities that emerged in Mesopotamia and Northern Syria starting in the 2nd cent. AD. The ‘Golden Age’ of Syriac spanned from the 4th to the 7th cent. and produced a considerable corpus of original prose and poetry as well as translations from Greek. After the Islamic conquests in the 7th cent., Syriac was gradually replaced by Arabic though it lived on for several centuries and even witnessed a brief renaissance in the 12th and 13th cent. (see <ref type="cr">Syriac Renaissance</ref>). Alongside the numerous Neo-Aramaic dialects (see Aramaic, <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ṭuroyo</ref>), classical Syriac still functions today as a liturgical and literary language for Syr. Christians both in the Middle East and the worldwide <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref> (see <ref type="cr">Kthobonoyo Syriac</ref>). In addition to the large surviving literary corpus related to Syriac Christianity, Syriac is attested in incantation bowls, amulets, inscriptions, and documentary texts written on <ref type="cr">papyrus</ref> and parchment (for the latter, see <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Documents</ref>).</p>
<p>After the Christological controversies in the 5th and 6th cent., Syriac split into an E.-Syr. and W.-Syr. tradition. The differences between these traditions appear primarily in <ref type="cr">script</ref> and phonology. While the Esṭrangela script continued in restricted use in both traditions, the W.-Syr. tradition adopted Serṭo as its primary script, and the E.-Syr. tradition developed a new script based on Esṭrangela. In phonology, the E.-Syr. tradition employs a seven vowel system, which more closely reflects earlier stages of Aramaic. In the W.-Syr. tradition, however, several vowel changes occurred, e.g. the shifts of *<i>ā</i> to <i>o</i>, *<i>ē</i> to <i>i</i>, and *<i>o</i> to <i>u</i>.</p>
<p>Like all Aramaic dialects, Syriac throughout its long history has been in contact with other languages. In addition to inheriting a number of Akkadian and Persian loanwords from earlier periods of Aramaic, Syriac borrowed lexemes from Middle Persian, Hebrew, and  — later in its history — Arabic. The language that had the most significant impact on Syriac, however, is Greek. Greek influence is found in texts from the earliest period, such as the ‘Book of the Laws of the Countries’ (see <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>) and the <ref type="cr">Odes of Solomon</ref>, and reached its apex in the 5th through 7th cent. when the translation movements were in progress (see <ref type="cr">Greek, Syriac translations from</ref>). This close contact with Greek had an effect on Syriac not only in its vocabulary where many Greek loanwords are found, but also in syntax and even morphology.</p>
<p>Syriac has enjoyed a long tradition of academic study in Syriac-speaking communities. <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (d. 708) is traditionally considered the first author of a Syriac grammar. Although this work does not survive in its entirety, portions of it were incorporated into the so-called Syriac <ref type="cr">Masora</ref> (<i>mašlmānutā</i>). This important compilation also contains vocalized texts of the OT, NT, and patristic authors, which serve as a rich source of philological and grammatical material. As is the case with so many of the sciences in Syriac, the grammatical tradition was codified by the polymath <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (d. 1286), who wrote both a small metrical grammar and a much larger opus entitled ‘The Book of Splendors’ (<i>ktobo d-ṣemḥe</i>). Syriac-speaking communities also produced works on <ref type="cr">lexicography</ref>, the most well-known of which are the Syriac-Arabic dictionaries of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿAli</ref> (second half of the 9th cent.) and of <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref> (fl. 10th cent.).</p>
<p>The study of Syriac in the West, which began in the 16th cent., culminated at the turn of the 20th cent. with the publication of the grammar of <ref type="cr">Th. Nöldeke</ref> (1880; 2nd ed. 1898; ET in 1904) and the lexica of <ref type="cr">R. Payne Smith</ref> (1879–1901), <ref type="cr">C. Brockelmann</ref> (1895; 2nd ed. 1928; ET in 2009 by Sokoloff), and <ref type="cr">T. Audo</ref> (1897), all of which remain standard reference works today. In addition to the grammar of Nöldeke, detailed grammars of Syriac are available in Arayathinal (1957–9) and, more recently, Muraoka (2005). The most common Syriac dictionary for students is <ref type="cr">J. Payne Smith</ref> (1903); M. Sokoloff (2009) has also recently provided an English translation (with correction, expansion, and update) of Brockelmann’s <i>Lexicon</i>. Elementary grammars of Syriac include Coakley (2002), Healey (2005), and Thackston (1999). Useful <ref type="cr">bibliographies</ref> for the study of the Syriac language can be found in Albert (1993), Muraoka (2005), and Brock (2006).</p>

<Author>A. M. Butts</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Syriac Lexicography
</LemmaTitle><p>Despite widespread translation activity and the use of Syr. in Late Antiquity by numerous non-native speakers, there are no surviving Syr. lexical materials from this early period, with the exception of two 4th-cent. Manichaean Syr.-Coptic glossaries written on wooden boards, found in the kitchen of an abandoned house at Kellis in the Dakhla Oasis of Egypt (Franzmann and Gardner). These were produced by the translator of a Syr. text into Coptic, and so the order of the Syr. words is determined by their occurrence in the source text. It is likely that similar glossaries will have been produced by other Syr. translators, and particularly in the 7th cent. when formal one-to-one Greek to Syr. correspondences were common, but these have not survived.</p>
<p>Lexical works of a different kind were produced by the Syr. scribal schools, whose careful transmission of biblical and patristic texts led to the production of a ‘masoretic’ literature that is comparable in many respects to that of contemporary Jewish scribes (see <ref type="cr">Masora</ref>). Some texts preserve the correct pronunciation of rare words or foreign names, others provide lists of homographs. These lists are often included within grammatical texts, mainly of Ch. of E. origin, and are associated with such figures as <ref type="cr">Yawsep Huzaya</ref> (6th cent.), <ref type="cr">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref> (mid–7th cent.; see Hoffmann 1880 with Gottheil 1887, 61*–67*; 1889), <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (d. 828), <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref>(809–73; see Hoffmann 1880 with Gottheil 1887, 61*–67*; 1889), Abdochus (12th cent.), <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (1225–86; see Martin), and <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (d. 1318).</p>
<p>The first real Syr. lexica, containing alphabetic lists of words and their glosses, were produced in 9th-cent. Abbasid <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> by professional translators of Greek scientific texts into Syr. and Arabic, rather than monastic scribes, and were often focused on explaining Greek technical loan-words in Syr., and other rare vocabulary, rather than listing all Syr. lexemes. One of the first of these was Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq’s <i>Puššāq</i><i>šmāhe yawnāye 
b-suryāye</i> ‘The interpretation of Greek words with Syriac’. In addition to his work on Greek words and his work on Syriac homographs, Ḥunayn is said to have written a ‘Compendious Lexicon’ (Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 3.1, 165). Hunayn’s lexicographical works were augmented by <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ of Merv</ref> (who may or may not be the same person as Zekarya of Merv), and this was in turn re-edited by one of Ḥunayn’s students, <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar ʿAli</ref>, and in this Syr.-Arabic form it still survives (Hoffmann 1874; Gottheil 1910, 1928).</p>
<p>The largest of all these early Syr.-Arabic lexica (often more like an encyclopedia than a dictionary), and the most useful for scholars today, is that of<ref type="cr"> Ḥaṣan</ref> <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>, who lived in Baghdad in the mid-10th cent. (Duval 1888–1901). He cites many earlier lexical sources, one of the most important of which was <ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ bar Seroshway</ref>, bp. of <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref> ca. 900. This lexicon was widely copied by both E.-Syr. and W.-Syr. scribes until the 20th cent., and they continued to add entries and citations and to edit older entries in line with their own theology and christology. One adaptation of Bar Bahlul and Bar ʿAli even has the Arabic replaced with Armenian in Syriac <ref type="cr">script</ref>, possibly for the Syr. Orth. of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> who spoke an Armenian dialect (Margoliouth 1898; see also <ref type="cr">Armenian Christianity, Syriac contacts with</ref>). Duval’s great edition of this work is not a critical edition of the earliest form of the work (probably irretrievable) but is largely based on W.-Syr. manuscripts containing the fullest form of the lexicon, and so includes, for example, references to the 13th-cent. Bar ʿEbroyo.</p>
<p>An alternative type of medieval Syr.-Arabic lexicon is ‘The Book of the Interpreter’ of <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (975  –  ca. 1050), which is divided into 30 lessons, in which Syr. vocabulary is listed according to subject categories, such as names of God, human attributes, parts of the body, trades and professions, minerals, colors (de Lagarde 1879).</p>
<p>With the beginning of Syriac printing in Europe in the 16th cent., there was a growing demand for Syr.-
Latin lexica. The first of these was the <i>Syrorum peculium</i> of <ref type="cr">Andreas Masius</ref> (1571), included in the sixth volume of the Antwerp Polyglot Bible, which like many early European Syr. lexica mostly contained Syr. vocabulary from the NT, with some OT additions. More widely used than Masius’ work was the frequently reprinted <i>Lexicon pentaglotton</i> of Valentino Schindler (1612) and the NT lexica of Johann Buxtorf the younger (1622), Martin Trost (1623), Aegidius Gutbier (1667), and Carl Schaaf (1708). Castell’s <i>Lexicon Heptaglotton</i> (1669), which was printed to accompany Walton’s London Polyglot Bible, was the first to incorporate all the Syr. of the OT as well as to make systematic use of the medieval Syr.-Arabic lexica. Michaelis extracted the Syr. vocabulary from Castell and republished it in 1788, and this became the standard Syr. lexicon in the early-19th cent., although much criticised.</p>
<p>The late-19th cent. saw the production of numerous major Syr. lexica which remain key reference works today (although they pre-date most critical editions of Syr. texts). The largest was the <i>Thesaurus syriacus</i> (1868–1901) of <ref type="cr">Robert Payne Smith</ref>, which built upon the unpublished lexical mss. of numerous European colleagues, especially Quatremère and Bernstein, and middle-eastern lexica, both the medieval texts mentioned above and the 1619 lexicon of the Maronite George Karmsedinoyo, and contains numerous citations, as well as proper names. Smith was assisted by his daughter <ref type="cr">Jessie</ref> <ref type="cr">Payne Smith</ref>, who also compiled a supplement and the standard Syr.-English dictionary (published 1896–1903). <ref type="cr">Carl Brockelmann</ref>, a student of <ref type="cr">Theodor</ref> <ref type="cr">Nöldeke</ref>, published an excellent Syr.-Latin hand-lexicon (1894–5; 2nd ed. 1923–28) which includes some rare vocabulary not found in the work of the Smiths, and has now been translated into English and expanded by Sokoloff. Very important Syr. lexica printed in the middle-east include that of <ref type="cr">Toma Audo</ref> (1897, 1901) which contains a very great number of old Syr. forms not found in the European lexica, and so to a lesser extent the Syr.-Arabic lexicon of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqob Awgen Manna</ref> (1900). Notable 20th-cent. lexica include the Syr.-Arabic-French hand-lexicon (1963) of <ref type="cr">Louis Costaz</ref>, and the Syr.-English-Malayalam lexicon of Emmanuel Thelly (1999), which makes good use of Audo.</p>
<p>The world-wide <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref> of Syr.-using Christians, and the arrival of Syr. word-processing software, has produced an explosion of Syr. lexica in recent decades. These are notable for including Classical Syr. neologisms for modern ideological and technological terminology, and some particularly useful examples were published by Hanna and Bulut (2000), Khoshaba and Youkhana (2000), and Afram (2005).</p>
<p>Although Christian Neo-Aramaic was included in Payne Smith’s <i>Thesaurus</i>, the first dedicated dictionary was the Assyrian-Russian work of Kalashev (1894), soon followed by the important Assyrian-English dictionary of Maclean (1901). Large lexica of the Christian NENA dialects were later published by David (1924), Sarmas (1969, 1980), and Sargizi (2002), and less comprehensive lexica of <ref type="cr">Ṭuroyo</ref> by Ritter (1979), Jacob and Asmar (1985), and Ishaq (1988).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Syriac Orthodox Church</LemmaTitle> 
<p>It is one of the Oriental Orthodox Churches who accept the councils of Nicea, Constantinople, and Ephesus, but reject Chalcedon. Its liturgical language is Syriac, though translations of liturgical texts into local languages are permitted. The Church traces its roots to the apostolic episcopal traditions of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. In the 6th cent., it had a distinct line of patriarchs who resided outside of Antioch in various locations in the Near East until they settled, more or less, in <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> near <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> during the 13th cent. After the massacres known as <ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref>, the patriarchate was transferred to <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref>in 1933, and later to <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref> in 1957. Now, the patriarch resides at Maʿarrat Ṣaydnāyā. Since 1293 its patriarchs adopted the name Ignatius, after the 2nd-cent. bp. of Antioch. The current Patr. is Ignatius Zakka I. The church is divided into (arch)dioceses, each headed by a bp. or archbishop who is under the jurisdiction of the Patr. and accountable to the Holy Synod. Some archdioceses are ‘patriarchal vicarates’; the patriarchal vicar, regardless of ecclesiastical office, is accountable directly to the Patr. The local head of the church in Malankara is the <ref type="cr">Maphrian</ref> (or Catholicos) who is under the jurisdiction of the Patr. and is accountable to the Holy Synod and to the local Malankara Synod. He is consecrated by the Patr. and presides over the local Holy Synod. The Church has been a member of the World Council of Churches since 1960 and is one of the founding members of the Middle East Council of Churches. The Church has issued two joint declarations with the Roman Catholic Church and another with the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch (see <ref type="cr">Ecumenical Dialogue</ref>). There are 400,000 to 500,000 adherents dispersed in the Middle East, Europe, the Americas, and Australia, in addition to ca. one million in India. The Church is sometimes known by the misleading and not acceptable names Jacobite and Monophysite (the term Miaphysite is acceptable).</p>

<Author>G. A. Kiraz</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Syro-Hexapla 
</LemmaTitle><p>A rendering into Syriac of the Septuagint column of Origen’s Hexapla. The Greek Christian writer and biblical scholar Origen (ca. 185 – ca. 253) created the text-critical tool known as the Hexapla in order to recover the ‘original’ Greek of the Septuagint. The Hexapla was a six-columned synopsis of Scripture, giving the Hebrew text word by word, lined up with a Greek transcription and four Greek translations, namely the Septuagint and the three later Jewish versions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. Origen marked up the fifth, Septuagint, column with text-critical signs to indicate where material had been added or omitted in comparison with the current Hebrew text used by the rabbis (which Origen assumed was identical with the text from which the Septuagint had been translated).</p>
<p>The Hexapla must have been too vast to copy in its entirety, and the original, which was created and kept in Caesarea, may have perished during the Persian or Arab invasions of the mid–7th cent. Only a few folios of Psalms remain, and these date from the 9th and 10th cent. Since the focus of the Hexapla itself was on the Septuagint column, it was this which was copied separately along with its critical signs, and eventually even the latter were omitted from most Greek mss. This Hexaplaric Septuagint column was also translated literally into Syriac by <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Tella</ref> in 616–17 and supplemented with short readings from the other Greek versions. The Syro-Hexapla is of particular value for scholars, because it has preserved the text–critical signs as well as fragments from the later Jewish Greek versions. For theological and geographical reasons, it was much more influential among W. Syrians than in the Ch. of E., though it seems to have been ‘rediscovered’ by <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> (see Braun) and was certainly used by the 9th-cent. 
E.-Syr. scholar <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> in his biblical commentaries (see Van Eynde, XXII–XXV). It was an influence on <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>’s revision of the OT, and individual readings have sometimes crept into later <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> mss.</p>

<p>Tagrit is a modern city located on the west bank of the Tigris, almost mid-way between <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> and <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>. While the early history of Christianity in this city and its region is shrouded in mystery, by the late 5th cent., there is evidence of a local E.-Syr. community. By the mid-6th  cent., Tagrit had become a W.-Syr. stronghold headed by ‘metropolitans’ representing the Syr. Orth. patriarchs of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> in Sasanian and Islamic Iraq and further east. Three such leaders left monumental churches on the citadel of Tagrit or outside of it: <ref type="cr">Aḥudemmeh</ref>, the first Metropolitan (559–75), <ref type="cr">Marutha</ref> the ‘Great Metropolitan’ (629–49), who not only built the Great Church of the citadel but is also said to have opened the city to the Arab invaders, and Metropolitan Bar Ishoʿ, who, between 669 and 683, built the Church of Sergius and Bacchus recently excavated by Iraqi archaeologists. Fortress-like monasteries were also known to Tagrit. The monumental one recently uncovered in the nearby site of <i>al-Kanīsa</i> ‘The Church’, contained coins dated as late as 1225, and offered wall paintings, graves of abbots buried along with their crosses and staffs, and Syriac <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref> and records of such metropolitans as Yuḥanon bar Kipho (d. 688), Yawsep I (d.  778), and Athanasios I (d. 903). The 9th–11th cent. period, the Golden Age of Christian Tagrit, witnessed the rise of such great authors as the theologian and apologist Ḥabīb b. Khidmā Abū Rāʾita (fl. 828), <ref type="cr">Anṭun of Tagrit</ref> (9th cent.), and the brilliant translator and ‘dialectician’ <ref type="cr">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (d. 974). Trade was a major occupation of Tagritans, some of whom (it was later claimed) purchased in the early 9th cent. a Coptic monastery in the Scetis desert (Egypt), filling it with rare mss. and embellishing it with beautiful wall paintings. The monastery named after the Mother of God became known as the ‘The Monastery of the Syrians’ (<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>). Pressure by the Muslim majority resulted in the shift of the metropolitan seat from Tagrit to Mosul in 1156, by which time its metropolitans were called maphrians. After the fall of Baghdad at the hands of the Mongols in 1258, Tagrit little by little lost its Christian population, and the latter deserted the city altogether by the 15th cent.</p>

He witnessed in this city the genocide perpetrated against the Christians by the Ottoman Turks (see <ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref>) and worked heroically to alleviate the suffering and misery endured by them until he was himself caught in the middle. He was imprisoned in June 1918 and was freed in Oct. of the same year after the intervention of the Vatican and the Empress Zita of Austria. Tappuni was appointed patriarchal vicar in <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> in 1919, then archbishop of the same city in 1921. He was elected patr. of the Syr. Cath. Church on 17 June 1929, residing in <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref> rather than in Mardin. He was made Cardinal in 1935, the first Syriac ever, and participated in the election of three popes in the Conclaves of 1939, 1958, and 1963. At the Second Vatican Council he was a member of the presidential council, the first Middle-Easterner in this position. Cardinal Tappuni was a builder, erecting churches in Aleppo (St. Ephrem), a patriarchal palace, a seminary (<ref type="cr">Sharfeh</ref>), and two schools in Beirut, and other churches elsewhere. He was also a great administrator, promoting solid priestly education in Sharfeh and founding a religious order for women (the Ephremite sisters), for which he built a large convent in Beirut. He was honored with medals by many European and Arab countries and was a close friend of General Charles De Gaulle. At the national and Arab levels, he was heeded by the Lebanese presidents of his time and by Arab heads of states and ministers.

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Tatian</head><ab type="infobox"/>(ca. 120 – ca. 185) 
<p>Apologist, teacher, composer of the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref>. A well-born pagan born in ‘Assyria’ (which might mean either Syria or Assyria), Tatian was interested in finding a ‘true’ philosophy. Passing through many schools, he eventually converted to Christianity and ended up in Rome, probably about 150. There he became a student of Justin Martyr and eventually had his own school. After Justin’s death (which occurred between 163 and 167), Tatian was expelled from the primitive Roman community for heresy; <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref> dates this separation to 172. Irenaeus lists three reasons: Tatian 1. was arrogant in his role as a teacher; 2. became a follower of Valentinus’s gnostic teachings; and 3. espoused Encratism. <ref type="cr">Epiphanius</ref> provides us with our last glimpse of Tatian, reporting that he returned to the East, founded a school in Mesopotamia, and had influence in Cilicia, Antioch on the Orontes, and Pisidia.</p>
<p>In antiquity Tatian was famed as an apologist. Only one of his apologetic works survives, the ‘Oration to the Greeks’. Divided into two parts, the first is a vitriolic indictment of everything Greek; the second is a chronology whose purpose is to demonstrate that Moses antedated Homer. Both Clement of Alexandria and Eusebius praise the ‘Oration’ and its chronology. Today, however, Tatian is famed as the creator (or compiler) of the Diatessaron (Greek <i>dia-tessaron</i> ‘through [the] four [Gospels]’), a gospel harmony widely used in the early Eastern — especially Syr. — Church. Although based on sources written in Greek, the Diatessaron appears to have been composed in Syriac. It is regarded as the first Syriac translation of the Gospels. Known in the Syrian world by either its transliterated Greek name or as the <i>ewangeliyon da-mḥallṭe</i> (‘the Gospel of the mixed’), it was apparently the standard gospel in the Syriac Church until at least the early 5th cent. This is apparent not only from explicit references to its liturgical use (in the <ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref> and Bp. <ref type="cr">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref>’s ‘Compendium of heresies’, I.20), but also the insistence of Bp. <ref type="cr">Rabbula of Edessa</ref> (‘Canon’, 43) on the use of the <i>ewangeliyon da-mparrše</i> (‘the Gospel of the separated’) in churches. Many of the harmonizations found in the <ref type="cr">Old Syriac Version</ref> (the Sinaitic Syriac and the Curetonian Syriac) and  — to a lesser degree — even in the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>, seem to originate in the Diatessaron. The preeminence of the Diatessaron in the early Syriac Church cannot be minimized: <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref> seems to quote it, and <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> composed a commentary on it. As late as the 9th cent., Bp. <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> cited its readings in his Gospel commentaries. Its importance for critical historical studies is also of the first order: it has long been used by scholars for reconstructing the oldest strata of gospel traditions and the shape of the canon in the 2nd cent.</p>
<p>Probably because of the high esteem accorded the Diatessaron in the East, early Eastern reports concerning Tatian are positive. He is even accorded an almost mystical understanding of the divine intent behind the Gospels because of his skill in harmonizing parallel passages. Only after the time of <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (ca. 1275) do we find Eastern sources unambiguously describing Tatian as a heretic, something the West had done since Irenaeus (ca. 185).</p>
<p>Tatians’s known <i>oeuvre</i> includes: 1. ‘Oration to the Greeks’ (ed. Markovich; ed. Whittaker; ed. Schwartz); 
2. Diatessaron (for the numerous editions of the many witnesses in many languages, see Petersen); 3. ‘Problems’ lost.; 4. ‘On animals’ lost; 5. ‘On perfection according to the Savior’ lost; 6. ‘To those who have propounded ideas about God’ reported as a planned treatise; whether ever written is unknown.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>An organization for the support and welfare of Syr. Orth. orphanages and schools, popularly known by the Syriac acronym Taw Mim Simkath (English T.M.S.) which originally referred to Ottoman Turkish <i>Terakkiyât-ı Mekteb-i Süryânî</i> (perhaps influenced by the Ottoman <i>İ</i><i>ttihâd ve Terraki Cemiyeti</i> ‘Committee of Union and Progress’), and later Arabic <i>taraqqī al-madāris al-suryāniyya</i> ‘Progress of Syriac Schools’ (much later the somewhat awkward Syriac <i>tdareg madršotho suryoyotho</i> was coined). It was charted under the English name <i>Assyrian National School Association of America, Inc.</i>, and sometime between 1949 and 1968 was renamed <i>The Assyrian Orphanage and School Association of America, Inc.</i>, its current official name, but it remains popularly known by <i>Taw Mim Simkath</i>. Its inception was on 8 Oct. 1889 when eleven individuals, originally from Diyarbakır (<ref type="cr">Amid</ref>), met in Sterling, New Jersey. They each agreed on an initiation fee of $1 (= $26.78 in 2008) and a weekly pledge of five cents (= $1.34 in 2008), but did not have a specific purpose or name. On 25 March 1900, a meeting was held where new members joined, one of whom was Gabriel Boyajy, a new arrival from Diyarbakır. He suggested a name and purpose: opening a school in Diyarbakır when finances permitted. It was around this time that an initial Constitution and By-laws were drawn up. By 1908, the organization had grown with several branches at College Point (Long Island, New York), Paterson, and Sterling, resulting in a need for an executive Board of Trustees, which then incorporated the organization in the State of New Jersey, with a Constitution drafted by Gabriel Boyajy. In the aftermath of the 1915 <ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref> massacres, the members changed their focus from supporting education just in Diyarbakır to general education support. In 1919, an orphanage was established in Adana, Turkey, in cooperation with the French High Commissioner. There <ref type="cr">Dolabani</ref> taught Syriac to what would become a new generation of modern writers. After a short period of three years, the French High Commissioner withdrew support and planned to move the orphans to Paris. Instead, T.M.S., in cooperation with the community in <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref> Lebanon, moved the children to Beirut in 1923 and then built a small complex in Khandaq al-Ghamīq and transferred the orphanage there in 1926. In 1973, the school was moved to Burj Ḥammūd where it remains. By T.M.S.’s Golden Jubilee in 1949, about 160 students had graduated from the orphanage, some of whom became luminaries in modern Syriac literature including <ref type="cr">Fawlos Gabriel</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ghaṭṭās Maqdisī Elias</ref>, <ref type="cr">George Danhash</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Ḥanna Salmān</ref>. Currently, the school has 312 students and 20 teachers. T.M.S. purchased Syriac metal types in 1921, and a <ref type="cr">printing</ref> press in 1923 to support the publication of the periodical <i>Beth Nahrin</i>. T.M.S. continues to hold an annual event to support the school in Lebanon as well as other schools and orphanages. It is based in Paramus, New Jersey.</p>

<p>Town 15 km. north of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, it is a populous Chald. settlement, seat of a bishopric., with a conspicuous <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref> in Iraq (Mosul, <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>, Baṣra, etc.) as well as in the USA, especially in San Diego and Detroit. Ecclesiastic sources give a population of around 900 Chald. families living in Telkepe in 1961. Economy is traditionally based on agriculture, periodically suffering drought and parasites. Excavation is not allowed in a graveyard on the tell that might cover an Assyrian citadel. The name of Telkepe is mentioned in 8th-cent. Arabic sources. Other early information is scarce and uncertain. The village was plundered by Murād Bey (Bar Yak) in 1508. From the 17th cent. Telkepe was one of the centers promoting union with Rome. A Belgian missionary reports that in 1653 the Patr. had left his ordinary residence in the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Rabban Hormizd</ref> under the pressure of continuous Kurdish attacks and took refuge in Telkepe. The same missionary complains that there were so many priests for such a small village that they were reduced to the level of cowherds. In 1743 the Persians of Nādir Shāh, unable to conquer Mosul, plundered Telkepe and other villages in the plain. By the end of the 18th  cent. Telkepe is described as entirely Chald., but in the 2nd  half of the 19th cent. the clergy of the village went through a troublesome period of division and rivalry. As late as 1890 Budge met a ‘Nestorian’ party in Telkepe. Many influential Chaldeans were born in Telkepe, including: <ref type="cr">Yawsep</ref>  <ref type="cr">II</ref>, the second Chald. Patr. and prolific author (b.  1667), the fine <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref> poets (<ref type="cr">Yawsep of Telkepe</ref>, 17th cent.; Toma Tektek Sindjari and Yawsep ʿAzarya, both 19th cent.), the poetess Anne of Telkepe (alive in 1914), and the much-debated ‘princess’ Mary Therese Asmar (1804, 
d. Paris ca. 1870). As a result of the arabization policy of 1980–1990, Telkepe now has an Arab majority.</p>

<p>The Monastery of Tell ʿAda, also known as the ‘Great Monastery’, is located just over 48 km. from <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>; 1500 m. north of the present village of Tell ʿAda. At its apogee (5th–9th cent.) Tell ʿAda was a vibrant center for W.-Syr. monasticism. Tell ʿAda is thought to have been founded by the monk Ammianos and his disciple Eusebios in the mid-4th cent. Monks from Tell ʿAda were instrumental in the founding of other Syr. Orth. monasteries, such as the neighboring Monastery of Eusebona. Tell ʿAda occupied a prominent place in the Syr. Orth. Church from its founding through the 10th cent., after which little else is known.</p>
<p>The 5th-cent. writer <ref type="cr">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref> appears to have spent some time in this monastery. In his ‘History of the Monks of Syria’ (ch. 4) he describes a large community of monks at Tell ʿAda, a community that was already spreading out to found other monasteries. One surviving 6th-cent. ms., written in this monastery’s scriptorium, contains a collection of poetry from <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Antioch</ref>. Some letters to Tell ʿAda also survive. The 6th-cent. Syr. Orth. bp. <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> addressed a well-known letter to the monks of Tell ʿAda (ed. Guidi 1884). Another letter purporting to be from <ref type="cr">Basil</ref> the Cappadocian appears in an early 6th-cent. ms. (ed. Albert).</p>
<p>Tell ʿAda is famous as the last residence of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> and the place where he undertook his revision of the Old Testament. According to <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, Yaʿqub resided here during the last nine years of his life before he was asked to return to his bishopric. After living in Edessa for four months, Yaʿqub traveled to Tell ʿAda in order to retrieve his books. It was there that illness overcame Yaʿqub and he died on 5 June 708. A marginal note by Yaʿqub in his revision of the Cathedral Homilies of <ref type="cr">Severus</ref> discloses his familiarity with the region of Tell ʿAda and the neighboring Monastery of Mar Eusebona (Hom. 30, PO 36.4, 617).</p>
<p>The ruins of Tell ʿAda have been dated by Tchalenko to the 5th cent., although it is recognized that the foundation of this monastery may date back to the mid-4th cent. A number of Syriac <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref> from Tell ʿAda still exist. One of the later inscriptions, dated 941/2, refers to patr. <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan V bar Abgare</ref>.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>The Testament of Adam is one of a considerable number of ‘apocryphal’ books dealing with Adam; though its roots lie in Jewish traditions, it is definitely a Christian composition, and was probably composed in Syriac, where it is attested in three recensions. It consists of three parts, the ‘Horarium’ on the hours of the night and day at which different parts of creation offer praise to God; the prophecies of Adam, foretelling the flood, the birth, passion, and death of Christ, and the end of the world (these are recorded by Seth and buried in the ‘cave of treasures’); and an account of the hierarchy of angels. The ‘Horarium’ is found in Greek, but this was probably translated from the Syriac third recension. The whole work is also known in Arabic, Ethiopic, and Georgian; in all these it is incorporated into the <ref type="cr">Cave of Treasures</ref>. According to Samuel of Ani (12th cent.) it was translated into Armenian by ‘Nestorians’ in the late 6th cent., but only the ‘Horarium’ survives of this. Excerpts are also found in Coptic. The date of the work (Robinson suggests 3rd cent.), and the nature of its relationship to the Cave of Treasures, remain unclear.</p>

<p>A collection in two books of church regulations claiming to be from the mouth of Christ and written down by <ref type="cr">Clement of Rome</ref>. The work (<i>CPG</i> 1743) was originally written in Greek (of this only parts survive); Cappadocia, Syria, and Palestine (thus Kohlbacher) have all been suggested as its place of origin; Rahmani dated it to the 2nd cent. but more recently the late 4th (White) and the late 5th cent. (Kohlbacher) have both been suggested. The translation into Syriac was made in 686/7 by ‘the poor Yaʿqub’ who is usually identified as <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>. The work contains three different elements: a short apocalypse at the beginning; material going back to the ‘Apostolic Tradition’ attributed to <ref type="cr">Hippolytus</ref>; and descriptions of liturgical usage (including a complete initiation rite [II.5–10], as well as a number of prayers for different occasions). The third element may portray an ideal rather than any local reality. The apocalypse was perhaps added and composed by the translator (thus Drijvers). The Testament was taken over in an abbreviated form in the Syr. Orth. ‘Synodicon’ in ms. Damascus Patr. 8/11. In Arabic and Ethiopic it forms part of the ‘Octateuch of Clement’.</p>

<p>Abū al-Ḥasan Thābit b. Qurra b. Marwān al-Ṣābī al-Ḥarrānī, the most famous of the ‘Ṣābian’ scholars from the Abbasid period, is one of the few non-Christian authors known by name who composed works in Syriac. Thābit was born in <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>, where he is said in some accounts to have worked as a money changer, but spent most of his active life in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>, where he studied under Muḥammad b. Mūsā b. Shākir and his brothers, the Banū Mūsā, and went on to succeed them as the head of their school. Trilingual in Greek, Syriac and Arabic, Thābit distinguished himself both as a translator of Greek scientific and philosophical works into Arabic and as an original scholar, especially in mathematics and astronomy.</p>
<p>Thābit wrote most of his works in Arabic, but also composed a number of works, apparently mostly on religious subjects, in Syriac. In al-Zawzanī’s epitome of <i>Taʾ<i>rīkh al-hukamā</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ</i>, the Arabic biographical work by al-Qifṭī (ca. 1172–1248), we are given a list of seven treatises on religious subjects which Thābit composed in Syriac, and are told in addition that there were further Syriac works by Thābit, including those on music and geometry (ed. Lippert, 120.14–21). Similarly, <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, after telling us that Thābit wrote some 150 works on ‘logic, mathematics, astrology, and medicine’ in Arabic, gives us a list of sixteen works composed by Thābit in Syriac, and informs us furthermore that he himself had access to a majority (<i>suggā</i>) of them (Chronicle, ed. Bedjan, 168.11–23). The titles given by Bar ‘Ebroyo are: ‘(1) book concerning the laws and canons of the pagans (<i>ḥanpe</i>); (2) book concerning the interment of the dead; (3) book concerning the confirmation of the confession of the pagans; (4) book on purity and defilement; (5) book on animals which are fit to be sacrificed; (6) book on times of prayers; (7) book on readings that are suitable for each of the seven stars in prayers; (8) book on repentance and supplication; (9) book of music; (10) book of the chronicle of the ancient Syrian kings, who are Chaldeans; (11) book on the confession of the Ṣābians; (12) book on the allotment of the days of the week to the seven stars; (13) book on the renown of his race and his forefathers, from whom they descend; (14) book of the laws of Hermes and his prayers with which the pagans pray; (15) book on the fact that two straight lines meet each other when they are made to go out at less than two right angles; (16) another book on the same subject’ (on the Arabic version of nos. 15 and 16, see Sabra). Bar ʿEbroyo goes on to quote from a work of Thābit (perhaps no. 13) what may be called a <i>plaidoyer</i> for paganism and pagan learning (ed. Bedjan, 168.25–169.10). One quotation in Bar ʿEbroyo’s grammatical work, the ‘Book of splendors’, which is stated to be from the ‘book of the pagans’ (ed. Moberg, 39.6f.), may be taken from a work of Thābit. Further information on Ṣābian religious practices gleaned from Thābit’s works is given by Bar ʿEbroyo in his ‘Epitome of the history of the dynasties’ (<i>Mukhtaṣar ta</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>rīkh al-duwal</i>, ed.

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Theano
</LemmaTitle><p>Pythagorean philosopher, usually considered to be either the wife or the daughter of Pythagoras (d. 497/6 BC). Several writings in Greek and Syriac are attributed to Theano. The Greek texts consist of nine sayings, seven letters, and a fragment from a work ‘On Piety’ (<i>Peri eusebeias</i>). Their date is difficult to determine: the letters may be of a 2nd to 5th cent. date, whereas the sayings and the fragment may represent an earlier tradition. The Syriac texts consist of a collection of 65 sayings, entitled ‘Advice of Theano’ (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,658), other isolated sayings, and a passage of Pseudo-Nonnus’s ‘Mythological Scholia on <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>’ (ed. Brock). The Syriac texts focus on themes of general ethical advice, such as charity, friendship, avoidance of anger, inner freedom, and the pursuit of virtue rather than wealth. Unlike similar <i>gnomologia</i> (such as the ‘<ref type="cr">Sentences of Sextus</ref>’), the ‘Advice of Theano’ has not undergone a Christian redaction. This collection may date from the 3rd cent. The Syriac texts are translations from the Greek, but their original is not among the extant Greek fragments. The content of the Syriac Theano tradition, however, resembles certain sections of the Greek tradition. Moreover, there are similarities between the Syriac sayings and other Pythagorean gnomologia.</p>

<p>Raised as a child acrobat in the circus, Theodora married the future emperor Justinian I in 523. Upon the death of his uncle Justin I in 527, the couple ascended the throne together. An empress of immensely strong character, Theodora was known for her sympathetic support for the dissenting Miaphysite Christians, persecuted under Justin I and Justinian in their campaigns on behalf of a Chalcedonian imperial orthodoxy. To the exiled church leaders and monks, Theodora provided financial help and protection. She also housed the exiled patriarchs in the imperial palace of Hormisdas in Constantinople during the extensive but ultimately fruitless theological debates sponsored by Justinian. 
She supported the missionary activities of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref> and Theodore of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, during which the foundations of a separated Oriental Orthodox church were laid, and particularly the nascent Syr. Orth. Church. She remains a revered figure among the Syr. Orth. to this day.</p>
<p>The most important evidence for Theodora’s life and activities comes from two writers who knew her personally: the notoriously scathing portrait of the Greek historian Procopius in his ‘Anecdota’ and the sympathetic depiction offered by the Syr. bp. and historian <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> in both his ‘Lives of the Eastern Saints’ and his Ecclesiastical History. Subsequent W.-Syr. tradition transformed her story into a hagiographical romance, claiming she was the chaste daughter of a Miaphysite priest from Mabbug (or Kallinikos), whom Justinian met while on military campaign in the east and married against the will of her father. She is the subject of a play in Arabic by Pawlos Behnam (translated into Syriac by <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon Dolabani</ref>).</p>

<Author>S. A. Harvey</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Theodore of Mopsuestia</head><ab type="infobox"/>(ca. 350–428) 
<p>Bp. of Mopsuestia, biblical commentator, author of theological works and homilies. Little is known of Theodore’s early years, except that he studied with the pagan rhetor Libanius in <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> and probably knew <ref type="cr">Diodore of Tarsus</ref> and <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref>. That he wavered from his ascetic endeavors and needed to be rebuked by John Chrysostom rests entirely on the identification of Theodore with the addressee of John’s letter ‘To the fallen Theodore’, an identification Theodore’s later opponents were eager to make, but for which there is very little evidence. In 392 Theodore became bp. of Mopsuestia, north of Antioch, a position that he held until his death in 428. He died in peace with the Church.</p>
<p>Following the deposition of <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref> at the Council of Ephesus (431), Theodore began to be seen as the originator of Nestorianism. <ref type="cr">Rabbula</ref>, bp. of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> and follower of <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, anathematized Theodore’s works in 432 and ordered them to be burned. Although Theodore was somewhat rehabilitated when at the Council of Chalcedon (451) <ref type="cr">Hiba</ref>’s letter to Mari the Persian was read, which spoke about Theodore in positive terms, later he again was targeted for his allegedly Nestorian views, which eventually led to his condemnation at the Fifth Ecumenical Council at Constantinople (553).</p>
<p>Theodore’s works started being translated into Syriac perhaps even during his life, or shortly after his death. They became very popular in Edessa, in particular at the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref>, even though the followers of bp. Rabbula (d. 435) strongly rejected them. They had a decisive influence on those theologians who in the second half of the 5th cent. left Edessa and founded a new School in <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, within the Persian Empire. The theology of the late–5th-cent. councils of the Ch. of E. primarily reflects the views of Theodore. He saw a clear distinction between the divine and human natures in Christ: the Word of God indwelt the assumed Man, whereby the two came together in one ‘person’ (Greek <i>prosōpon</i>, Syr. <i>parṣopā</i>), serving as one object of veneration. In his biblical interpretation Theodore, a major representative of the so-called School of Antioch, saw the biblical text primarily in its historical context. Only rarely, and under strict conditions, was he willing to admit NT references or Christological typologies within the OT. His main interpretative framework was God’s salvation plan, seen as a process of education throughout history, leading up to the NT realities and the hereafter, whereby each individual phase is respected in its own right. Theodore rejected the idea of double meanings in the biblical message, which he saw as the major shortcoming of allegorical interpretation, which he connected with Philo of Alexandria and Origen.</p>
<p>While only small portions of Theodore’s works survive in Greek (with the exception of the commentary on the Twelve Prophets, which survives in its entirety), E.-Syr. tradition has preserved a collection of 16 catechetical homilies (ed. Tonneau and Devreesse), biblical commentaries dealing with both OT and NT (ed. Sachau, Vosté, Tonneau, Jansma, and Van Rompay), and a disputation with the followers of Macedonius (ed. Nau). One major theological work, on the Incarnation, existed in the library of Msgr. <ref type="cr">Addai Scher</ref> in <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>, Turkey, but it was lost during the First World War. Excerpts and quotations from many more of Theodore’s works can be found in a great number of E.-Syr. writings, while he is a much quoted authority in all E.-Syr. biblical commentaries, often introduced with the simple term <i>mpaššqānā</i>, i.e., the Interpreter. One of the Eucharistic Anaphoras in use in the Ch. of E. is attributed to him.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Theodoret of Cyrrhus</head><ab type="infobox"/>(393–466)
<p>Bp., biblical exegete, church historian, hagiographer, and defender of Antiochene Christology against <ref type="cr">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>. Born in <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> to a pious mother who took him regularly to visit monks in the outskirts of Antioch, in particular Peter the Galatian. Theodoret was made bp. of Cyrrhus (60 miles northeast of Antioch in the diocese of Hierapolis/Mabbug) in 423 and participated in the Council of Ephesus (431), defending <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref> against Cyril of Alexandria. Deposed by the Second Council at Ephesus (449), he was reinstated at Chalcedon (451).</p>
<p>Theodoret is the author of a number of biblical commentaries, an argument for the superiority of Christianity over paganism, a response to <ref type="cr">Eutyches</ref> against the miaphysite position, an Ecclesiastical History which continued <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref>’s chronicle to 428, and the ‘History of the Monks of Syria’ (<i>Historia Religiosa</i>).</p>
<p>The ‘History of the Monks of Syria’ is a collection of 30 brief to medium-length lives of ascetics in the region of Antioch from the early 4th to mid-5th cent., many with whom Theodoret had personal contact and interaction. The lives follow chronologically the course of Theodoret’s life. The first 20 lives are of ascetics who were deceased by the time of Theodoret’s writing; the last ten describe ascetics who were still living when he wrote. Also, the first 13 ascetics are located in the Antioch region, where Theodoret was raised and educated, while the latter 17 center around Cyrrhus, the locus of his episcopacy.</p>
<p>Theodoret portrays the ascetics in similar patterns with little character development, helping to create an image of Syriac Christianity dominated by severe asceticism. Yet, Theodoret depicts himself intervening with a number of ascetics in his role as bp. to mitigate the rigor of their asceticism.</p>
<p>Theodoret wrote all his works in classical Greek, but was fluent in Syriac evidenced by his many conversations with contemporary ascetics. In the life of Jacob of Cyrrhestica, a demon approaches and speaks to Theodoret in Syriac (21.15).</p>
<p>Noteworthy lives include: <ref type="cr">Yulyana Saba</ref> (2) — subject of a long <i>memrā</i> attributed to <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>; Peter the 
Galatian (9) — an ascetic who healed Theodoret’s mother and converted her to a more sober lifestyle; <ref type="cr">Maron</ref>  (16)  — the namesake of the founder of the Maronite community (<ref type="cr">Yuḥanon Maron</ref>); Jacob of ­Cyrrhestica   (21)  — 
the lengthiest written life and the first ascetic still living at the time of Theodoret’s writing; <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>  (26)  — the most celebrated of Theodoret’s figures. Two chapters concerning women ascetics are included at the end of the ‘History of the Monks of Syria’: Marana and Cyra (29) and Domnina  (30).</p>
<p>The ‘History of the Monks of Syria’ includes a prologue and an epilogue on divine love. The lives included are: 1. <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> (d. 337/8); 2. Yulyana Saba 
(d. 367); 3. Marcianus of Chalcis (d. 380s); 4. Eusebius of Tell ʿAda (fl. 350s); 5. Publius of Euphratesia (fl. 350s); 6. Symeon the Elder of Antioch (fl. 370s); 7. Palladius of Antioch (fl. 370s); 8. Aphrahaṭ of Antioch (d. ca. 410); 9. Peter of Mt. Silpius (d. ca. 403); 10. Theodosius of Cilicia (d. ca. 405); 11. Romanos of Mt. Silpius (d. ca. 400); 12. Zeno of Mt. Silpius (d. 410s); 13. Macedonius of Mt. Silpius (d. ca. 420); 14. Maesymas of Cyrrhus 
(fl. late 4th cent.); 15. Acepsimas of Cyrrhus (fl. late 
4th cent.); 16. Maron of Cyrrhus (d. 410s); 17. Abraham of Cyrrhus (d. 420s); 18. Eusebius of Asikha (d. 430s); 19. Salamanes by the Euphrates; 20. Maris of Cyrrhus 
(d. c. 430); 21. Jacob of Cyrrhestica; 22. Linneaeus of Cyrrhus; 23. John of Cyrrhus, Moses of Rama, Antonius; 24. Zebinas, Polychronius of Cyrrhus; 25. Asclepius of Cyrrhus, John of Nimouza; 26. Shemʿun the Stylite; 27. Baradatus of Antioch; 28. Thalelaeus of Gabala; 
29. Marana and Cyra of Beroea; 30. Domnina of Cyrrhus.</p>
<p>Three chapters from his ‘History of the Monks’ survive in Syriac translation (Yaʿqub of Nisibis, Yulyana Saba, and Abraham of <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>), and there are also fragments of a Syriac translation of his Ecclesiastical History (unpublished).</p>

<Author>R. A. Kitchen</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Theodoros Abū Qurra</head><ab type="infobox"/> (probably d. after 829) [Melk.]
<p>Author, bp. of <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>. Little is definitively known about the life of Theodoros Abū Qurra. He was likely born in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> toward the middle of the 8th cent. At an unknown date, he became bp. of Ḥarran. He is traditionally thought to have been a monk at the monastery of Mar Saba, though this has recently been called into question (see Lamoreaux 2002). In his Chronicle, <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>(d. 1199) reports that Abū Qurra was deposed from his see by Theodoret, the Melk. Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> (Chabot, <i>Chronique de Michel le Syrien</i>, vol. 3, 32–4 [FT]; vol. 4, 495–8 [Syr.]). The historicity of this has, however, also recently been challenged (see Lamoreaux 2005, xiii–xv). In the Chronicle of Michael Rabo, Abū Qurra is also said to have travelled to Armenia where he debated with the Syr. Orth. scholar <ref type="cr">Nonos of Nisibis</ref><LemmaTitle></LemmaTitle>(d. after 861) in the court of the Armenian prince Ashot Msaker 
(d. 826). This event, which occurred between 813 and 817, is corroborated by the writings of Ḥabīb b. Khidma Abū Rāʾiṭa (d. after 830), a relative of Nonos and the one who sent him to Armenia. Around the same time, Abū Qurra translated the pseudo-Aristotelian treatise <i>De virtutibus animae</i>into Arabic (ed. with GT Kellermann). In the anonymous <ref type="cr">Chronicle of 1234</ref>, it is reported that a debate took place in 829 between Abū Qurra and Caliph al-Maʾmūn 
(r. 813–33) (ed. J.-B. Chabot,<i> Anonymi auctoris Chronicon ad annum Christi 1234 pertinens</i>, II [CSCO 82; 1916], 22–3; FT A. Abouna and J.-M. Fiey, <i>Anonymi auctoris Chronicon ad A.C. 1234 pertinens</i>, II [CSCO 354; 1974], 15–6). A literary text purporting to be an account of this debate is preserved in a number of mss. (ed. Dick 1999; ed. with ET Bertaina 2007); its historicity is, however, disputed (see 
D. Bertaina, ‘The debate of Theodore Abū Qurra’, in <i>Christian-Muslim relations</i>, ed. Thomas and Roggema, 556–64).</p>
<p>Abū Qurra is among the first Christians known to have written in Arabic. According to his own testimony (Bacha 1904, 60–1; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 119), he also wrote in Syriac, though none of his Syriac works are known to survive. His works are extant in both Arabic and Greek as well as Georgian translations (for the latter, see Datiašvili). The textual tradition of these works is not, however, very well understood (a monograph is in preparation by J. C. Lamoreaux).</p>
<p>Abū Qurra’s works in Arabic are as follows (titles generally follow the abbreviated versions in Lamoreaux 2005): ‘On free will’ (ed. Bacha 1904, 9–22; ed. with IT Pizzo and Samir; GT Graf 1910, 223–38; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 195–206); ‘On the Trinity’ (ed. Bacha 1904, 23–47; GT Graf 1910, 133–60; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 175–93); ‘On the death of Christ’ (ed. Bacha 1904, 48–70; GT Graf 1910, 198–223; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 109–28); ‘On the confirmation of the Gospel’ (ed. Bacha 1904, 71–75; GT Graf 1910, 128–33; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 49–53); ‘On the method of the knowledge of God’ (ed. Bacha 1904, 75–82; GT Graf 1910, 160–8; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 157–64); an untitled work on salvation, three sections of which are extant (ed. Bacha 1904, 83–91, 180–186, 91–104; GT Graf 1910, 169–98; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 129–49); ‘Letter to David’ (ed. Bacha 1904, 104–
139; GT Graf 1910, 239–77); ‘Against the Jews’ (ed. Bacha 1904, 140–54; ed. with FT Bacha 1905; GT Graf 1910, 88–102; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 27–39); ‘On the councils’ (ed. Bacha 1904, 154–79; GT Graf 1910, 103–128; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 61–81); ‘Treatise on the veneration of the holy icons’ (ed. Dick 1986; GT Graf 1910, 278–333; ET Griffith 1997; IT Pizzo); ‘Treatise on the existence of the Creator and the true religion’ (ed. Dick 1982; GT Graf 1913; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 1–25, 41–7, 165–74 [who argues that this is actually three separate treatises]); ‘Confession of faith’ (ed. with FT Dick 1959, 56–62; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 151–4); ‘On the characteristics of the true religion’ (ed. with FT Dick 1959, 62–7; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 55–7); ‘Questions on free will’ (ed. with ET Griffith 1979; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 207–8); ‘Against the Armenians’ (ed. with ET Lamoreaux 1992; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 97–101). In addition, there are a number of unpublished works in Arabic (see Samir 1999, 433–36; 2005, 101–13; Lamoreaux 2009, 470–3).</p>
<p>The Greek works attributed to Abū Qurra are collected (with LT) in Migne’s <i>Patrologiae Graecae</i>, vol. 94, col. 1595–1598; vol. 97, col. 1445–1610. An ET of many of these is available in Lamoreaux 2005. Most of the Greek works against Islam have recently been re-edited with GT by Glei and Khoury. Some of these are not, however, by Abū Qurra, but rather are part of a collection of dialogues reported by John the Deacon (see Lamoreaux 2001). The authenticity of a number of the other Greek works attributed to Abū Qurra is also uncertain. Though there are several substantial treatises, most of the Greek works are fragments that probably belonged at one time to larger, now lost treatises. It is explicitly mentioned in the introduction to <i>Opusculum</i>4 that it was translated from Arabic by Michael Synkellos (<i>PG</i>, vol. 97, col. 1504; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 83). In addition, an Arabic precursor has been discovered for <i>Opusculum</i> 9 (see Griffith 1979). In addition to the published works, there are a dozen or so unpublished texts in Greek attributed to Abū Qurra; most of these are short though there is a more extensive refutation of Islam (see Lamo­reaux 2005, xxvi).</p>

<Author>A. M. Butts</Author><LemmaTitle>Theodoros bar Koni</head><ab type="infobox"/>(fl. end of the 8th cent.) 
[Ch. of E.]
<p>Author, who taught at the exegetical school of Kashkar. Though there has been some controversy in the scholarly literature concerning his dates, there now seems to be general consensus that Theodoros bar Koni completed his main literary work, the Scholion, in 792/3 (for discussion, with previous literature, see Griffith 1981, 161–4). Little else is known about his life. In his ‘Catalogue’, <CharStyle:Cross-reference>ʿAbdishoʿ attributes the following works to Bar Koni (Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 3, 198–9): 1. Scholion; 2. Ecclesiastical History; 3. treatises (<i>mallp</i><i>ānwāthā)</i>; 
4. funerary discourses (<i>buyyā</i><cTypeface:Italic>ʾ<i>e</i>). Only the first of these is known to survive. The Scholion exists in two recensions: the Siirt (ed. Scher; FT by Hespel and Draguet) and the Urmia (ed. with FT by Hespel [additions only]; the section on the ‘Pauline’ epistles was independently ed. with GT by Brade). The mss. of the Siirt recension are generally the earlier of the two, and the text of the Urmia recension is the longer. The two recensions also differ at times in their arrangement. Overall, the Urmia recension seems to represent a later version of the text that has been supplemented and expanded over time.</p>
<p>The Scholion is a manual or textbook of the theology of the Ch. of E. In its present form, it is composed of 11 <i>memre</i>. The 11th <i>memrā</i> and possibly also the 10th may, however, be later expansions (even if by Bar Koni, himself). The first nine <i>memre</i> are organized according to the biblical text. <i>Memre</i>1–5 treat the OT, whereas 6–9 treat the NT. These <i>memre</i>are not structured as a running commentary, but rather are in the form of questions and answers, a genre employed by other E.-Syr. exegetes, such as Bar Koni’s near contemporary <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (d. 828) (for this genre, see ter Haar Romeny). Interspersed between the questions and answers are lists of difficult words and phrases accompanied by explanations. Many of these words are technical expressions which may have no longer been understood by readers of the biblical text in the 8th cent.; in addition, the difficulty with a smaller group of these words may stem from the original translation of the OT where either the Hebrew was followed too closely (often calqued) or a neologism was created (see Salvesen). Bar Koni’s exegesis is based first and foremost on <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, the exegete <i>par excellence</i>of the E.-Syr. tradition. In Bar Koni’s words, the Scholion is intended for ‘those who are coming for the first time to a consideration of the reading of the commentaries of the blessed interpreter (i.e. Theodore)’ (Scher [CSCO 69], 231). In addition to Theodore, a variety of other authors are cited, including <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>and <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref> as well as Origen, <ref type="cr">Basil</ref> <ref type="cr">of Caesarea</ref>, <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, <ref type="cr">John</ref> <ref type="cr">Chrysostom</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</ref>. In a number of places, Bar Koni’s Scholion shows striking similarities to other E.-Syr. exegetical works, such as the ‘Selected Questions’ of Ishoʿ bar Nun, the Diyarbakır Commentary (ed. Van Rompay), and the Commentaries of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> (fl. ca. 850). The exact relationship between each of these works has not yet been entirely explained, though it has been shown that some if not all of these works had access to a common source and that Bar Nun’s ‘Questions’ and the Diyarbakır Commentary were among Ishoʿdad’s various sources (see Van Rompay 2000, 566–570 with much of the relevant literature; see also <ref type="cr">Exegesis, OT</ref>). Compared to Bar Nun and Ishoʿdad, Bar Koni seems to have been a stricter follower of Theodore of Mopsuestia and to have left less room for spiritual exegesis, as can be seen for example in his opinion that the Song of Songs is <i>lā yutrā</i><i>n</i> ‘useless’ (Scher [CSCO 55], 324). It should be noted that in addition to questions of a strictly exegetical nature, Bar Koni often discusses various philosophical and theological concepts within the first 9 <i>memre</i>. It is for this reason that Griffith (1982) has proposed that the Scholion be seen not solely as an exegetical commentary, but rather as a <i>Summa</i>of theology of the Ch. of E.</p>
<p>The 10th <i>memrā</i>of the Scholion is an apology for Christianity against Islam (see Griffith 1981). The question and answer format of the previous <i>memre</i> is replaced in this <i>memrā</i>by a dialogue between a teacher, who speaks on behalf of Christians, and a student, who speaks on behalf of Muslims or <i>ḥanpe</i>‘pagans’ as stated in the text (an obvious word-play with Arabic <i>al-</i><i>ḥanīf</i>‘a true believer, muslim’). This <i>memrā</i>is an important representative of Muslim-Christian dialogue in the early Abbasid period (see <ref type="cr">Islam, Syriac contacts with</ref>).</p>
<p>The 11th <i>memrā</i>of the Scholion is a description of what Bar Koni calls ‘all the heresies before and after Christ’ (Scher [CSCO 69], 284). Those treated include Zoroastrianism, Mandaeism, Manichaeism, various types of Gnosticism, as well as the ‘heresies’ of the Quqites, Orphites, and the Bardaiṣanites, to name only a few. One of the sources of this <i>memrā</i>is the <i>Anakephalaiōsis</i>(<i>CPG</i> 3765), an abridgement of the <i>Panarion</i>(<i>CPG</i> 3745) of <ref type="cr">Epiphanius of Salamis</ref>. Despite the obvious limitations, this <i>memrā</i>remains an important source of information for many of these religions (see Pognon, Drijvers, Gerö, and especially Kruisheer).</p>

<p>Author and counter-patriarch. He was the son of priest Sahdo bar Wahbun in <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>. He became a monk and priest, received a theological and philosophical education, and mastered Syriac, Greek, Armenian, and Arabic. In the 1170s he worked as the secretary of Patr. <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> in the <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref> and was entrusted by the Patr. with the task of participating in negotiations aiming at ecclesiastical union that were held in Cilician Armenia between the Armenians and Theorianos, the representative of the Byzantine Emperor. Accused by Michael of plotting against him, he was expelled from the monastery. In 1180, however, four discontented bishops consecrated him as (counter-) patriarch in <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>, under the name of Yuḥanon. Nevertheless, he was arrested and relegated to lay status at a synod under Michael’s direction, and subsequently imprisoned in the Monastery of Barṣawmo. He was able to escape and made it to <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>, where he found support with the Latin patriarch. From Jerusalem he wrote a long letter to a metropolitan bp. of Tarsus, in which he justified his consecration as patr., as well as a conciliatory letter to Patr. Michael. After Sultan Saladin took Jerusalem in 1187 he eventually returned to Cilicia, where the Armenian King and the Armenian Catholicos acknowledged him as the Patr. of the Syr. Orth. He must have had followers among the Syr. Orth. as well. The schism within the Syr. Orth Church that had erupted at his consecration came to an end when Theodoros suddenly died in 1193. In addition to the two letters written from Jerusalem, an Anaphora, an explanation of the liturgy, and two poems from his hand have been preserved.</p>

<Author>H. Kaufhold</Author><LemmaTitle>Theodosios</head><ab type="infobox"/>Romanos the physician (d. 896) 
[Syr. Orth.]
<p>Patr. (887–96), author, and physician. A monk from the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref>, Romanos was elected in 887, after a vacancy of four years, following the death of Patr. Ignatius I (883). As patr. he took the name Theodosios. No details of his tenure are known, except that a few canons attributed to him are known in the later tradition. In his primary field of expertise, <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> mentions ‘a wonderful medical compendium’ (<i>kunošo tmiho b-osyuto</i>), which after the author’s election as patr. circulated as ‘the compendium of Patr. Theodosios’ ­(<i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, ed. Abbeloos and Lamy, vol.  1, 389–92); this is, however, not preserved. In another work Bar ʿEbroyo reports that Romanos was from <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref> (see Marsh, 176* and 186).</p>
<p>Theodosios’s preserved works include: 1. an explanation of 112 ‘symbolic sayings of wise men’ (<i>melle remzonoyoto d-ḥakime</i>), many of which are of Pythagorean origin, as the author himself points out (ed. and FT by Zotenberg; see also Marsh, 145, n. 2); 2. a commentary on the Book of the Holy Hierotheos (extracts in Marsh and Pinggéra); 3. (in Arabic) a synodical letter to the Coptic Patr. Michael III; 4. (also in Arabic) a homily for Lent.</p>
<p>Theodosios’s lengthy commentary on the Book of the Holy Hierotheos consists of five books. It is preceded by a letter to Eliʿozor (also called Loʿozar), bp. of Cyrrhus, who had requested the commentary, as well as by a general introduction, while each book has a separate introduction as well. Theodosios seems to accept Hierotheos’s authorship and, as far as can be judged from the published extracts, does not mention the name of <ref type="cr">Stephen bar Ṣudayli</ref>. Bar ʿEbroyo, who also wrote a commentary on the same book, knew Theodosios’s commentary and used it in his work.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Theodosios of Edessa</head><ab type="infobox"/> (late 8th – early 9th cent.) [Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Metropolitan bp. of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, author, and translator. He was the older brother of Patr. <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> and, like his brother, had been a monk at <ref type="cr">Qenneshre</ref>. His consecration as bp. took place under Patr. <ref type="cr">Quryaqos</ref> (d. 817) and was followed by some agitation among the Edessenians, which Quryaqos, however, was able to lay to rest (<ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, XII.7; Syr. 493; FT 3.28). Theodosios accompanied his brother on a trip to Egypt in 824/5. According to Barsoum, he died in 832.</p>
<p>Theodosios is the author of a historical work. This is not preserved, but it was referred to and used by his brother Dionysios, and through him it was known to Michael Rabo. In addition, <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (Ecclesiastical History, ed. Abbeloos and Lamy, vol. 1, 361–64) attributes to him a Syriac translation of the poems (<i>mušḥoto</i>) of <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>. One poem, transmitted in ms. Vat. Syr. 96 (no. 20; S. E. and J. S. Assemani, <i>Bibliothecae Apostolicae Vaticanae … Catalogus</i>, I.2 [1758], 521) specifically attributes the translation to Theodosios, while he was priest in Edessa, and dates the translation to the year 802 (A. Gr. 1113, June to A. Gr. 1114, Dec.). This translation seems to be identical to the one preserved in ms. Vat. Syr. 105 (which was misdated by the Assemanis and belongs to the 9th cent.). Since these poems have been translated on three different occasions (see Gregory of Nazianzus), it is not always possible to distinguish between the work of each translator.</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Theodosius of Alexandria</LemmaTitle> <ab type="infobox"/>(d. 566)
<p>Patr. of Alexandria; leader of the Egyptian and Syrian anti-Chalcedonians. After the death of the Alexandrian patr. Timothy IV (Feb. 535), Gaianus first gained access to the patriarchal throne (who stood in the tradition of <ref type="cr">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref>), but he was removed by the emperor Justinian after only three months and replaced with Theodosius, who stood in the Severian-Miaphysite tradition. The imperial policy had been much more lenient in Egypt than in Syria (where Miaphysite bps. were no longer to be found since the middle of the 520s). But even in Egypt, Chalcedonian pressure increased and led to the deposal of Theodosius, in 536 or 537 (there is no agreement in the sources) and his replacement with a committed Chalcedonian in the person of Paul of Tabennisi. Theodosius found refuge in the large community of Miaphysite exiles in Constantinople, protected and apparently somewhat supported by the empress <ref type="cr">Theodora</ref>. Following the death of <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> (d. 538, after having lived as an exile in Egypt for twenty years), the Syr. Miaphysites turned to Theodosius for leadership. Only in the mid 550s did they consider electing their own patr., first Sergius and a few years later <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Beth Ukome</ref>.</p>
<p>In his place of exile, Theodosius carried out, with imperial permission, the consecration of bp. <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref>, and together with Yaʿqub he was instrumental in setting up a new Syr. Miaphysite episcopal hierarchy in the 550s.</p>
<p>Of Theodosius’s literary <i>oeuvre</i>, which must have been written originally in Greek, only small fragments exist in Greek, while a number of texts exist in Coptic and Arabic. It is, however, Syriac literature that has preserved by far the largest number and the most significant of his writings.</p>
<p>The ‘Documenta ad origines Monophysitarum illustrandas’ (a collection of official and semi-official documents of the Syr. Orth. Church in the 6th cent., preserved in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,602 of the late 6th or early 7th cent.) contain several of Theodosius’s letters dealing with church administration and show him at the center of the network of Miaphysite bps. and church leaders (ed. Chabot; useful overview in Van Roey and Allen, 265–303). Two letters by Theodosius (one to Severus of Antioch, and the other to Anthimus of Constantinople) are preserved in <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref> (ed. E. W.  Brooks, in CSCO 84, 158–63 and 168–73; FT in CSCO 88, 107–11 and 114–7) and in <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> (ed. Chabot, Syr. 290–94 and 294–5; FT in vol. 2, 211–7 and 217–9).</p>
<p>As a theologian Theodosius was forced to take a stance against the Agnoetai (a group of theologians, followers of an Alexandrian deacon, Themistius, attributing a certain form of ‘not-knowing’ to the human soul of Christ). Theodosius’s major works in this regard are the ‘Tome to Theodora’ (Van Roey and Allen, 16–56 [Syr. and LT]) and the ‘Letter to the Armenians’ (ibid., 57–59). Another theological discussion in which he became involved concerned ‘Tritheism’ (which focused on the distinctness of the three persons of the Trinity and was represented, among others, by <ref type="cr">John Philoponos</ref>). This issue was dealt with in the ‘Theological discourse’ and some related documents (Van Roey and Allen, 103–263).</p>
<p>Theodosius’s high standing in the eyes of the Syrian Miaphysites is reflected in <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>’s chapter on the ‘Lives of five patriarchs’ (ed. E. W. Brooks, in PO 18.4, 684–90).</p>

<Author>L. Van Rompay</Author><LemmaTitle>Theodotos of Amid</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. 698) [Syr. Orth.]
<p>Holy man and bp. His Syr. name is written with final <i>ālaph</i>, which has led modern scholars to read ‘Theodota’ or ‘Theodote’. Theodotos was from the village of ʿĀnāt on the mountain of Beth Igalaye in the region of <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>. From a young age, he was inclined towards the study of the Scriptures and asceticism and eventually went to the Monastery of Zuqnin to take up the monastic habit. At Zuqnin, he met a monk (later to become a bp.) named Severos, who agreed to be his spiritual father. Theodotos moved to Severos’s <ref type="cr">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref> and remained there until the death of Patr. Theodoros in 666/7. From Qenneshre, Theodotos made a pilgrimage to Mt. Sinai and <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> and next sailed to Egypt, spending five years there and only leaving to escape being made bp. Back in the region of Amid, he continued to work miracles and his ascetic feats made him famous. Fleeing another attempt to elevate him to the episcopacy, Theodotos spent his next five years in the region of Claudia. He was eventually consecrated bp. of Amid by Patr. Yulyanos II (687–707/8). In his old age, Theodotos left Amid and founded his own monastery near the monastery of Mar Abay at Qeleth. There he would die on 15 Aug. 698.</p>
<p>The Syriac Life of Theodotos was written down in Samosata by a priest named Shemʿun based on information learned from Theodotos’s disciple, Yawsep. Likely composed in the early 8th cent., Arabs appear a number of times in the text and it provides a window into this earliest period of Christian-Muslim interactions in the Middle East (see <ref type="cr">Islam, Syriac contacts with</ref>).</p>
<p>The Life of Theodotos is preserved in two mss.: Damascus 12/18 (late 12th cent.) and Mardin 275/8, a copy of the Damascus ms. made by Dolabani. The Life was translated into Arabic (<ref type="cr">Garshuni</ref>) in 1733/4 and exists in ms. St. Mark’s Jerusalem 199. At some point after this translation was made, the Syriac text was damaged and consequently, the Garshuni must be used to reconstruct lost passages. A Syriac and Garshuni edition is in preparation by A. Palmer and J. Tannous.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Theophilos of Edessa</head><ab type="infobox"/>(d. 785) [Maron.]
<p>Multifaceted author, historiographer, and translator. Theophilos, who is said to have been a Maronite, served as astrologer to the Abbasid Caliph al-Mahdī (r. 775–785) and wrote in Arabic several works on astrology, among which an influential book on military forecasts, which by the mid-9th cent. had been partly translated into Greek.</p>
<p>Theophilos’s translations from Greek into Syriac include works by <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>, possibly <ref type="cr">Galen</ref>, and most importantly Homer. Even though <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> attributes to Theophilos the translation of ‘two books’ by Homer, which seems to suggest that both the Iliad and the Odyssey were involved, there is no evidence that the Odyssey ever existed in Syriac. The Iliad, by contrast, was known to several authors, such as <ref type="cr">Anṭun of Tagrit</ref> and the author of the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of 1234</ref> (who incorporated a long extract into his work), and it is plausible that Theophilos’s translation was their source. That the Greek text of the Iliad was available to Syr. scholars is proven by the underwriting of ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 17,210 (60 folios containing the Greek Iliad in a 5th-cent. hand), which was re-used in the early 9th cent. for copying works by <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> (see Wright, <i>Catalogue … British Museum</i>, vol. 2, 548a–550b).</p>
<p>In addition, Theophilos is the author of a historical work, which was used by <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> and through Dionysios was known to <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> and to the author of the Chronicle of 1234. Dionysios calls Theophilos a Chalcedonian and accuses him of being biased against the Syr. Orth., which did not prevent him, however, from using Theophilos to a considerable extent. Even though Theophilos’s historical work does not survive, it is not only Dionysios who transmits some of his materials. Scholars nowadays assume that Theophilos’s work served as the common source on which, in addition to Dionysios, two other historians drew: the Byzantine historian Theophanes (who must have known an abridged Greek translation) and the Melkite Agapius of Manbij, who wrote in Arabic. In all likelihood, Theophilos’s work was a narrative history that focused on the early Islamic period, until the middle of the 8th cent. (see Hoyland, 631–71).</p>
<p>While some scholars in the past wanted to see the remnants of Theophilos’s work in the imperfectly preserved Maronite Chronicle (which covers the period from Alexander to the 660s: ed. E. W. Brooks and J. B.  Chabot, in CSCO 3–4 [1904], 43–74 [Syr.], 37–57 [LT]), this has now become very unlikely, in view of the lack of overlap between the Maronite Chronicle and the ‘common source’ referred to above.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Composed in Syriac probably in the 3rd cent. (provenance unknown, though traditionally placed at <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>), the Acts of Thomas is one of the most important of the various apocryphal texts associated with Thomas. The Acts of Thomas survive in Syriac and in an early Greek translation; the latter shows less signs of revision and appears to preserve a more primitive form of the text. The popular Acts of Thomas was translated into several Eastern Christian languages and even found its way into the Latin tradition. In a novella of 13 Acts, it presents ­Judas Thomas as a ‘twin brother’ of Jesus and recounts his missionary efforts to India — though the text appears confused as to whether he went to N.W. India (perhaps Persia) or S. India. The Acts of Thomas culminates in an account of Thomas’s martyrdom at the order of king Mazdai in S. India due to the social disruption caused by his ascetic teaching. The composite nature of the work is evident. It includes liturgical texts illuminating primitive Syriac baptismal and eucharistic practices, and incorporates earlier poems: ‘Hymn of the Bride’ and the much studied ‘Hymn of the Pearl’. Apart from supplying the earliest known connection between Thomas and Indian Christians, the sermons and narratives provide information about early Christian evangelistic attitudes and practices in western Asia and illuminate the ascetic values that are typical of the Apocryphal Acts generally and of early Syriac spirituality in particular. Various attempts have been made to characterize the Acts of Thomas as Gnostic, Manichean, or anti-Manichean. Different recensions and versions do exhibit particular theological tendencies, and some form of the Acts of Thomas was adapted and used by Manicheans. However, the judgment that the original Acts of Thomas was basically Gnostic may owe more to the unfamiliarity on the part of many western scholars with the distinctive character of early Syriac Christianity.</p>

<Author>J. W. Childers</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Thomas Christians
</LemmaTitle><p>Thomas Christians is the term often used for Christians in south-west India (Malabar) belonging to Churches of Syr. tradition, since they trace their origins back to St. Thomas who, according to tradition, arrived in South India in 52. The early name given to them locally was ‘Nazrani’, which corresponds to <i>nā</i><i>ṣrāye</i>, which was used by the Sasanian authorities for Christians (subsequently taken over in Arabic). Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the 16th cent. the Thomas Christians were all part of the Ch. of E. Since the late 16th cent., however, successive divisions have taken place, with the result that today in Kerala there are seven different Churches of Syriac tradition: those of the original E.-Syr. liturgical tradition are: the <ref type="cr">Malabar Catholic Church</ref> and the <ref type="cr">Chaldean Syrian Church</ref> (the latter belonging to the Ch. of E., and not the Chaldean Catholic Church); and of W.-Syr. liturgical tradition: the <ref type="cr">Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church</ref>, under the Patriarchate of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>; the independent <ref type="cr">Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church</ref>; the <ref type="cr">Malankara Catholic Church</ref>; the small <ref type="cr">Malabar Independent Syrian Church</ref>, and the reformed <ref type="cr">Mar Thoma Syrian Church</ref>.</p>
<p>Written and archaeological sources for the pre-Portuguese period are minimal, local written ones having been destroyed at the <ref type="cr">Synod of Diamper</ref> (Udayamperur, 1599). Sea trade between the Red Sea and the south Indian port of Muziris (usually identified as Kodungalur/ Cranganore) was well developed by the 1st cent. AD, and there is nothing impossible in the strong local oral and written traditions that St. Thomas came to south India (although the Syriac <ref type="cr">Acts of Thomas</ref>, of perhaps the 3rd cent., seem to bring him to the north). Several 3rd-cent. Greek sources, however, link him with Parthia. <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> refers to Thomas being killed in India, and states that a merchant had brought some of his bones to <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (<i>madrāše</i>of Nisibis 42.1–2). Mylapore as the site of Thomas’s martyrdom is not attested until the Middle Ages, in accounts by Western travellers (<ref type="cr">Shlemon of Baṣra</ref>, ‘Book of the Bee’, ed. Budge, 119 [tr. 105], knew a tradition that ‘he was buried at Maḥluph in the region of the Indians’). Much confusion has been caused, especially in Greek and Latin sources, by the ambiguity of the term ‘India’, which often clearly refers to Ethiopia or South Arabia.</p>
<p>It is unclear when the link with the Ch. of E., in the Persian Empire, was established. According to the Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref> ( [PO 26], I.8), Dodi, bp. of Baṣra (evidently 3rd/4th cent.) left his see to go to India where he converted many people; later (PO [117], II.9;) Maʿne, metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Fars</ref> (late 5th cent.), is said to have composed <i>madrāše</i>, <i>memre</i>, and <cTypeface:Italic>ʿ<i>enyāne</i> in (Middle) Persian for liturgical use and sent these books ‘to the islands of the sea and to India’. In the early 6th cent. Cosmas Indicopleustes, a friend of the Catholicos Mar <ref type="cr">Aba</ref>, speaks of a church at Male (Malabar) and a bp. ‘appointed from Persia’ at Kalliana (identified either as Kalyan, Mumbai-Pune area, or as Quilon; ‘Topography’, III.15), and in the mid-7th cent. one of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿyahb III</ref>’s Letters (ed. Duval, p.252) implies that India’s line of bishops was dependent on the metropolitan see of Rev Ardashir (in Fars, on the Persian Gulf). The link with Fars helps explain why Pahlavi, rather than Syriac, features on the various 9th-cent.(?) stone crosses (an improved reading for one of these is given by Ph. Gignoux, <i>Studies in Honor of J. C.  Greenfield</i>, ed. Z. Zevit et al. [1995], 411–22). One of Patr. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>’s lost letters was to the Indian Christians concerning the election of a bp., and elsewhere he speaks of monks regularly travelling to and from India.</p>
<p>Although India was supplied with bishops (and from Timotheos’s time, metropolitans) from the Middle East, the effective control lay in the hands of the indigenous Archdeacon.</p>
<p>References to two early migrations from the Middle East to Kerala are first recorded by 16th-cent. western writers, based on local oral accounts. The first migration is linked to Knai Thoman, represented in western sources as Thomas of Cana, the Canaanite (thus also in one Syriac text, Mingana 1926, 481, 513), who is said to have come with a group of Christians including a bp. Yawsep (sometimes, of Edessa) in 345. Numerous inconclusive attempts to explain the name Knai have been made. The tradition is especially important for the endogamous Knanaya (or ‘Southists’) who trace back their origins to this Thomas. A later group said to have come from the Middle East was led by two bishops, Mar Shabur and Mar Prot (Phrahat, or Peroz?), together with ‘the resplendent’ Sabrishoʿ; an exact date, 823, is even given in one Syriac source (ed. Land, <i>Anecdota Syriaca</i>, vol. 1, 27, tr. 125). This Sabrishoʿ is often identified with ‘Marovan Sapir Iso’, the builder of the Tharisa church in Quilon which was granted certain privileges in a set of copper plates in Old Tamil, dated 849.</p>
<p>The only pre-Portuguese Syriac document from India is a Lectionary of the Pauline Epistles, copied in Shengala (Cranganore) in June 1301, in the time of ‘the Turkish Catholicos Patriarch <ref type="cr">Yahbalaha</ref> V [!, in fact  III] and Metropolitan Mar Jacob, governor of the holy throne of Mar Thomas the Apostle’ (ms. Vat. Syr. 22); the scribe identifies himself as deacon Zkarya, aged 14.</p>
<p>A very important Syriac source from shortly after the arrival of the first Portuguese is a letter of 1504, with a historical introduction (ed. Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, III.ii, 589–99; tr. in Mingana 1926, 468–73). This tells how in 1490 two Indians travelled to Gazarta (modern Cizre) to ask the Cath. for bishops; two bishops were consecrated and sent to India, and then in 1501 the next Catholicos sent three further ones, who in 1504 dispatched back the letter in question, describing the situation of the Thomas Christians (‘some 30,000 households’). One of the two Indians in 1490 was ‘Joseph the Indian’ who later provided the account of Malabar that formed Book VI of Fracanzano da Montalboddo’s immensely popular <i>Paesi novamente retrovati</i> (1507). And one of the bishops consecrated in 1501 was Mar Yaʿqub who was to play a prominent and difficult role in dealing with the Portuguese; he died some time before 1554. A slightly later Syr. bp. was Mar Yawsep, consecrated for Malabar by the Chald. Patr. in 1558 (five years after the separate Chald. Catholic line had come into being). Western missionaries in Bassein, however, were successful in preventing him from reaching his destined flock. While in Bassein, and even during his long sea voyages, he diligently copied Syriac mss., several of which survive (van der Ploeg 1983).</p>
<p>Although the Thomas Christians had at first welcomed the arrival of fellow Christians from Europe, by the end of the 16th cent. the situation had changed. The last Indian bp., Mar Abraham, died in 1597, and in 1599 the metropolitan see of Angamali was demoted to a bishopric under the archbishop of Goa. The next year the Malabar Church was put under the Portuguese Royal Patronage (Padroado). The destruction of all Syriac books considered heretical at the Synod of Diamper (1599) and the Romanization of the rite (though Syriac was still allowed) witness to the domineering character of the European hierarchy in India. Any attempts to contact bishops — even Chald. Catholic ones — in the Middle East were foiled. In the end, (false) rumors of the drowning of a bp. from the Middle East, Mar Atallah, led to open revolt in 1653, with the ‘Oath of the Coonan Cross’ (Mattancherry), when the Archdeacon Thomas was ‘ordained’ as bp. by 12 priests, claiming to have a letter from Mar Atallah legitimizing this. This effectively split the Thomas Christians into two nearly equal halves, those who remained under the control of Rome, and those who were in due course to come under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Antioch.</p>
<p>Contact in due course was made by the adherents of Thomas with a Syr. Orth. bp., Mar Gregorios, in 1665, and links with the Syr. Orth. Church were further strengthened in 1685, when Maphrian Baselios Yaldo and Mar Ivanios were sent to India by Patr. ʿAbdulmasīḥ I; although Mar Baselios died shortly afterwards, he left a great impression (thus at Kothamangalam a long inscription in his honor was put up in 1874). In this way the W.-Syr. liturgical tradition (and script) was gradually introduced into Malabar, and seems to have been fully effected by the end of the first quarter of the 19th cent. (van der Ploeg 1983, 39). Prior to this, in 1772, a quarrel had led to schism and the establishment of the separate small Malabar Independent Syrian Church, based in Thozhiyur.</p>
<p>Further divisions came in the 19th cent., when a reform movement among the Syr. Orth., led by Abraham malpan and supported by Anglican missionaries, led to the emergence of the Mar Thoma Church, which formally came into being in 1888. The second half of the 19th cent. also witnessed the renewal, after a break of some 400 years, of the ancient link with Ch. of E., with the emergence of the Chaldean Syrian Church.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the 19th cent. requests began to be made by the Syr. Orth. to the Patr. of Antioch that a Cath. (corresponding in rank to that of the earlier <ref type="cr">Maphrian</ref>) be appointed for India. Patr. Peṭros IV (III) agreed to consider the matter, but nothing was done until the deposed Patr. ʿ<ref type="cr">Abdulmasīḥ II</ref> visited India in 1912 and consecrated Pawlos Mar Ivanios as Cath., an action which effected a schism with the party loyal to Patr. ʿ<ref type="cr">Abdullāh II</ref>. Though a re-unification of the two sides was achieved in 1964, the break was renewed in 1975. Drawn-out and expensive litigation over property remains a running scandal.</p>
<p>A different division within the W.-Syr. tradition took place in 1930, when Mar Ivanios, together with a sizable group of Syr. Orth., entered into communion with Rome, thus marking the beginnings of the Malankara Catholic Church. In the E.-Syr. tradition one further division took place in 1968, just within the Chaldean Syrian Church, when loyalties became divided between the two Patriarchs, Mar <ref type="cr">Shemʿ<ref type="cr">on</ref> (New Calendarists) and Mar <ref type="cr">Darmo</ref> (Old Calendarists), leading to the establishment, from 1971, of two rival metropolitans in Kerala. This schism, however, was successfully healed in 1995, when the entire Chaldean Syrian Church was united with Patr. Mar Denḥa IV (New Calendarists).</p>
<p>Syriac remained the language of the liturgy until well into the 20th cent. in most of the Churches of Syriac tradition; today, however, it has almost entirely been replaced by Malayalam, even among the Syr. Orth. where it has held out longest. A large number of Syriac mss. have been copied in Kerala (van der Ploeg). Less frequent has been the use of Syriac for <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref>, the earliest being dated 1575 (Mulanthuruthy); in more recent times it has principally been the Syr. Orth. who have retained Syriac for funerary and commemorative inscriptions; an impetus to this practice seems to have been given by Mar Kurillos Yuyaqim, from Ḥbob in <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, who came to Malabar in 1846, where he died in 1875. A Corpus of Syriac inscriptions in Kerala, by F. Briquel Chatonnet, A. Desreumaux, and J. Thekeparampil, has recently been published. During the second half of the 19th and well into the 20th cent. a number of Syriac <ref type="cr">printing</ref> presses were functioning; particularly important ones were the St. Joseph Press, Mannanam (for E. Syr.), and the Mar Julius Press, Pampakuda (for W. Syr.).</p>

<p>Cath. of the Ch. of E. Timotheos was born in the village of Ḥazza (near <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref> in Iraq). His education was supported by his uncle Gewargis, the bp. of Beth Bgash. In Bashosh and Marga he studied with the famed scholar <ref type="cr">Abraham bar Dashandad</ref>. Abraham was renowned as a scholar of the Bible and of <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>. He was also an effective teacher of techniques of translation from Greek into Syriac. Timotheos succeeded his uncle as bp. of Beth Begash.</p>
<p>In 779, the Cath. <ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ II</ref> was poisoned. At the convocation of bishops in 780, Timotheos was elevated to the patriarchate, a position he would hold through the rule of five caliphs. Timotheos worked to improve the status of Christians in the Caliphate and beyond through a variety of initiatives.</p>
<p>First, he worked to improve the moral and educational level of both clergy and laity. He encouraged scholarship, including the development of linguistic skills. He both translated (Aristotle’s Topics) and encouraged the translation work of others, assuring that a large number of texts were translated from Greek into Syriac and Arabic. More than two hundred letters were known, about 59 of which survive. Timotheos was also the author of ‘The Ordinances of Ecclesiastical Judgments and of Inheritance’. This still unpublished tome sought to bring reasoned order to the churches. Timo­theos’s contributions to biblical studies, hermeneutics, and bible translation were significant. He even obtained a copy of Origen’s Hexapla in order to have access, for himself and his translators, to the best possible biblical text. Timotheos also wrote, according to ʿ<ref type="cr">Abdishoʿ <ref type="cr">bar Brikha</ref>, a commentary on a text of <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>.</p>
<p>Timotheos also established the juridical structures of the E.-Syr. Church including the development of the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>, a collection of the decisions of the councils of the E.-Syr. Church. Most importantly, he improved understanding between Christians and Muslims. His dialogue with Caliph al-Mahdī (775–85) is preserved in both Syriac and Arabic. Beyond the formal discussions, his diplomatic skills facilitated the development of the E.-Syr. church in the Caliphate and throughout Asia.</p>
<p>The organization and spread of Christianity in Asia and the Middle-East consumed a lot of Timotheos’s energy. He organized and/or revitalized organization of the churches in areas as diverse as <ref type="cr">China</ref>, Tibet, Yemen, India, and Central Asia. He encouraged the production of theological literature in the indigenous languages and the development of indigenous non-Syrian leadership of churches. While Christians had been establishing communities along the trade routes of Asia for centuries, Timotheos provided structure and intellectual renewal for the ongoing traditions.</p>

<p>Miaphysite Patr. of Alexandria 457–60, 475–7. His nick-name ‘Ailouros’, or ‘weasel’, was due to his lean build. He attended the second Council of Ephesus in 449, together with Patr. Dioscorus. After the lynching of the pro-Chalcedonian Patr. Proterius in 457 he was made Patr. but was expelled by the emperor in 460, eventually to be restored under Basiliscus. His writings (<i>CPG</i> 5475–5489), originally in Greek, survive for the most part only in Syriac and Armenian. His major work, ‘On the Unity of Christ’, against the Council of Chalcedon (<i>CPG</i> 5475) is complete in Armenian (ed. K. Ter Mekerttschian and E. Ter-Minassiantz, 1908; text only) but only in an abridged form in Syriac (not yet fully published). Several of his letters and a refutation of another work against the Chalcedonian Definition of Faith and the Tome of Leo survive only in Syriac.</p>

<p>Metropolitan of India. Abimalek was born in Marbishu in Turkey and graduated from the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Assyrian Mission school for priests in 1901. He was made an archdeacon in 1904. In 1907, in reply to a petition sent three years earlier from the community at Trichur, Mar Benyamin Shemʿon consecrated him for the see of Malabar. In India he was an autocratic leader and his career was marked by litigation. As the senior bp. in the church he visited Iraq in 1919, 1920–1, and 1927–
1928. On the second visit he protested against the consecration of Mar<ref type="cr"> Eshai Shemʿon</ref> and was made regent to the boy Patr. But his claim to keep this title in 1927 was rejected by the family, and he was deported back to India. His special achievement was the foundation of the Mar Narsai Press in Trichur, which became the main church <ref type="cr">printing</ref> office in English, Syriac, and Malayalam.</p>

<Author>A. H. Becker</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Toma of Marga</head><ab type="infobox"/> (9th cent.) [Ch. of E.]
<p>E.-Syr. abbot and bp., the author of a monastic history. Toma son of Yaʿqob, was born in the 810s in the village of Neḥshon (Book of Governors, II, 311) in the district of Beth Sharonaye, in the diocese of Slokh, <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref>.</p>
<p>In 832, as a ‘young man’ he became a monk in the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Beth ʿAbe</ref> (‘The Forest Monastery’), in Marga, ca 100 km. north-east of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>. It was one of the most renowned E.-Syr. monasteries, from which many bps., metropolitans, and catholicoi of the E.-Syr. Church hailed. When in the year 837 a former monk and abbot of Beth ʿAbe, Abraham, became Cath. (Abra­ham  II, 837–50), Toma, his friend in the monastery, became his secretary. A few years later (in 840s) Abraham appointed Toma bp. of Marga. We know nothing more about his life, and even the date of his death remains unknown.</p>
<p>For a long time it was thought that Toma was also appointed by Cath. Abraham II metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>, and that he was a brother of Cath. Theodosios (853–58). However, in the light of Fiey’s research (1965, 362–4), it appears that Toma of Marga and Toma 
the metropolitan of Beth Garmai are two different 
persons.</p>
<p>Toma wrote three books, all within the genre of monastic history.</p>
<p>The first of them, which may have been entitled ‘The Histories of certain holy men’, is only known from his own mention of it in the ‘Book of Governors’. It is probable that the material of the former book was re-used by Toma in the latter.</p>
<p>Toma’s second work was ‘The History of the Monastery of Rabban Cyprian’ (in Birtha, in the diocese of Marga), which contained an account of the first monks (before <ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref>) in this region. This, although written earlier, was incorporated as the 6th book of Toma’s third and most comprehensive work:</p>
<p>The Book of the Governors (Syr. <i>ktābā d-reš</i><i>āne</i>), scil. of the Monastery of Beth ʿAbe (better: Book of Abbots), is also known in Western scholarship as <i>Historia Monastica</i>. This short title is known only from the colophon, whereas the full Syriac title is: ‘Useful stories and accounts of holy men and monks who for generations lived in the holy monastery of Beth ʿAbe, written by the venerable Mar Toma bishop of Marga’. The work was most probably written ca. 850 when Toma already was the bp. of Marga. He dedicated it to ʿAbdishoʿ, another monk in the same monastery, who encouraged him to write. It was modelled on the pattern of the Paradise of <ref type="cr">Palladius</ref>, known to Toma in the redaction of ­<ref type="cr">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref> (ca. 670) (Budge, <i>The Book</i>, vol. 1, xxxi–xxxiii). It provides not only a series of lives of the abbots, but also information on the catholicoi, metropolitans, and bps., as well as on the establishment of schools, theological controversies, etc. There is much material both on monks from other monastic houses (those on Mount Izla) and on the development of E.-Syr. monasticism in general from the 6th until the 9th cent. Toma also provides important accounts of the non-monastic history of the Ch. of E., such as the conversion of the peoples living southeast of the Caspian Sea and the missions to South Arabia, Persia, and <ref type="cr">China</ref>. He writes on the relations of the Christians with the Persian and later Muslim authorities, but also on matters such as the murder of the Sasanian king Khusrau and the expansion of the Muslim empire.</p>
<p>Toma has also shown his poetical skills by inserting into Book 3 a <i>memrā</i> in the 12–syllable meter on Maranʿammeh, metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>, i.e. of Adiabene, who had also been a monk of Beth ʿAbe.</p>

He subsequently became interested in the Modern Eastern-Aramaic dialects spoken by the many Assyrians living in Georgia. His original work on these dialects resulted in a great number of publications written in Georgian and/or Russian. Some of them were subsequently translated into western languages. He also published a description of Classical Syriac (1979, in Russian) and a short historical grammar of Aramaic, covering nearly three millennia of the history of the Aramaic languages (1982, in Georgian and Russian).

He was expelled from his see by the Chalcedonians and fled to Alexandria (Egypt) where he translated the NT. His Greek education qualified him not only for the translation work but also to serve his Church on the ‘ecumenical’ scene. He doubtless could speak Greek fluently and was engaged in the negotiations with the Egyptian (Coptic) Miaphysites and with the Chalcedonians.</p>
<p>His life is linked with Dometianus (ca. 550–602), the nephew of the Byzantine emperor Maurice (582–602), who was appointed Chalcedonian Bp. of <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref> (Malatya) by his uncle in ca. 580. In 598/99 this Dometianus started a persecution of the Miaphysites in the Orient, which made Tumo and other bps. (among whom was possibly <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Tella</ref>) flee to the <ref type="cr">Enaton</ref>, a monastic district nine miles outside of Alexandria (Michael, Chronicle, X,23 = vol. 4, 386). We do not know if he returned after the death of Dometianus when the Persians invaded the Byz. East and favoured the Miaphysites (but also the Ch. of E.) by expelling the Chalcedonian bishops (Bar ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, I,50 = vol. 1, col. 265; Michael, Chronicle, X,25 = vol. 4, 391).</p>
<p>In 615–6 he was at the Enaton, now linked with his Patr. <ref type="cr">Athanasios I Gamolo</ref> of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref> (594–631). Tumo was his ‘Synkellos’ and diplomat who shared his efforts to reunite with the Egyptian (Coptic) Miaphysites after decades of schism dating from the time of his predecessor <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref> (581–91). The exile of the Syriac bishops in Egypt during the persecution might have invited the Miaphysites to reunite, but the actual negotiations were initiated by the Byzantine notable Nicetas and favoured by the Emperor Heraclius (610–
641) for political reasons. After the reunion of the Coptic and Syrian Miaphysites succeeded in 616 (Bar ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, I,50 = vol. 1, col. 269; Michael, Chronicle, X,26 = vol. 4, 392–9; ‘History of the Patr.’, ed. B. Evetts, 480–3), Athanasios gave an extensive report to Bp. Quryaqos of <ref type="cr">Amid</ref> (Diyarbakır). This letter (Michael, Chronicle, X,26 = vol. 4, 392–9) reveals that both Patr. were not present in person and that Tumo was appointed speaker of the Syrians and charged with the negotiations.</p>
<p>When the Persians conquered Egypt and devastated the Enaton (619/20), Tumo and his version escaped destruction. After 627 the Persian power faded, and the victorious Emperor Heraclius was in a strong position when in 631 he met with Athanasios and twelve of his bishops (Tumo among them, according to Michael) at Mabbug to discuss a christological formula for union (Bar ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, I,50 = vol. 1, col. 271–73; Michael, Chronicle, XI,3 = vol. 4, 409–10). But no agreement was reached, and severe restrictions for the Miaphysites followed. In those days Tumo was about sixty years old, he died ca. 640. An anonymous Syriac account of Tumo’s life (Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 2, 90–2) confuses him with Tumo of Germanicea of the 6th cent.</p>

<Author>A. Juckel</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Ṭur ʿAbdin</LemmaTitle> 
<p>Properly speaking, Ṭur ʿAbdin (‘Mountain of the servants’) does not include the whole province of <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> in Turkey, but only the limestone plateau in the eastern part of it, between the river Tigris and <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>. The first bp. of Ṭur ʿAbdin resided at Ḥaḥ, a town in the north-east of Ṭur ʿAbdin, far from the center of the diocese. Ḥaḥ used to be much bigger than it is today, as the surrounding ruins and the ancient, relatively large basilica testify. Perhaps, its prosperity derived from trade across the Tigris in the period when Rome had provinces east of that river. If so, its decline may have begun with the loss of those provinces in 363. The <ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref> later took over from Ḥaḥ as the center of the diocese. In 613 Daniel ʿUzoyo became bp. of the united dioceses of Dara and Ṭur ʿAbdin, to which, for a while, were added those of Tella and <ref type="cr">Reshʿayna</ref>. This must have been a direct consequence of the Persian reconquest of Syria and Egypt. Thirty-five years after burning the Monastery of Qarṭmin in 570, the Persians took the Castle of ṬurʿAbdin (Qalʿat al-Haytam) in 605. The first idea of the conquerors seems to have been to bring in bishops from the Persian Ch. of E., but the bp. they placed in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> was rejected as a ‘Nestorian’ heretic; so they gave power instead to the Syr. Orth., a sect persecuted by the Roman Emperors in the 6th cent., who could therefore be relied on not to help Byzantium. As far as the Christian population was concerned, the situation remained unchanged under the Arabs and subsequent Muslim rulers.</p>
<p>Daniel (615–24) was given four dioceses, which probably means that the Syr. Orth. were much depleted by persecution at the time, especially in the cities, where imperial policing had been easier. He was abbot of Qarṭmin and that monastery now became the center of the diocese of Ṭur ʿAbdin. Monasteries had been the centers of resistance to the Council of Chalcedon (451).</p>
<p>In 1088/9 the diocese of Ṭur ʿAbdin was divided. After 450 years in abeyance, Ḥaḥ again became the episcopal see; but the bishops of Ṭur ʿAbdin now resided at <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Ṣalīb</ref>. A memorial inscribed shortly after this date at Qarṭmin has been read as an attempt to prevent the new bp. in the north-east of Ṭur ʿAbdin from claiming all the bishops of the region as his predecessors. If that is right, then the Monastery of Qarṭmin must have felt the division as a heavy blow to its prestige.</p>
<p>On 6 Aug. 1364, with the support of the other bishops of Ṭur ʿAbdin, the bp. of Ṣalaḥ, who resided in the Monastery of Mor Yaʿqub, outside that village, received a diploma from the Ayyubid ruler of Ḥesno d-Kifo, recognizing him as Patr. of Ṭur ʿAbdin. He had been excommunicated by Ishma<ref type="cr">ʿ</ref>il, the Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, who resided near Mardin. During the 475 years which followed, there were five reconciliations between the two patriarchates, ending with that of 1839. In this time the custom arose of appointing a <ref type="cr">Maphrian</ref> (or Catholicos) for the eastern part of Ṭur ʿAbdin. The most famous of these Maphrians was <ref type="cr">Shemʿun II</ref> of Beth Manʿem, a prolific writer in Syriac and Kurdish, whose works are still copied in Ṭur ʿAbdin.</p>
<p>With the exception of <ref type="cr">Masʿūd</ref>, a 15th-cent. mystical writer who lived in Ṭur ʿAbdin, the later history of the region is one long list of raids, wars, droughts, famines, plagues, and persecutions. For example, in 1200 the bp. of Qarṭmin was suffocated in the cave of Bar Siqay by the Mongol Hunnish raiders, together with thirty-two monks and 330 ordinary people; in 1405 and 1413 there were devastating epidemics in Ṭur ʿAbdin; and in the 1490s all the monasteries of Ṭur ʿAbdin were laid waste by a confederation of Kurdish tribes. This is a small part of all that the people of Ṭur ʿAbdin have suffered and survived. From the 13th cent. until the 20th they had Yezidis from Iraq as their neighbours and companions in persecution. In 1895, when the Ottoman Sultan ordered an attack on the Armenians, Ṭur ʿAbdin was spared. The region was not so fortunate in 1915, when it suffered a similar blow, from which the Christian villages never recovered. This year is remembered as <ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref> (‘the Sword’). They suffered again for their involvement in the Kurdish uprising of 1926, particularly in the diocese of Beth Rishe, where the Monastery of Mor Malke was destroyed. It was restored in 1955 and is still functioning, as are the monasteries of Ṣalaḥ (Mor Yaʿqub) and Qarṭmin (Mor Gabriel).</p>
<p>Whether or not the Christian remnant in Ṭur ʿAbdin proves to be sustainable, the churches and monasteries, if they are not neglected by the authorities, will survive as evidence of the importance of the region in the late Roman period. Bp. Shemʿun of <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref> (died 734), who was from the village of Habsenas, made his native Ṭur ʿAbdin prosperous once more with investments in the busy city of Nisibis; some of the surviving churches (including the church of the Monastery of Mor Yaʿqub at Ṣalaḥ, as may be inferred from the original position of the building inscription discovered by S. R. Palmer) were renovated from the foundations in the early Islamic period, circumventing the ban on new church buildings.</p>

<p>German excavations (1904–7), conducted near Bulayıq, north of Turfan, brought to light numerous fragmentary mss. evidently from the library of an E.-Syr. monastery. These texts are in several different languages and are often bilingual. At present there is no published catalogue of them all, though a project based in the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, plans to produce one.</p>
<p>There are said to be 400–500 small fragments in Syriac (Gillman and Klimkeit 1999, 251), very few of which have yet been published. They probably range in date from 9th to 12th/13th cent. Besides some biblical fragments, there are many liturgical ones; these include some of the earliest witnesses to the <i>Ḥudr</i><i>ā</i> (ET, from Sachau’s edition of 1905, in P. Y. Saeki, <i>The Nestorian ­
Documents and Relics in China</i> [1951], 337–47). Hagiographical texts include the Acts of St. George, and the Life of Barshabba, first bp. of Merv. Otherwise unknown texts include a dialogue between a Jew and a Christian, and a historical narrative concerning <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>. Two non-literary texts have been published (by Maroth), both in Serṭo and dating from ca. 10th cent.: one contains recipes for medical concoctions (one is against loss of hair), while the other is a draft of a letter, evidently to a high Byzantine official, written in very florid language.</p>
<p>Bilingual texts are liturgical (mostly NT lectionary texts and Psalms). The majority are Syriac and <ref type="cr">Sogdian</ref> (in alternating sentences, or with opening Syriac words only), but there is also one Syriac and New Persian (Psalms), several Syriac and Uighur-Turkish, and (surprisingly) one Greek and Sogdian, suggesting the presence of Melkites, too.</p>
<p>The great majority of the Christian texts are in Sogdian, and all are evidently translations from Syriac. Among the biblical (almost all, NT lectionaries) and liturgical texts are the Nicene Creed (in a Psalms ms., anticipating later usage), the <i>Gloria in excelsis</i>, an early form of a commentary on Baptism and the Eucharist, known in both E.- and W.- Syr. tradition, and a verse text by <ref type="cr">Babai of Nisibis</ref> (‘On the final evil hour’, not extant in Syriac). Hagiography is well represented, with fragments of the following: Barshabba, Cyriacus and Julitta, Eugenius, Eustathius, Finding of the Cross, <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Dailam</ref>, Acts of Peter, Pethion, Sarapion, Sergius and Bacchus, four martyrdoms under Shapur II (Shahdost, Tarbo, 120 martyrs, and Barbaʿshmin), and the <ref type="cr">Sleepers of Ephesus</ref>. Also prominent are monastic texts, which include <ref type="cr">Evagrius</ref>’s <i>Antirrheticus</i>, <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref>’s Commentaries on <ref type="cr">Isaiah of Scetis</ref> and the Paradise of the Fathers, some Sayings of the Fathers, and some unidentified texts, including parts of a homily on the three periods of the solitary life.</p>
<p>In Middle Persian there is one fragment of a Psalter, and some forty or more in Uighur Turkish; these include a fragment on St. George (ed. W. Bang, in <i>LM</i>39 [1926]).</p>
<p>In contrast to the ms. finds from the Turfan area, Syriac is barely represented at all at Dunhuang, further east: only two fragments have so far come to light, one of a Pauline Lectionary (W. Klein and J. Tubach, in <i>ZDMG</i> 144 [1994], 1–3; cf. H. Kaufhold, in <i>ZDMG</i> 146 [1996], 49–60), and the other of a Psalter (D. Qing, in <i>OC</i> 87 [2001], 84–93). Two Syriac fragments of liturgical texts were also found at Kara Khoto, a center of the Tangut (N. Pigulevskaya, in <i>ROC</i> 30 [1938], 3–46).</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>Ṭuroyo is the collective name for the various Modern Syriac dialects used in <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>. Its place within the spectrum of Modern Aramaic is closer to the numerous North Eastern Neo-Aramaic dialects than to the small western ones. The earliest texts written in Ṭuroyo belong to the late 19th cent. and were often written specifically for the benefit of western scholars (Heinrichs). Collections of recorded oral material have been made by Prym and Socin (1881), and especially by H. Ritter (3 vols., 1967, 1969, 1971). The wider written use of Ṭuroyo belongs to the second half of the 20th cent., starting in Qamishli. More recently in the <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref> it sometimes features in cultural magazines, either in Syriac script, or in a transcription devised by Dr. Yusuf Ishaq in Sweden. In recent years a number of writers have started to use Ṭuroyo as a literary language, especially for short stories (notably Jan Sawoce) and children’s books. There is an edition of the Four Gospels in Ṭuroyo (1995). There are grammars by A. Siegel (1923), O. Jastrow (3rd ed. 1985 [reference grammar]; 1992 [<i>Lehrbuch</i>]), and H. Ritter (1967–1990), and a number of dictionaries: H. Ritter (1979, Ṭuroyo-German); Kyrillus Jacob and Asmar Elkhoury (1985, Suryoyo-Swodoyo), Y. Ishaq (1988, Swedish-Ṭuroyo).</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Urmia</LemmaTitle> 
<p>Urmia (Urūmiyya, Rīzāya), a city in northwest Iran, west of Lake Urmia, is first mentioned in E.-Syr. sources in 1111, whereas the mentioning of bishops in Azerbaijan (Hoshaʿ of Ganzak in 486, Ḥenanishoʿ in 605), testify to earlier presence of the Ch. of E. in this region. In 1284, the Ch. of E. Patr., Mar <ref type="cr">Yahbalaha III</ref>, reportedly visited the Church of Mart Maryam in Urmia and dreamt about the imminent death of Khan Ahmad. From the 16th cent. onwards, bishops of Urmia are attested regularly in both western and eastern sources. In the 19th cent., the town became the center of western missionary activities in the region: Presbyterian missionaries of the American Board (1835), Roman Catholic Lazarist missionaries (1841), Lutherans (1881), Anglicans (1886), and Russian Orthodox (1897). Their activities contributed to the growth of Catholicism and the birth of an Assyrian Protestant (Evangelical) Church in the region, as well as to the strengthening of both the Ch. of E.’s and the new churches’ educational and clerical programs. In addition, the American mission press initiated the publication of both Classical Syriac and Neo-Aramaic texts, among which the first vernacular Bible translations in 1846 (NT) and 1852 (OT) and the first magazine, <i>Zahrire d-Bahrā</i> (‘Rays of Light’), in 1849. Towards the end of the 19th  cent., Urmia witnessed the birth of <ref type="cr">Assyrian</ref> nationalism. During the First World War, when the region’s Christians were under attack from Kurds and Turks, many found refuge in the missionary compounds. In 1918, however, the massive flight from Urmia towards the English in northern Iraq, cost many lives. After the war, Assyrian Christians returned to Urmia, and whereas most of the villages in the region were lost to the Christian population, the town itself remained an important center of Assyrian Christians of all denominations in Iran.</p>

<p>Professor of Syriac at the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium, from 1969 to 1974. Born in Lier in 1903, Ceslas (Florent) Van den Eynde entered the Dominican Order in 1922 and was ordained a priest in 1928. His doctoral dissertation, submitted at the Oriental Institute of the University of Louvain and published in 1939, dealt with the Syriac version of the commentary on the Song of Songs by <ref type="cr">Gregory of Nyssa</ref> (probably ca. 500), and its reception in later Syriac tradition.</p>
<p>In addition to his teaching and other obligations at the Dominican Seminary in Louvain, Van den Eynde worked on the edition and translation of the 9th-cent. OT commentaries of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, a project begun by his Dominican confrère Jacques-Marie Vosté (d.  1948). The critical edition of these commentaries, covering more than eleven hundred pages of Syriac text, appeared in six volumes between 1950 and 1981. The accompanying six volumes of translation, with substantial introductions and annotations, constitute the first systematic study of E.-Syr. OT interpretation. This seminal work has served as a model and a point of reference for all subsequent studies in the field. It was only at a later age that Van den Eynde was appointed professor of Syriac in the newly created Dutch-speaking Oriental Institute, following the division of the University of Louvain in 1968.</p>

<p>Van Roey was appointed professor at the University of Louvain in 1949 and taught patristics and Eastern Christianity. Following the division of the University in 1968, he played an important role in reorganizing both the Faculty of Theology and the Oriental Institute of the Dutch speaking university. In the latter institute (later department) he taught Arabic and, for some time, Syriac and Armenian. He was co-founder of the periodical <i>Orientalia Lovaniensia Periodica</i> (1970) and of the serial publications <i>Orientalia Lovaniensia Analecta</i> (1975) and <i>Corpus Christianorum, Series Graeca</i> (1977).</p>
<p>With a wide-ranging interest in history and theology, Van Roey focused on theological literature either originally written in Syriac or translated from Greek. Many of his projects, begun during his busy years as professor and university administrator, came to full fruition after his retirement in 1983. Among his publications, the edition and translation of 6th-cent. theological writings (with P.  Allen), of <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref> (with 
R. Y.  Ebied and L. R.  Wickham), of Eliya, and of Nonos are particularly noteworthy. He also did important work on the 16th-cent. Syriac scholar <ref type="cr">Andreas Masius</ref>. While fully committed to the Flemish cause in Belgium, Van Roey’s academic languages were Latin and French. It was only in later years and in the context of international collaboration that he began to use English. A Festschrift was offered to him in 1985 (ed. C.  Laga et al.).</p>

<p>Vaschalde’s Syriac career flourished at The Catholic University of America (CUA) where he received a Ph. D. in 1901. His dissertation, an edition, translation, and study of three letters of <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>, was published in 1902. Vaschalde taught Syriac and Coptic at CUA from 1910 to 1939. His work on the Coptic versions of the Bible remains an important resource for scholars today. In 1930 he became the editor for the Coptic section of the Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium (CSCO).

<p>Scholar, educator, pastor. Vööbus was born in Vera, Estonia and educated at the University of Tartu. Ordained in 1932, he served (1933–40) as pastor of St. Paul Lutheran Church in Tartu. His encounter with Syriac mss. at the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin (1935) filled him with ‘reverent awe’ and precipitated a lifelong search for ancient documents. When his homeland was overrun alternately by the Russian and German armies, he twice fled to Germany, barely escaping arrest by the Soviets (1940 and 1944), only to be interned (with his wife Ilse) by the Nazis (1941) for his opposition to fascism.</p>
<p>After earning his doctorate (1943), Vööbus taught first as assistant professor of Ancient Church History at the University of Tartu (1943–44), and then (1946–48) as associate professor at the Baltic University at Hamburg-Pinneberg in Germany, where he also provided pastoral care (1944–48) in the refugee camps. The Lutheran Seminary in Chicago (now the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago) offered him (1948) the chair of New Testament and Early Church History, a position which he held until his retirement in 1977. During his retirement he continued to teach part-time at LSTC, to travel in search of oriental mss., to publish, and to lecture as visiting professor of Syriac language and literature at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Vööbus led an enormously productive life. During his more than forty expeditions to the Near East his relentless search in dozens of monastery libraries and private collections in Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, and in other places, enabled him to access over 2,000 rare mss., most of which had been unknown in the west or were thought to have been lost. He captured more than 150,000 pages of the most significant mss. on microfilm. This precious ms. collection is still kept at LSTC, though it is now administered by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Vööbus’ own studies of these important documents resulted in the writing of more than 80 monographs and some 300 articles in international journals in English, French, German, and Estonian. Twenty-six of these monographs appeared in the series CSCO. Through these endeavours, Vööbus vastly expanded the store of available original sources and initiated new areas of investigation in the field of ancient Syriac Christianity and beyond.</p>
<p>Among the wide range of topics covered in Vööbus’ publications, the following main areas may be singled out: the Syriac text of the <ref type="cr">Bible</ref> (both OT and NT); Syriac asceticism; the <ref type="cr">Didascalia Apostolorum</ref>; <ref type="cr">juridical literature</ref> primarily of the W.-Syr. tradition; the transmission of the <i>memre</i> of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>; and the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>.</p>
<p>Always the devoted patriot, Vööbus also did much to preserve the memory of the history and culture of the Estonian people, publishing 14 volumes (1969–85) in the series Studies in the History of the Estonian People (SHEP), a sub-series within his 40-volume series Papers of the Estonian Theological Society in Exile (PETSE), which he had inaugurated in 1951 as a monument to the vigour of Lutheran scholarship in Estonia. Himself a victim of persecution, Vööbus held that a scholar has the duty to speak out as ‘a voice for the voiceless in suffering’. As such he wrote countless open letters, tractates, etc. warning against the dangers of communism. The extant bibliographies make only passing reference to this passionate advocacy on his part.</p>
<p>Professor Vööbus was elected to a number of learned societies, among them L’Académie Internationale Libre des Sciences et des Lettres (Paris), L’Académie Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique, The American Philosophical Society, and the Syriac Academy of Baghdad.</p>

<p>Syriac-speaking Christians painted their churches throughout their long history. In the Early Christian period, these paintings closely followed the style and iconography of painting in Constantinople. In the city of Resafa, Syria, built by Justinian in the 6th cent., remains of wall paintings are well preserved in the soffits of the windows of the Cathedral and a large cross was painted in the apse of a side chapel. The remains of an Adoration of the Magi from the 6th cent. are visible in the Cathedral of <ref type="cr">Bostra</ref>, in the Ḥawrān (S. Syria). A remarkable painting of the Enthroned Christ with angels still adorns the Temple of Bel in Palmyra, which was used as a Christian church. There are many other examples not so well preserved.</p>
<p>Following the Arab conquests, Christians continued to paint their churches and these paintings were reportedly much admired, even by Muslims. When ­<ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> fell to the Crusaders in 1099, eastern Christians, both within the occupied lands and outside of them, experienced what Leroy calls a ‘Renaissance’ in all aspects of their religious and cultural life (see ­<ref type="cr">Renaissance, Syriac</ref>). This growth is evident in their painted churches.</p>
<p>Fine paintings from the late 12th cent. adorn the walls of the Church of Sts. Sergios and Bacchos in <ref type="cr">Qara</ref>, Syria, and in the nearby Dayro d-Mor Yaʿqub. The little church of Mar Elian in <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref> still preserves paintings that have been damaged by recent restoration. There is an account of painters from the monastery of Mar Elian, in Qaryatayn, who came to paint churches in Lebanon and paintings have been restored in the chapel of Maʿarrat <cCase:All Caps>ṣ<cCase:>aydnāyā, near <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>. Wall paintings from the 13th  cent. also remain in the castles of Marqab and Crac des Chevaliers. Although the paintings in the castles were commissioned by the Crusaders, there is every indication that they were painted by local painters, trained in the Syr. tradition. The best preserved of the paintings in Syria are in <ref type="cr">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>, near Nabk (Syr. Orth.), where the walls of the chapel were elaborately painted on at least four different occasions in the 11th and 12th/13th cent.</p>
<p>By the end of the 12th cent., Christians of different communities, Syr. Orth., Ch. of E., Maron., Chald., Syr. Cath., Melk., and even Abyssinians and Copts had moved into Lebanon to profit from new opportunities in trade and commerce offered by the Crusader states. The liturgies of many of these churches in Lebanon were in Syriac. Fragments of church painting from the late 12th and 13th cent. in the mountains of Lebanon witness to a continuing tradition of church decoration during this period. In both Syria and Lebanon, the earlier paintings are inscribed in Greek, whereas by the 13th cent. the common language for the inscriptions was Syriac (mostly in Esṭrangela), Arabic (often in <ref type="cr">Garshuni</ref>), or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Churches decorated with outstanding paintings in Lebanon are the Church of Mar Phocas in <ref type="cr">Amyūn</ref>, Mar Saba in <ref type="cr">Eddé</ref>, Mar Tadros in <ref type="cr">Bahdeidat</ref>, Mar Charbel in <ref type="cr">Maʿad</ref>, and<ref type="cr"></ref>Sts. Sergios and Bacchos<ref type="cr"></ref>in<ref type="cr"> Kaftun</ref>. In addition, there are more than two dozen churches with fragmentary remains of painting on the walls. These paintings are all in the north of Lebanon, centered around the rich commercial area of Tripoli, in the Holy Valley of the Qadisha in the Lebanon range and in the lower foothills around Byblos and Batrun. Some of these paintings were hidden for many years under a coating of whitewash. Others remain untouched in the hermit caves by the river and under the cliffs of the Qadisha Gorge. Taken all together, they present an overview of the varied painterly tradition during the Crusader occupation, a tradition that survived into the Mamluk period. Paintings still exist also from the 16th and — until very recently — the 17th cent. Some of these paintings were destroyed in the last few years but have been recorded. The remainder are in precarious condition.</p>
<p>In Syria, this tradition of Christian painting was continued during Muslim rule. In Lebanon, the paintings indicate the rich and continuing tradition of Christian art in lands dominated by Crusaders. Both traditions are evidence of a flourishing Christian society that acted as liaison between Arabs and Franks. In this cultural ‘Renaissance’, the Syr. Orth. were especially prominent. In the 12th and 13th cent. they moved into Lebanon from the outlying areas of Damascus, <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, Diyarbakır (<ref type="cr">Amid</ref>), and <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, in order to occupy the monasteries behind Tripoli, taking over many Maronite establishments. The Mamluks allowed them to prosper in Lebanon, and they were joined by a further influx of monks from lands as distant as Abyssinia. By the end of the 15th cent., especially after 1488, the Maronites had assumed control of the Qadisha Valley and the adjacent mountainous areas. These areas remain largely Maronite today.</p>

</head><ab type="see-also"/></div><div type="entry"><head>Women in the Syriac Tradition
</LemmaTitle><p>Syriac Christianity from the beginning allotted women important positions as widows, deaconesses, and consecrated virgins; these roles were canonically named, ecclesiastically supervised, and granted significant responsibilities by the 3rd cent. Syriac churches also developed distinctive roles for women that differed from other Christian areas. Notable was the office of Covenanter, or Sons and Daughters of the Covenant (<i>bnay</i>and<i> bnāt qyāmā</i>; see <ref type="cr">bnay qyāmā</ref>), which appears during the 3rd cent. and continues at least into the 10th in both W.- and E.-Syr. churches. These were men and women who had taken vows of celibacy and simplicity, working in the service of the local bp. The rise of institutionalized <ref type="cr">monasticism</ref> in the 4th cent. did not eclipse their work. For the women, this office included the crucial task of singing doctrinal hymns (<i>madrāše</i>) in the liturgy of the civic churches. Later tradition ascribes the establishment of these women’s choirs to <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> himself.</p>
<p>No known Syriac text written by a woman survives until modern times, although the large corpus of anonymous Syriac hymnography and <ref type="cr">hagiography</ref> may include women’s contributions. Important Syriac women saints, both historical and legendary, gained renown in the Greek and Latin churches and sometimes beyond: Pelagia the Harlot of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, Mary the Niece of Abraham of Qidun, and Febronia of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> are among the best known. Furthermore, biblical women were often prominent in Syriac hymns and homilies, with stories much elaborated beyond the biblical text. Appreciation for the interconnection between biblical women and female saints may be seen in the Syriac ‘Book of Women’, containing the biblical books of Ruth, Esther, Judith, and Susanna as well as the ‘Book of Thecla’ (from the ‘Acts of Paul and Thecla’).</p>
<p>Additionally, ancient Syriac tradition produced striking feminine imagery for the divine, especially for the Holy Spirit (following grammar: <i>ruḥā</i>‘spirit’, being a feminine noun in Syriac). Perhaps related, devotion to the Virgin <ref type="cr">Mary</ref> was profoundly developed from an early stage in Syriac, anticipating by a century and more similar developments in Greek and Latin communities.</p>
<p>Female monasticism flourished in late antique Syriac Christianity, with an apparent encouragement of women’s literacy and learning. These declined quickly under Islamic domination, until modern times. Already in the early modern period, there is evidence of women’s leadership and patronage of religious learning in E.-Syr. communities. The holy woman Hindiyya, an 18th cent. Maronite nun in Lebanon, produced lengthy mystical writings in Arabic; the 20th cent. brought the renewal of Syriac women’s monastic communities in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq.

<p>Syriac and Arabic scholar. Born in north India, he was educated at St. Andrews University (Scotland), and subsequently studied at Halle with Emil Rödiger, and at Leiden with R. Dozy. He was appointed Professor of Arabic at University College, London in 1885, moving the next year to a similar chair at Trinity College, Dublin, where he remained till 1861, when he was appointed to a post in the British Museum, in order to catalogue the large collection of Syriac mss. acquired from <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>. Finally, in 1870, he was appointed as Sir Thomas Adam’s Professor of Arabic at Cambridge University. He was an enormously learned and productive scholar; in the Syriac field, besides his monumental <i>Catalogue of Syriac Manuscripts in the British Museum acquired since the year 1838</i> (3 vols.; 1870–2), followed (after his death) by 
<i>A Catalogue of the Syriac Manuscripts preserved in the Library of the University of Cambridge</i> (2 vols.; 1901), he edited a large number of important Syriac texts, including <i>Contributions to the Apocryphal Literature of the New Testament</i> (1865), <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>’s ‘Demonstrations’ (1869), the Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles (1871), the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Yeshuʿ the Stylite</ref>(1882), <ref type="cr">Kalila and Dimna</ref> (1884), and <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History (1898; with N.

<p>Ancient Chinese city in Shanxi Province. Located at the eastern terminus of the fabled Silk Route, Xi’an served as the capital of unified <ref type="cr">China</ref> periodically from the 
11th cent. BC through the Tang Dynasty (AD 618–907). By 635 the E.-Syr. missionary known as Aluoben had received permission from the Chinese emperor Taizong (627–49) to promote the Ch. of E. in his kingdom, using the capital as a base. The Christian movement appears to have flourished alongside other religions under a sort of imperial patronage until a Confucianist and Taoist repression against foreign religions occurred in the late Tang (ca. 846).</p>
<p>A black limestone stele inscribed in Syriac and Chinese by the Christian monk Jingjing (Syr. Adam) and dedicated in 781 was originally erected at the site of a Ch. of E. monastery, probably in the capital but possibly at a more remote location. It tells of Aluoben’s mission and the story of Christianity’s illustrious growth in China since 635. The Syriac inscription gives the names of 74 bishops, presbyters, and deacons working in China at the time; the Chinese inscription expounds on the Christian faith, using terms adapted to the Buddhist- and Taoist-influenced setting. Jesuit missionaries discovered the stele in 1623 or 1625 and exploited its antiquity for the promotion of Christianity in their own mission efforts. The content of the inscription has stimulated lively missiological discussion regarding the historical and appropriate contextualization of the Christian gospel.</p>

<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> and Cath. When Yahbalaha was elected, the Christians in the Persian Empire enjoyed the freedom accorded to them by Emperor Yazdgard I and formally laid down in the Synod of <ref type="cr">Isḥaq</ref> (410). This situation of tolerance must have continued under Isḥaq’s successor, Cath. Aḥai (410–15), about whom very little is known. Our main source about Yahbalaha’s tenure is the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>, which includes an account of the synod held in 419 or 420, shortly before Yahbalaha’s and Yazdgard’s death (420). Prior to the synod, Yahbalaha had been sent by Yazdgard as an ambassador to the Roman Empire ‘for the peace and the reconciliation of the two empires, which are the robust shoulders of the world’. The Roman Emperor (Theodosius II) responded to Yahbalaha’s mission by sending Aqaq of <ref type="cr">Amid</ref> to Persia. It is during Aqaq’s presence in the Persian capital that the synod was held, Aqaq playing a role similar to the one <ref type="cr">Marutha of Maypherqaṭ</ref> played at the synod of 410.</p>
<p>One important concern of the synod was to boost conformity among Christians in the two empires by adopting the canons issued at various synods in the Roman Empire. In the account of the synod it is said that the process of adjustment between the Christian communities in the two empires, begun in 410, had not been completed and that division and confusion had arisen. Since the account does not include canons, it cannot be ascertained which new rules were introduced, even though there is reason to assume that on this occasion Greek canonical collections were in fact brought to the Ch. of E. The fact that only twelve signatures are found (as compared to the 38 signatures for the 410 synod) may indicate that the synod was not widely supported. Its limited success may also be due to Yazdgard’s changing attitude toward the Christians and to the resumption of persecution around 419. This was a prelude to renewed warfare between the two empires (421–22) and created an atmosphere of crisis, in which Yahbalaha’s successor <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref> convened the synod of 424.</p>

<p>Mar Yahbalaha III, an ethnic Uighur and a monk of the Ch. of E., was born in the vicinity of Khān Bālīq (Beijing). As a young monk, he took the name Markos and became devoted to his spiritual master, <ref type="cr">Ṣawma</ref>. Sometime around 1275 the two of them set out on a pilgrimage with the intention of visiting <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>. In spite of travel permits from Kublai Khan, the two encountered numerous difficulties before reaching <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> and meeting with the Cath. of the Ch. of E., Mar Denḥa. When the Cath. died (1281), Markos was chosen as his successor and took the name Mar Yahbalaha III. His electors may have hoped that by raising someone from the East to the patriarchal throne they would gain some advantage with their Mongol overlords.</p>
<p>Mar Yahbalaha is remembered for his efforts to establish diplomatic contacts with the Mongols and for his defense of the Ch. of E. against harassment and massacres by local Muslim rulers. Despite valiant efforts, Yahbalaha witnessed the decimation of his Church. A particularly savage massacre of Christians took place at Arbil (<ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>). These sad events in the history of the Ch. of E. were recorded by Ṣawma who also kept a record of his diplomatic mission to Christian Europe. The story of Mar Yahbalaha first became known in the English-speaking world in 1928. In that year the British orientalist E. A. Wallis Budge published his <i>Monks of Kublai Khan, Emperor of China</i>.</p>

<Author>J. P. Amar</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</head><ab type="infobox"/>(893/4–974) [Syr. Orth.]
<p>Translator, philosopher, logician, and theologian. His full name is Abū Zakariyyā Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī b. Ḥamīd b. Zakariyyā (some mss. copied in Iran add: b. Yaḥyā b. ʿUthmān b. Ḥamīd b. Buzurjmihr). He was born in 893/4 in <ref type="cr">Tagrit</ref>and spent most of his adult life in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>. He died 13 Aug. 974 at the age of 81 and was buried in the church of Mār Tūmā in Baghdad. He was a student of the Ch. of E. philosopher Abū Bishr Mattā b. Yūnus (d. ca. 940) and the celebrated Muslim philosopher Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī (d. ca. 9<ab type="infobox"/>50). Yaḥyā had a number of prominent students, both Christians and Muslims. His Christi<ab type="infobox"/>an students include Abū ʿAlī ʿĪsā b. Zurʿa (d. 1008) and al-Ḥasan b. Suwār b. al-Khammār (d. after 1017), the latter of whom instructed <ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref>(d. 1<ab type="infobox"/>043). His Muslim students include Abū Sulaymān al-Sijistānī (d. ca. 985), ʿĪsā b. ʿAlī (d. 1001; to be distinguished from the Syriac lexicographer <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar ʿAli</ref>), and Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī (d. 1023). Like his contemporary Ibn al-Nadīm (fl. 987), who wrote the <i>Kitāb al-Fihrist</i>, Yaḥyā was a professional scribe and bookseller in Baghdad. He is, however, better known as the master of philosophy of his time.</p>
<p>Yaḥyā’s <i>oeuvre</i>includes more than 130 items, all in Arabic, that span the fields of philosophy, logic, metaphysics, ethics, physics and mathematics, and theology (an indispensible inventory is provided by Endress 1977 with important additions and corrections by Samir 1979). Following in the tradition of <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873), Yaḥyā edited, translated (often via Syriac), and commented on many Greek philosophical texts. Chief among these were the works of <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>, especially the ‘Topics’ and ‘Physics’. Yaḥyā was, however, also an author in his own right. One of his more important works is his <i>Maqāl fī al-tawḥīd</i>‘Discourse on unity’ (ed. Kh.  Samir 1980), in which he defines the unity of God in such a way as to affirm monotheism (important to his Muslim audience) while maintaining three attributes of God, namely goodness, wisdom, and power (pointing to a Trinitarian understanding of God). In addition to his writings on logic and philosophy, Yaḥyā was a prolific author in Christian theology with many of his works being of an apologetic nature. Some of his apologetic writings are directed against the Muslim <i>mutakallimūn</i> with whom he was in regular contact (see <ref type="cr">Islam, Syriac contacts with</ref>). Yaḥyā, for instance, wrote a lengthy response to the <i>Kitāb fī</i><i> al-radd ʿalā al-firaq al-thalāth min al-naṣārā</i>‘Refutation of the three sects of the Christians’ by Abū ʿĪsā Muḥammad b. Hārūn al-Warrāq (d. ca. 862) (ed. Platti 1987). Yaḥyā also wrote apologetic works against the Ch. of E. in which he defended the Christological formulation of the Syr. Orth. Church (see, e.g., Platti 1981–1982, 1983). Finally, mention should be made of Yaḥyā’s<i> Tahdhīb al-akhlāq</i>‘The Reformation of Morals’ (Arabic with ET Griffith 2002), which is one of the earliest and most important works on ethics in Arabic literature.</p>

<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> and learned author. Born in <ref type="cr">Barṭelle</ref>, his baptismal name was probably Yaʿqub. He studied grammar under <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref> in the famous E.-Syr. monastery of Beth Qoqe (in <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref>), and philosophy under Kāmāl al-Dīn Mūsā b.

He was first a monk and subsequently abbot and bp. of the Dayro d-Mor Matay, with the episcopal name Severos (according to Schrier, however, Severos was his baptismal name and Yaʿqub his episcopal one, but this would seem surprising). His surviving writings consist of 1. ‘The Book of Treasures’, a theological compendium in four parts, composed in 1231; this covers the Trinity, the Incarnation, Divine Providence, and the Creation; 2. ‘The Book of Dialogues’, in two Books, the first of which covers grammar, rhetoric, poetry, and eloquence (on the richness of the Syriac language), while the second deals with philosophical topics, divided into two parts, the first covering logic and syllogisms, the second with sections on definitions, ethics, physics and physiology, mathematics and music, and metaphysics; 3. two verse letters addressed to physicians; and perhaps 4. a symbol of faith. He also wrote some other works, now lost; these included a commentary on the liturgical services.</p>

<Author>S. P. Brock</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</head><ab type="infobox"/>Jacob Baradaeus (d. 578) [Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (542–78) and missionary. Born in Tella, and educated in the nearby monastery of Phesilta. In 527/8 he was sent to Constantinople to look after the interests of the Miaphysites. In Constantinople Justinian’s wife <ref type="cr">Theodora</ref> had put the Palace of Hormisdas at the disposal of the considerable number of Miaphysite refugees who had gathered there. In 542/3, when the Ghassanid leader, Ḥārith b. Gabala, asked Theodora for some bishops to look after the non-Chalcedonian commmunities, Yaʿqub and Theodore were secretly consecrated in Constantinople by <ref type="cr">Theodosius</ref>, Patr. of Alexandria, and were designated as bishops of Edessa and of (the Ghassanid) <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref>. Yaʿqub subsequently played an important role in providing for the pastoral needs of Miaphysite communities all over the Near East; often pursued by the imperial authorities, he travelled in disguise, whence his nickname <i>burdʿoyo</i> ‘(dressed in) saddle-cloth’, Hellenized as <i>Baradaios</i> (the back formation of ‘Bar Adai’ is due to a modern misinterpretation). Towards the end of his life he was much involved in the opposition to <ref type="cr">Pawlos of Beth Ukomo</ref> (Paul ‘the Black’; Patr. from 564 to 577) and in the ‘Tritheist’ controversy.</p>
<p>The two main biographical accounts are: 1. <ref type="cr">Yuḥa­non of Ephesus</ref>’ ‘Lives of Eastern Saints’, ch. 49–50 (ed. Brooks, <i>PO</i> 18, 488–95 and <i>PO</i> 19, 499–504); and 2. a longer anonymous Life (also in Brooks, <i>PO</i> 19, 574–614). The latter in particular attributes to him an exaggerated number of ordinations. Writing from a European perspective, and influenced by the subsequent hostile designation of the Syr. Orth. as ‘Jacobites’, Kleyn described Yaʿqub as ‘the founder of the Monophysite Church’. While undoubtedly he played a very important role, along with Theodore, in ensuring the survival of the Syriac (and other) communities who were opposed to the imperial religious policy which sought to impose the Chalcedonian Definition on the Church, he should better be seen as someone motivated primarily by pastoral concerns.</p>
<p>Nine letters written by him (sometimes alongside others) are preserved in a ms. containing a large number of miaphysite texts (ed. Chabot); other texts under his name are an Anaphora, a profession of faith, and a homily on the Annunciation preserved only in Arabic translation; the authenticity of the last two, in particular, is doubtful (the homily is also transmitted under the name of Patr. <ref type="cr">Nuḥ the Lebanese</ref>!).</p>
<p>His liturgical commemoration is on 31 July.</p>

<p>Bp. of<ref type="cr"> Edessa</ref> (ca. 684–9, 708) and scholar. Born in the village of ʿEn Deba in the district of Gumya, in the province of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. He entered the monastery of <ref type="cr">John bar Aphtonia</ref> in <ref type="cr">Qenneshre</ref> on the upper Euphrates, where he studied the Scriptures and Greek, and spent some years in Alexandria. The remainder of his life was spent in the region of Syria which was by then under Muslim control. He was ordained by his friend the Patr. <ref type="cr">Athanasios of Balad</ref> and in ca. 684 was appointed bp. of Edessa. However, he resigned after only a few years over what he regarded as a lax attitude to canon law with which he refused to compromise. He made a public demonstration of his position by burning a copy of the canons in front of the residence of the Patr. Yulyanos. He then went to the Monastery of Mor Yaʿqub at Kaysum, near Samosata, and wrote two treatises, one of them against those who broke canon law. Subsequently he was invited to the Monastery of Eusebona to teach the Psalms and the reading of Scripture in Greek: although he was a Syriac-speaker and wrote exclusively in Syriac, Yaʿqub was an enthusiastic proponent of Greek language, literature, and Miaphysite theology. But after eleven years he was forced to leave because of the anti-Greek attitude prevalent in the convent. He moved on to the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Tell ʿAda</ref> along with his disciples and worked on his revision of the Old Testament. In 708 Ḥabbib, who had replaced Yaʿqub as bp. of Edessa, died, and Yaʿqub was recalled to the bishopric. However, he himself died only four months later on 5 June at Tell ʿAda, to which he had returned in order to fetch his library and students. He was buried there, and miracles were said to have been performed at his tomb.</p>
<p>Yaʿqub was a polymath, and although some of his works have failed to survive, many were very influential in the Syr. Orth. Church. His literary works include:</p>
<p>1. A revision and annotation of earlier Syriac translations of the Greek ‘Cathedral Homilies’ and ‘Okto­echos’ of the Miaphysite scholar <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref>. Completed ca. 701.</p>
<p>2. Yaʿqub’s ‘Hexaemeron’, the first Syriac work to describe the world from the perspective of the biblical creation account. Unfinished at the time of Yaʿqub’s death and completed by his friend <ref type="cr">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>.</p>
<p>3. Many letters on matters ranging from canon law to bible interpretation. Yaʿqub’s correspondents include <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon the Stylite of Litarba</ref> near <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>, Pawlos of Antioch, Eustathios of Dara, Qurisona of Dara, the priest Abrohom, the deacon Gewargis, the sculptor Toma, and Barḥadbshabba.</p>
<p>4. A revision of the Old Testament text, which survives for the Pentateuch, Sam, Is, Dan, and Wisd. It seems to be a hybrid of the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>, Septuagint, and Syro-Hexapla texts, perhaps with the aim of supplementing the Syriac tradition.</p>
<p>5. Commentaries on the Bible, but these only survive as scholia in catenae and ms. collections.</p>
<p>6. Works on canon law, including a treatise on the forbidden degrees of affinity. Yaʿqub’s interpretations are also found in a question and answer series addressed to the priest Addai.</p>
<p>7. A chronicle covering the period from the end of <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History to his own time (ca. 692). Unfortunately most of this work has perished, but it was used in the 11th cent. by the E. Syr. chronographer <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref>.</p>
<p>8. A handbook of philosophical terms, the ‘Encheiridion’.</p>
<p>9. The first systematic Syriac grammar. It survives only in fragmentary form, but it was an important influence on <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s grammatical work. In the examples he gave of grammatical rules, Yaʿqub used Greek vowel letters inserted into the consonantal text (similar forms can be found in his Sam ms.), and this method was modified by his successors to become the now familiar W.-Syr. system. Yaʿqub also wrote a letter to Giwargis bp. of Serugh on orthography.</p>
<p>10. Liturgical works: Yaʿqub revised the liturgy of St. James, wrote the ‘Book of Treasures’ which included orders and prayers for baptism, consecration of the waters on the eve of Epiphany, and marriage. He translated the <i>Sedro</i> of Severus for baptism, and composed a horologium with services for the hours of the week, and a calendar of feast days.</p>
<p>11. Several prose homilies: on the Eucharistic sacrifice, unleavened bread, against Dyophysites, and against transgressors of canon law. Two metrical homilies, on the Trinity and Incarnation, and on Faith against the Ch. of E., have been attributed to Yaʿqub, but his authorship of the latter is disputed.</p>

<p>First recorded bp. of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref>. Although Yaʿqub’s name appears in a variety of late antique sources, trustworthy historical data about him are quite limited. The closest we have to an eye-witness report of Yaʿqub are the ‘Nisibene Hymns’ (13–16: CSCO 218–219) of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>. In the Hymns, which were most likely written ca. 359, Yaʿqub is identified as ‘Father’ of the church of Nisibis, to which ‘he gave birth and whose infancy he nourished with milk’ (14:21). Yaʿqub reared the church, ‘dealing with her as a child, loving her, and teaching her piety’ (14:18). Yaʿqub, who was known for his eloquence (14:15) may have been an early example for Ephrem in his subsequent role as teacher and poet. Finally, Yaʿqub’s burial place in Nisibis ‘protected Nisibis ... during the time of her pruning’ (13:19–20). Yaʿqub may well have been recognized as a charismatic figure even before his death. It was this early reputation which laid the groundwork for Armenian and Greek legends that came to dominate his historical memory: while no authentic works were preserved under his name, he would be identified as the author of the ‘Demonstrations’ now known to be the work of <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, of apocryphal Letters addressed to Cath. <ref type="cr">Papa</ref> of Seleucia, and of the spurious ‘Canons of Nicea’. In Armenian tradition he came to be revered as a founder of <ref type="cr">Armenian Christianity</ref> and a relative of Gregory the Illuminator. Yaʿqub is also widely seen as one of the bps. who participated in the Council of Nicea (325).</p>
<p>Historiographical problems relating to the figure of Yaʿqub are complicated by the elaboration of what purport to be historical reports from the 4th and 5th cent. Alongside the quite generalized remarks of Ephrem, the reports of <ref type="cr">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref>, in the ‘History of the monks of Syria’, and of Gennadius, in the ‘Epic Histories’, contributed to the subsequent legend of Yaʿqub as a holy man and a model of the episcopacy. This material, which is more of the nature of <ref type="cr">hagiography</ref> than history, is nonetheless important for tracing the development of traditions related to the growing cult of Yaʿqub and to tensions surrounding the emerging concept of the episcopacy.</p>

<p>Poet, known as ‘the Flute of the Holy Spirit and the Harp of the Church’; bp. of Baṭnan da-Srug (519–21). Most of the little information about his life comes from two notices (ed. Assemani, <i>BibOr</i>, vol. 1, 286–9, and Abbeloos, <i>De vita et scriptis Jacobi...</i> [1867], 311–2); there are also two panegyrics (ed. Krüger, <i>OC</i> 56 [1972]) and a late Biography. An outline based on all these sources was compiled by P. Y. Dolabani (<i>Swodo mpaygono…</i> [Mardin, 1952]).</p>
<p>Born in Kurtam, on the Euphrates, his poetic gifts became evident early on. He was a student at the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref>, and this explains the appearance in his <i>mimre</i> of some exegetical traditions that go back to <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. At an unknown date he was appointed Chorepiscopos of Ḥawra, and then at the age of 67 he was consecrated bp. of Baṭnan in 519 by Pawlos bp. of Edessa. The date of his death is given as 29 Nov. 521 in the notice published in <i>BibOr</i>, and this is the date of his liturgical commemoration; other sources, however, give different dates (and even a different year, 520; see Vööbus, <i>Handschr. Überlieferung</i>, vol. 1, 4). A contemporary source (‘Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Yeshuʿ the Stylite</ref>’, 54) states that, at the time of the Persian invasion of north Mesopotamia (502/3), ‘the respected Yaʿqub, the periodeutes, who composed many <i>mimre</i> on Scriptural passages, and <i>sugyoto</i> and <i>zmiroto</i> ... wrote letters’ of encouragement to different cities.</p>
<p>Yaʿqub is primarily known for his verse <i>memre</i> in the 12-syllable metre (which is named after him); these are said to have numbered 763. At least 380 survive, and over half of these have been edited by P. Bedjan. The majority of these are highly imaginative expositions of biblical passages; a number of others deal with saints (e.g. <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, George, etc.). The attribution of some <i>mimre</i> remains uncertain: thus that on the myron is also attributed to <ref type="cr">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>; definitely not by Yaʿqub, despite the attribution, is the <i>mimro</i> on <ref type="cr">Alexander</ref> (ed. Reinink, CSCO 454–5). 
A number of <i>madroše</i> and <i>sugyoto</i> in mss. are also attributed to him, at least some of which are very probably genuinely his.</p>
<p>Yaʿqub’s prose writings consist of 1. six <i>turgome</i>, or prose homilies, for Nativity, Epiphany, Lent, Palm Sunday (Hosanna), Good Friday and the Resurrection; 2. Lives of holy men of his own lifetime, Daniel of Galash and Hannina (unpublished; summaries by F. Nau, in <i>ROC</i>15 [1910], 60–64); and 3. a collection of 43 Letters (not all of which are complete).</p>
<p>Various liturgical texts are attributed to Yaʿqub, in particular, three Anaphoras (ed. H. G. Codrington, in <i>Anaphorae Syriacae</i>, II.1 [1951]) and the Maronite baptismal rite (ed. A. Mouhanna [OCA 212; 1980]). Though the attibutions are uncertain, these texts share many themes to be found in Yaʿqub’s <i>mimre</i>. Liturgical <i>boʿawoto</i> are attributed to Yaʿqub, as well as to Ephrem and <ref type="cr">Balai</ref> (depending on their meter); some of those attributed to Yaʿqub are just excerpts from his <i>mimre</i>. Likewise, many <i>bote d-ḥašo</i> (ed. Strothmann [GOFS 32; 1989]) are adapted from Yaʿqub’s <i>mimre</i> (see <i>JSS</i> 36 [1991], 201–4). Surprisingly, a passage from Yaʿqub’s <i>turgomo</i> for the Resurrection is to be found in the <i>Ḥudr</i><i>ā</i> (ed. Darmo, vol. 2, 553–4; see <i>OCP</i> 55 [1989], 339–43).</p>
<p>Yaʿqub is commemorated on 29 Nov. in both the Syr. Orth. and the Maron. Calendar. Although Assemani and others have claimed that Yaʿqub was Chalcedonian, it is now known that he objected to the Council of Chalcedon: this is clear from some of his Letters and from a <i>mimro</i> (probably genuine) lamenting the Council. Basically, Yaʿqub disliked the analytic approach to theology current in the controversy that followed the Council of 451; his preference was for the theology of symbol and paradox that characterised Ephrem’s approach.</p>
<p>The appreciation with which Yaʿqub’s <i>mimre</i> have always been held is indicated by the large number of mss. containing them. The oldest of these go back to the 6th cent., while several mss. of the 11th to 13th cent. contain huge collections, sometimes with well over 200 <i>memre</i>. There are also translations into Armenian, Arabic, Ethiopic (by way of Arabic), and Georgian.</p>

[Ch. of E.]
<p>Cath. (552–67), successor of Mar <ref type="cr">Aba I</ref>, in a period of tension between the Church and the Persian authorities. Yawsep is primarily known as the convener of the Synod of 554, a report of which is preserved in the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. Following an introductory narrative (in which Yawsep speaks in the 1st pers. sing., and refers to the internal and external problems faced by the Church) and a brief profession of faith (ET in Brock), the report contains 23 canons aiming at restoring order and discipline in the hierarchy of the church and warning against possible abuses by the cath., the bishops, the priests, and the laypeople. Even though the report reflects the difficult circumstances of Yawsep’s first years, there is no evidence of controversies surrounding the person of the Cath. As a matter of fact, the E.-Syr. sources agree that during the first three years of his tenure Yawsep ruled with dignity. After three years, however, he is said to have become arrogant and to have given himself over to all sorts of misbehavior as well as to simony. This eventually led the metropolitans and bps. to depose Yawsep, with the consent of Emperor Khusrau, whose favor Yawsep had at first enjoyed. It is unclear whether Yawsep’s successor, <ref type="cr">Ḥazqiel</ref>, was appointed immediately after his deposal (567), or only three years later, after Yawsep’s death.</p>
<p><ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, who appears to be well-informed about this episode, reports that ‘according to some’ Yawsep, upon his deposal, composed apocryphal letters under the names of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> and <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, written in support of <ref type="cr">Papa bar ʿAggai</ref><LemmaTitle> who, in the early 4th cent. had been deposed for reasons of abuse of power. Yawsep would thus have retrojected his own experience into that of Papa, claiming with the help of the forged letters that he, just like Papa, was innocent. It should be noted, however, that Yawsep cannot possibly have been the author of the entire dossier of the Papa letters, since some of them already existed, and were read, at the synod of</LemmaTitle><ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref><LemmaTitle> (424).</p>
</LemmaTitle><p><LemmaTitle>A more positive note is appended to the lengthy discussion on Yawsep in the Chronicle of</LemmaTitle><ref type="cr">Siirt</ref><LemmaTitle> (185–86). The author quotes the historian Bar Sahde (ca. 600?) for noticing that when the plague struck, Yawsep devoted himself to burying the dead who were lying in the streets, adding Bar Sahde’s comment that this was Yawsep’s only meritorious deed. Finally, in a brief fragment, of uncertain origin, published by Mingana under the name of</LemmaTitle><ref type="cr">Barḥadbshabba</ref><LemmaTitle> (ET in Becker), Yawsep is portrayed as a strong opponent of the</LemmaTitle><ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref><LemmaTitle>, ‘which he hated’.</p>

<p>Ṣliba d-beth Maʿrūf was born in <ref type="cr">Telkepe</ref>, where he was ordained a deacon at the age of fifteen. In 1689, he moved to Diyarbakır (<ref type="cr">Amid</ref>), where he became the disciple of Patr. Yawsep I, who ordained him a priest and later Metropolitan of Diyarbakır. In 1696, he succeeded Yawsep I as the next <ref type="cr">Chaldean Catholic</ref> Patr. of ‘Babylon of the Chaldeans’ under the name of Yawsep  II. In Diyarbakır, he attended one of the local Muslim schools, where he studied Arabic, philosophy, and some theology. Besides his activities as Bp. and Patr., he copied mss. and wrote a number of theological, liturgical, and poetical works in Syriac, <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref>, and Arabic. He entertained close relations with the Latin missionaries, who had made Diyarbakır one of the important centers of their missionary activities. This explains the many European influences on his theological thinking. On the other hand, he also had a thorough knowledge of the Syriac literary tradition, which is, however, less reflected in his theological writings. Yawsep II can be considered as one of the Chald. theologians who substantially contributed to the partial Latinization of his community in the fields of liturgy, spirituality, and dogma.</p>
<p>His most important works are: 1. ‘The Joy of the Just and the Medicine of the Sinners’ (<i>rwā</i><i>zā d-kene w-sammā d-ḥaṭṭāye</i>), originally in Arabic, translated by himself into Syriac. This work is based on the ideas of the Spanish Jesuit Eusebio Nieremberg y Ottín, who enjoyed great popularity among Latin missionaries; 2. The ‘Enlightening Lamp’ (<i>lampedā nuhrānā</i>), also translated from Arabic into Syriac, a compendium of the Roman Catholic ‘Ecumenical’ Councils till Ferrara-Florence (1439); 3. A ‘Book of Logic’ (<i>ktābā d-logiqi aw d-mallilutā</i>), originally in Arabic and translated by Yawsep into Syriac; 4. The extremely popular in Chaldean circles ‘Book of the Magnet’, a devotional-moral handbook, the Syriac text of which goes back to Arabic sources, which were basically translations of Latin devotional works; 5. The equally popular ‘Polished Mirror’ (<i>maḥziṭā mriqtā</i>), in both Arabic and Syriac, a dogmatic work against the ‘Jacobites’ and the ‘Nestorians’, as appears from the Arabic title. It is essentially a defense of the Catholic dogma and the primacy of the Pope, again based on Latin sources.</p>
<p>Yawsep also composed a number of liturgical works, a <i>penqitā</i> and a <i>gazzā</i>, in which he introduced some Latin feasts and commemorations (<i>dukrāne</i>) of saints, as well as an Explanation of the ecclesiastical services (<i>puššāq tešmšātā ʿedtānāyāt</i><i>ā</i>). In the spiritual field, he wrote a <i>memrā</i> on spiritual exile, <i>aksnāyutā</i>, added some verses to <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s <i>memrā</i> ‘On Perfection’ (his famous <i>memrā zawgān</i><i>āyā</i>), and composed a commentary on the latter’s <i>memrā</i> ‘On Divine Wisdom’. Finally, he is the author of a great number of poetical compositions of different genres (<ref type="cr">dorekyātā</ref>, <i>turgāme</i>, <i>madrāše</i>), both in Syriac and Sureth. As Patr. of a Uniate Church he had an elaborate correspondence with Rome, which is partly preserved, e.g. a Roman Catholic profession of faith, sent to the Pope (in Arabic).</p>

<p>Printer, educator, and scholar. Yawsep came from the village of Marbishu in <ref type="cr">Hakkari</ref>. He was educated by the English mission in <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref> and ordained deacon ca. 1894 by the Matran Mar Isḥaq Ḥenanishoʿ. He taught in the mission school, copied manuscripts (the earliest of his copies for one of the mission clergy, David Jenks, is dated 1891), prepared texts for the press, and learned practical <ref type="cr">printing</ref>. In 1901 he left for the United States (where his activities are unrecorded), but had returned to Urmia by 1906 when an article on divorce law under his name was published in the first issue of the newspaper <i>Kawkba</i>. In 1909 he was the secretary of the ‘Patriarchal Church Committee’ in Urmia. In 1910 he went to England and formed a connection with the Trinitaran Bible Society of London, who reprinted the Urmia edition of the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref> Old Testament under his nominal editorship, and supported his ‘Bible Training School’ in Qurana in Tergawar.</p>
<p>Yawsep’s career as a printer had three phases: 1. In Urmia, using the Anglican press, he printed the ‘Paradise of Eden’ (1916) and the <i>Nomocanon</i> of <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>(1918). 2. In <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, he set up the ‘Assyrian Press’, using money collected from the Assyrians in the Baʿqūba refugee camp in 1919. This collection enabled him to go to India with his cousin Mar <ref type="cr">Abimalek Timotheus</ref>and supervise the cutting of Syriac type there. A price-list of publications shows 16 finished books published ca. 1921–28, including school and religious texts, the most important of the latter being the <ref type="cr">Qdām w-Bāthar</ref> (1923), <i>Margānitā</i> (1924), <i>Ṭaksā</i> (1928), and ‘Paradise of Eden’ (1928). (A <i>Ḥudrā</i> and large Syriac-English dictionary were never finished.) Following Yawsep’s ordination as priest in 1927 by Mar Timotheus (then a figure of opposition to the patriarchal family), <ref type="cr">Eshai Shemʿ<ref type="cr">on</ref> confiscated the equipment of the Assyrian Press in 1928. 3. Yawsep re-equipped his press with locally available types. In 1934 he named his business the ‘Diqlath Press’ and continued to work it until his death in 1952. The publications of this press are not well documented.</p>
<p>As a schoolmaster and scholar, Yawsep had his greatest influence through his ‘Assyrian School’ for boys in Mosul, which he conducted in the same building as the press. The next generation of educated Assyrians were largely his old pupils, making him the ‘father of modern (As)syrian literature in Iraq’ (Macuch). Yawsep was not a critical scholar but a learned and staunch defender of the traditions of the Ch. of E. He drew up the Church’s official patriarchal list (printed as an appendix to the <i>Margānitā</i>) at the behest of Mar Shemʿon in 1</ref>924.</p>

or ‘The Visionary’ (8th cent.) [Ch. of E.] 
<p>Theologian, abbot, and solitary of the Ch. of E., who has been viewed as the systematizer of the mystical and ascetic life for the Syriac-speaking churches. The primary source for Yawsep’s life is ‘The Book of Chastity’ by <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>of Baṣra (ca. 868–70). Yawsep was born to Persian Zoroastrian parents in the village of Nimrud early in the 8th cent. (ca. 710?). After the village rebelled against Caliph ʿUmar b. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz (r. 717–20), the latter retaliated, and soldiers captured the seven-year-old Yawsep, eventually selling him as a slave to an Arab, then later to a Christian of Qardu in present-day northern Iraq. Impressed by the life of the monks of the nearby monastery of Yoḥannan of Kamul, Yawsep asked to be baptized and was allowed to enter at a young age into the monastery of Abba Ṣliba in <ref type="cr">Beth Nuhadra</ref> in northern Iraq. After the obligatory novitiate in the cenobitic community, Yawsep established himself as a hermit in Qardu for a number of years. Later he was made the head of the monastery of Mar Bassima, also in Qardu, but eventually he returned to the eremitic life in the mountain of Zinai in <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref> of northeast Iraq. In the neighborhood of his hermitage was another monastery, that of Rabban Bakhtishoʿ, and before long Yawsep was persuaded to become their abbot, remaining until his death. <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (d. 1318) said that Yawsep had written an incredible number of works, 1900 in total, but only ten were extant by ʿAbdishoʿ’s time. His most systematic work, ‘A letter on the three stages of the monastic life’, was not positively identified as his work until the last thirty years. In the ms. tradition it was attributed to <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>, but a number of items in and about the text had raised questions about its authorship for quite some time. A synod called in 786–787 by the Patr. of the Ch. of E. <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> condemned a trio of writers — <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>, <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref>, and Yawsep Ḥazzaya — for some of their theological ideas. Yawsep was accused of messalianist tendencies, supposedly claiming that it is necessary to reject prayer and the office in order to receive the gifts of the Spirit. Allied to this is the alleged doctrine that the <i>gmirā</i> (the perfect or mature person) no longer has any need of active prayer, the offices, reading, or manual labor. Neither charge has any substantive foundation in the known writings of Yawsep. The synod denied the possibility of perfection for human nature, except for that of Christ.</p>

<p>Maqryānā in the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> at the end of the 5th and/or in the first half of the 6th cent. In this position Yawsep was in charge of teaching correct reading and the first level of interpretation. Later sources present him as <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>’s successor as director of the School, but this is contradicted by contemporary sources. No further information on Yawsep’s life is available, except the fact that he was from Beth Huzaye, as his name indicates, i.e., Huzistan, the ancient region of Susiana.</p>
<p>A note in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,138, dated to 899 and containing an E.-Syr. <ref type="cr">Masora</ref>, points to Yawsep as the inventor of the nine ‘accents’ or punctuation signs (f. 312v), which are preserved in the later tradition with some variation. They mark the division of the sentence and prescribe the tone of the pronunciation (particularly in interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory clauses) as well as the rhythm of the recitation. Whether Yawsep invented them or rather adapted and systematized a pre-existing system remains uncertain. In any case, Yawsep’s contribution to establishing the correct reading and pronunciation of Classical Syriac in the E.-Syr. tradition must have been significant, even if <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s remark that Yawsep ‘changed the Edessene reading (<i>qrāytā</i>) into the eastern one prevailing among the Nestorians’ may be an exaggeration.</p>
<p>In addition, Bar ʿEbroyo mentions Yawsep as the author of a work on homographs (i.e. words written with the same consonants, but having a different pronunciation and meaning), which may have been the first in this genre. Unfortunately it has not been preserved. Moreover, Yawsep’s name is connected with the Syriac translation of the <i>Technè Grammatikè</i>, an influential Greek work on grammar written by <ref type="cr">Dionysius Thrax</ref> 
(ca. 170 – ca. 90 BC). Whereas the E.-Syr. mss. are explicit in ascribing the translation to Yawsep and are supported in this by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>, the work is anonymous in the W.-Syr. tradition.</p>

[W. Syr.] 
<p>Author, possibly pseudonymous, of an important an­onymous historical text bearing the title ‘A historical narrative of the period of distress which occurred in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>, and all Mesopotamia’. The period in question is the years 494–506, during which Edessa suffered famine and plague (494–502) and the region experienced a Persian invasion and a Roman-Persian war (502–506). The work was almost certainly written, in Edessa, shortly after the end of this war. A single sentence before the epilogue alludes to the last years of the emperor Anastasius (d. 518), but this is generally thought to be a later scribal insertion.</p>
<p>The manner of the text’s transmission is responsible for the uncertainty regarding the author’s identity. It is not preserved by itself in any ms., but only as a section of the much larger <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>, also known as the Chronicle of (Pseudo-) Dionysios of Tel Maḥre, itself preserved in a single ms. (Vat. Syr. 162). One folio in this section of the ms. is from a later scribe, who identified himself as Elishaʿ, from the monastery of Zuqnin, and requested God’s mercy not only for himself, but also for ‘the priest Mar Yeshuʿ the stylite, from the convent of Zuqnin, who wrote <i>ktobo hono d-ʿuhdono hono</i> of the bad times which have passed and of the calamities and troubles which that tyrant inflicted among men’. From this scribal note, which has been translated and understood in several different ways, Yeshuʿ has been variously interpreted as the scribe of the ms., the author of the entire Chronicle of Zuqnin (or both scribe and author), or the author (or an early scribe) of the discreet section devoted to the period 494–506. If the Yeshuʿ referred to here is in reality the author or scribe of the whole Chronicle of Zuqnin, he must have lived sometime after 775 (the date at which it ends); in that case ‘the calamities and troubles which that tyrant inflicted among men’ cannot refer to the Persian king Kawad who invaded Roman territory in 502, but must be related to events in the 8th cent. Irrespective of the resolution of this problem, however, references to ‘Yeshuʿ the stylite’ in scholarly literature are invariably directed to the narrative of 494–506, although for this reason such references are sometimes given as ‘Pseudo-Yeshuʿ’.</p>
<p>The narrative of 494–506 is the earliest extant work of Syriac <ref type="cr">historiography</ref>. Usually designated ‘The Chronicle of (Pseudo-) Yeshuʿ the stylite’, it falls into different sections, and to some extent different genres. While the first main section is indeed a chronicle, giving a year-by-year account of the locust plague, famine and epidemic in Edessa in 494–502, the other main section, a narrative of the Roman-Persian war of 502–6, is more akin to the genre of a political history, as is the account of Persian-Roman relations preceding the war, placed by the author in front of the chronicle of plague in Edessa. There is a highly rhetorical prologue and epilogue addressed to a (real or fictitious) abbot named Sergios. The work is an astonishingly rich source for the historian of late antiquity. Conditions of life in Edessa, including economic conditions, are described in great detail, and it is the fullest and most accurate account in any language of the war with which it deals.</p>

In Syriac Yoḥannan authored ‘Canons and admonitions (<i>zuhhāre</i>) of the altar service’; in Arabic a treatise on ‘Principles’ (<i>fi al-usūl</i>) and a Letter on the Fast of the Ninevites. In addition, a work on ‘Juridical decisions and rules for division of inheritance’ based on Islamic law is attested for him. This may perhaps be identical with a collection known in present-day scholarship as ‘Syriac texts on Islamic Law’, which is transmitted in both the E.- and W.-Syr. tradition as well as in an Arabic translation. While a marginal note in the Arabic translation attributes the work to Yoḥannan, the E.-Syr. mss. transmit it anonymously, and W.-Syr. mss. attribute it either to a Patr.

<p>Author of a summary history of the world. Evidently from Penek in Beth Zabdai, he became a monk of the Monastery of Yoḥannan of Kamul, and later, a solitary attached to that of Mar Bassima. His main work is the <i>Ktābā d-reš melle</i>‘Book of the main events’, a history of the world in 15 Books, ending up with his own time. 
A verse treatise on monastic life by him is also preserved, as well as two ‘Centuries’ which evidently belong to a work entitled ‘The (spiritual) Merchant’, mentioned by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> in his ‘Catalogue’ (he also lists some other works which have disappeared).

<p>Teacher of biblical interpretation at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>. Yoḥannan was a relative of <ref type="cr">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref> and both he <ab type="infobox"/>and Abraham were probably related to <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>, the first dire<ab type="infobox"/>ctor of the School of Nisibis and the ‘master’ (<i>rabb</i><i>ān</i>) who is referred to in the second part of both their names. Yoḥannan may have served as an assistant or a co-administrator to Abraham during the latter’s tenure as head of the School. It is noteworthy, however, that <ref type="cr">Barḥadbshabba</ref> the historian, our main source on Abraham, does not mention Yoḥannan’s name at all, while the other Barḥadbshabba, the author of the Cause, emphasizes Yoḥannan’s significance in the School.</p>
<p>Like Abraham, Yoḥannan is credited with biblical commentaries, none of which have survived. He is regularly quoted, however, by later E.-Syr. biblical commentators. In one of his letters (no. 9), Patr. <ref type="cr">Timotheos  I</ref> is probably referring to Yoḥannan’s commentary on Leviticus when he tries to dissuade his correspondent from understanding Yoḥannan’s interpretation of Lev. 18:18 as allowing a Christian to marry his wife’s sister after the death of his wife, a practice which Timotheos strongly opposed.</p>
<p>Outside the field of biblical interpretation, Yoḥan­nan is said to have authored treatises against the Jews, and against the Eutychians (Barḥadbshabba) or the Magi (Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref>), along with discourses, one of which dealt with the Persian emperor Khusrau 
(r. 531–78), either when he gained control over <ref type="cr">Nagran</ref> (572) or at his death. Since, however, Barḥadbshabba situates Yoḥannan’s death during the plague which raged in Northern Mesopotamia in the first half of the 560s, we are left with a chronological problem here, reminding us of how little is known about this intriguing figure.</p>

<p>Commonly known as Yoḥannan Saba (‘Elder’). An 
E.-Syr. monk, author of a Syriac collection of mystical discourses, letters, and maxims (‘chapters of knowledge’). Born in Ardamut, a village northeast of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, in northern Iraq. As a youth he regularly visited the monastery of Mar Aphnimaran to read ascetical literature and to practice fasts and vigils. Eventually he entered the coenobium of Mar Yozadaq in the Qardu mountains (in present-day Turkey). After seven years he adopted the eremitic life in the mountains of Beth Dalyatha (‘house of the vine-branches’), north of Qar­du. In his old age he returned to Qardu, where a group of monks made him their abbot, until his death. His ascetic writings circulated anonymously (by ‘the spiritual elder’) and were translated into Arabic and Ethiopic. Some of his homilies slipped into the Greek collection of <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref> and thence into Latin and other languages of medieval Europe. His writings have survived only in W.-Syr. mss., presumably because his works were banned by <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>, Cath. of the Ch. of E., in 786/7. He prescribed a spiritual path beginning with repentance and ascetic exercises, progressing through purity and serenity, and culminating in perfection. His system was based on guidelines in the Sermon on the Mount: ‘Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect’ (Mt 5:48); ‘Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God’ (Mt 5:8), ‘in their heart’, Yoḥannan mystically adds.</p>

<p>Theologian and theoretician of the spiritual life. His identity has been confused with at least two other persons named Yoḥannan of Apamea: a contemporary writer accused of heresy by <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> (who also called this writer ‘Yoḥannan the Egyptian’); an 
8th-cent. writer condemned under <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> of the Ch. of E. <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar Koni</ref> and <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> reported heretical ideas attributed to Yoḥannan Iḥidaya, but these ideas have yet to be found in extant texts of Yoḥannan Iḥidaya. A number of texts are now available, written during the period 430–50. Yoḥannan Iḥidaya does not give evidence of allegiance to any side in the Christological controversies of that period, though de Halleux and Strothmann believe he had affinities to the miaphysite position. Yoḥannan Iḥidaya’s theological system features two tripartite structures of the spiritual life. First are the orders (<i>ṭakse</i>) of spiritual development: the way of the body (<i>pagrānutā</i>), the way of the soul (<i>napšānutā</i>), the way of the spirit (<i>ruḥānutā</i>) — which bears close resemblance to <ref type="cr">Evagrius</ref>’s system. Second are the levels (<i>mušḥātā</i>) which a person attains: purity (<i>dakyutā</i>), serenity (<i>šapyutā</i>), and perfection (<i>gmirutā</i>). The latter can only be fully attained after the resurrection. Central to Yoḥannan Iḥidaya’s theology is the vision of the New World which will come only after the resurrection of the dead, but which is prefigured for the individual in the sacrament of baptism. Yoḥannan Iḥidaya’s influence on later Syriac writers, both Eastern and Western, is significant, particularly in his conceptualization of the tripartite ‘orders’ of the spiritual life. Probably due to the confusion and controversy over his identity, his works were seldom transmitted under his name. Those now identified by modern scholarship are largely letters and dialogues with several essays on prayer.</p>
<p>Under his name are preserved a Commentary on Qohelet, the authenticity of which is disputed (ed. Strothmann), as well as fragments of a Commentary on Job, which most likely does not belong to him (ed. Van Rompay).</p>

[Ch. of E. and then Chald.] 
<p>Born in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, he became monk and abbot of the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Rabban Hormizd</ref> near <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref>. In 1552, a synod of E.-Syr. bishops elected Yoḥannan Patr. of the Ch. of E. in order to protest against the not canonical, but in this period institutionalized system of hereditary succession, where the dignity of Patr. was mostly passed from uncle to nephew and thus remained within the same family. This synod was not recognized by the legitimate Patr. Shemʿon VII bar Mama and a part of the E.-Syr. bishops. In order to obtain recognition, at the initiative of Latin missionaries, Yoḥannan Sullaqa contacted Roman Catholic authorities and traveled to Rome by way of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>, where his travel companions sent a letter to Pope Julius III requesting him to ordain Yoḥannan Sullaqa as their Catholicos Patr. On the basis of the later oral testimony of Yoḥannan Sullaqa in Rome, the Roman authorities incorrectly assumed that Patr. Shemʿon VII had died in 1551, which paved the way to ordain him a bp. and appoint him as ‘Patr. of Mosul’ (1553). After his ordination Yoḥannan Sullaqa took the name of Shemʿon VIII, returned to the Middle East, and, recognized by the Ottoman authorities, established himself in <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>(Diyarbakır), where he ordained a Metropolitan and several bishops in order to secure his succession as head of the new E.-Syr. Uniate Church. He died in 1555, probably assassinated at the instigation of Shemʿon VII (d. 1558), as appears from a panegyric on Yoḥannan Sullaqa, composed by his successor <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ of Gazarta</ref>.</p>
<p>Yoḥannan Sullaqa is the author of three different professions of faith (1553), originally composed in Syriac. Two of them (of Catholic inspiration) were translated into Latin by <ref type="cr">Andreas Masius</ref>; the third is found in the panegyric of ʿAbdishoʿ and clearly belongs to the Ch. of E.</p>

<p>Following the death of Patr. Yuḥanon IX (1057), Yuḥanon was elected by the Oriental bps. and consecrated in <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>, while simultaneously a different candidate was elected and consecrated with broader support (Athanasios VI Ḥoye). Yuḥanon subsequently stepped down and opted for a quiet life of study and scholarship, thus allowing Athanasios to take office. When five years later, however, Athanasios died, Yuḥanon was urged to come back and was unanimously elected as Athanasios’s successor, serving for nine years, until his death in 1072 (or 1073). Yuḥanon spent most of his life in Amid, rather than in <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>, due to the Byzantine oppression of the Syr. Orth. Our main sources for Yuḥanon’s life are <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> (XV.1; ed. Chabot, 573–5 and 579 [Syr.]; vol.  3, 162–4 and 170–2 [FT]) and <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (Ecclesiastical History, ed. Abbeloos and Lamy, vol. 1, 435–48).</p>
<p>According to Michael Rabo, Yuḥanon was a very prolific writer, who ‘filled the universe with his letters and volumes’ (XV.3: ed. Chabot, 579 [Syr.]; vol. 3, 171 [FT]; cf. Bar ʿEbroyo, vol. 1, 447). He specifically mentions his work on <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> and <ref type="cr">Isḥaq</ref> (of Antioch): Yuḥanon is said to have brought (selections from) their work together in one volume, which he wrote in his old age with his own hands, prevented by death, however, from finishing it. Yuḥanon’s name is in fact associated with Isḥaq’s <i>memre</i> in ms. Vat. Syr. 119 (cf. S. E. and J. S. Assemani, <i>Bibliothecae Apostolicae Vaticanae …</i><i>Catalogus</i>, I.3 [1759], 115–23) and in ms. Berlin 56 (cf. E. Sachau, <i>Verzeichniss der syrischen Handschriften</i>, 188–90). A letter addressed to the Cath. of the Armenians, in which Armenian criticism against the Syr. Orth. is refuted and certain views and practices of the latter are defended, is transmitted as the first part of a larger compilation dealing with the Armenians. It was edited, translated, and studied twice in 1912 by two scholars working independently of one another. There is also an Anaphora transmitted under Yuḥanon’s name. Michael reports that Yuḥanon wrote 4 books (of poetry) on the sack of Melitene (by the Turks in 1058), but these have not been preserved (Chabot 574; vol. 3, 159).</p>
<p>In Arabic a letter to the Coptic Patr. Christodoulos (1047–77), defending the Syr. Orth. practice of mixing salt and oil with the Eucharistic bread, survives. In addition, P. Sbath reports that a treatise on the unity and trinity of God, against the Muslims, exists in one of the mss. of his collection (see Graf).</p>

<p>Aaron bar Maʿdani received the name of Yuḥanon when he became Metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> around the year 1230. In 1231/2 he was ordained <ref type="cr">Maphrian</ref> of the East and appointed Patr. in December 1252. As Patr. he was not recognized by all bishops, some of whom had sworn allegiance to bar Maʿdani’s rival, Dionysios Angur, ordained a few months earlier. Only after the latter’s violent death in 1261 was he accepted as Patr. of the whole Church till his death in 1263 in the monastery of Baksimeṭ (Cilicia).</p>
<p>Bar Maʿdani is a typical representative of the <ref type="cr">Syriac Renaissance</ref>. He studied Arabic in <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref> and, according to<ref type="cr"> Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, he acquired great proficiency in the literary language. He is the author of several Arabic liturgical and moral homilies in rhymed prose. There is some uncertainty whether these are (partly) based on an earlier Syriac original. His collection of Syriac poems deals with different subjects: two poems on the soul, symbolically designated as <i>Poraḥto</i> ‘Bird’, inspired by the imagery and style of Ibn Sīnā’s ‘Recital On the Bird’ and his ‘Ode On the Soul’; on the way of the Perfect; on the invasion of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>; on the ascetic Aaron and several other shorter poems on different themes. The authorship of the latter poems deserves closer examination on account of a certain similarity in style with Bar ʿEbroyo’s poetry and the fact that early compilations contain poems of both Bar Maʿdani and 
Bar ʿEbroyo. Bar Maʿdani also wrote an Anaphora, which was incorporated into later W.-Syr. liturgical compilations.</p>

<p>When Patr. <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref> went to Alexandria in ca. 581 he took with him as theological experts Yuḥanon Barbur and <ref type="cr">Proba</ref>; the two men, however, were won over to the Neo-Chalcedonian position on a technical matter by the sophist Stephanos; while Proba then openly opposed the miaphysite viewpoint, Yuḥanon for a while left his position ambiguous, but finally, as a result of the Plerophoria that he presented at a synod in Gubba Barraya, ca. 585, he was excommunicated. Nothing is known of his subsequent career. Excerpts of some of his writings (including, probably, one from the Plerophoria) are preserved in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,155 (listed by Van Roey, 353–4). He may be the same person as the ‘Abbot Yuḥanon’, author of a short extract in a collection of Chalcedonian christological texts (ed. Bettiolo, CSCO 403–4, [1979], no. XV).</p>

<p>Monk, missionary, church leader, (titular) Bp. of Ephesus, hagiographer, and historian. From the region of <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>, Yuḥanon entered the monastic life as a child. Exiled in the 520s during the Miaphysite persecutions under emperors Justin I and Justinian, Yuḥanon traveled throughout the eastern Roman provinces and Egypt, settling in Constantinople ca. 540 among the displaced Miaphysite community. In 542, Emperor Justinian chose Yuḥanon to lead a missionary campaign in Asia Minor during which Yuḥanon claims to have converted 80,000 pagans and schismatics, and founded 98 churches and 12 monasteries. Consecrated Bp. of Ephesus ca. 558 by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref>, Yuḥanon seems never to have resided in his diocese. Yuḥanon served as archimandrite of a monastery and leader of the Constantinopolitan Miaphysites until his imprisonment under Justin II in the 570s, where he remained until his death. His hagiographical collection ‘Lives of the Eastern Saints’, written in the 560s, and his Ecclesiastical History, written in three parts and covering up through 588, provide some of our most important information about the 6th cent.</p>

(d. 737/8) [Syr. Orth.] 
<p>Monk, stylite, and author. In spite of a reasonable amount of information, several crucial questions concerning Yuḥanon remain without an answer, due to the fact that so little of his work has survived. It is also unclear whether we are dealing with one person or with more persons having similar names.</p>
<p>First, Yuḥanon is known for his exchange of letters with <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> and with <ref type="cr">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>. Seventeen of the letters by Yaʿqub are addressed to Yuḥanon (Van Ginkel, 78–81), while four extant letters of Giwargi have him as the addressee. One letter written by Yuḥanon himself survives in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,154, f. 291r (see Wright, <i>Catalogue</i>, vol. 2, 988b), but remains unedited. It deals with the prophecy contained in the biblical verse Gen. 49:10, and is addressed to the priest Daniel Ṭuʿoyo (i.e., belonging to the Arab tribe of the Ṭuʿoye); its author is named as ‘Yuḥanon Esṭunoyo in the monastery of Litarba (LYTʾRB)’. Yuḥanon clearly belonged to the network of Syr. intellectuals who discussed in their letters a wide range of topics dealing with history, chronology, philosophy, astronomy, literature, and biblical interpretation. Litarba (LYTʾRB or LYTRYB) is commonly identified with Athareb near <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> (see Castellana). Yuḥanon was younger than Yaʿqub and it is generally assumed that he died in 737/8.</p>
<p>Second, Yuḥanon is credited with the authorship of a chronographical work (with a particular interest in chronology), which was used and referred to in the later tradition, esp. in <ref type="cr">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> and <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>. Apart from these references and a limited number of quotations, this work, which probably reached to ca. 726/7, is not preserved.</p>
<p>Third, a short grammatical work was preserved in the E.-Syr. ms. Alqosh (olim) 139 (or 133?; see J. Vosté, <i>Catalogue de la Bibliothèque syro-chaldéenne du Couvent de Notre-Dame des Semences près d’Alqoš</i>[1929], see 108, ms. 293), which Moberg studied on the basis of a copy provided by A. Scher. Its author is introduced as ‘Yuḥanon Esṭunoyo in the Monastery of Mor Zʿuro near Serugh’. Moberg pointed out this work’s dependence on the grammar of Yaʿqub of Edessa (as well as on the Syr. translation of <ref type="cr">Dionysius Thrax</ref>), but was reluctant to identify the author with Yuḥanon of Litarba.</p>
<p>Fourth, ‘Yuḥanon Esṭunoyo of Beth Mor Zʿuro at Serugh’ (echoing the name of the grammarian) is mentioned as the main character in a theological discussion with an opponent (who poses as a non-Christian and may be a Muslim), of which a brief report is preserved in the Maronite ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 202 (ff. 135v–139r). Whether we are dealing here with the correspondent of Yaʿqub of Edessa (as Suermann assumes) is uncertain (see Hoyland, 516–17).</p>

<p>Metropolitan of <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, author, and restorer of churches. He became a monk on the mountain of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, and from there went to Mardin where he was greatly impressed by the buildings of Mor Ḥnonyo Monastery, despite their state of decay. After 1124/5, when he was appointed metropolitan of Mardin and the surrounding region, he was in a position to carry out restorations both there and in local village churches and monasteries (a list is given), and to encourage the revival of the monastic life. He is also said to have written (or sponsored) four illuminated Gospel lectionaries.</p>
<p>A number of biographical (and autobiographical) notices are incorporated into the W.-Syr. ‘Synodicon’, prefacing his Canons for the Monastery of Mor Ḥnonyo (<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>) and some further canons. His liturgical works, on the ‘oil of anointing’ and the myron are preserved in ms. Sharfeh 4/1 (12th cent.; de Vries, 8).

(fl. ca. 685 – ca. 707)
<p>Saint and first patr. of the Syriac Maron. Church of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. Maronite sources situate the election of Yuḥanon and the formation of the patriarchate against the backdrop of the Christological controversies as they related to the See of Antioch. Following the death in 609 of Anastasius II, the last Chalcedonian patriarch to reside in Antioch, titular Chalcedonian patriarchs of Antioch were appointed by Constantinople, a situation which continued until 702. Thereafter, the See remained vacant until 742 when Caliph Hishām allowed the election of Sṭephanos III to take place. During the period of vacancy filled by Sṭephanos, Syriac-speaking Chalcedonians were without a local hierarchy. It was to remedy this situation that the monks of the Monastery of St. <ref type="cr">Maron</ref> elected one of their own as Chalcedonian patriarch of Antioch who took the name ‘Yuḥanon of Maron’.</p>
<p>Maronites refute arguments raised against the historicity of Yuḥanon and the legitimacy of the patriarchate. They cite Rome’s rejection of the election of Macedonius as patr. of Constantinople in 649 as evidence of the fact that, had Yuḥanon’s election been viewed as illegitimate, Rome would have rejected it as well. The question of the legitimacy of Yuḥanon’s election, as well as the charge of Maronite complicity in the monothelete heresy, were further propagated by William of Tyre (d.  1186), who depended exclusively on manipulated passages in the Annals of Eutychius of Alexandria (Saʿīd b. Baṭrīq) as his source of information on the Maronites. In the years following the Muslim Arab conquest of Syria, the region that came to be identified as Dār al-Islām (‘the House of Islam’) was effectively cut off from Constantinople and the West. In support of their perpetual orthodoxy, Maronites cite the consistent recognition of their patriarchate by Rome and their disavowal of monotheletism once they learned of its condemnation at the Council of Constantinople in 680. Maronite sources indicate that Yuḥanon and his successors were canonically constituted and held the title ‘of Antioch’.</p>
<p>Several ecclesiastical works are attributed to Yuḥanon Maron, including an Anaphora, or eucharistic prayer, which bears his name, and a treatise (<i>mimro</i>) on the priesthood. The feast of Yuḥanon Maron is celebrated in the Catholic Church on 2 March .</p>

<p>Ascetic author. Yuḥanon was a W.-Syr. (most likely Syr. Orth.) ascetic on the Holy Mountain near <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. He lived before the 9th cent. and his name Naqar (possibly related to the verb <i>nqar</i>) may be an allusion to the fact that he personally carved out his own monastic cell in the rock. Various popular W.-Syr. monastic anthologies have preserved a number of ascetic fragments dealing with simple themes such as genuflections (<i>burke</i>), the Simple Law (of staying away from the world), seclusion, and voluntary poverty. Two fragments are of a more mystic character and deal with the participation in the Holy Mysteries and with baptism. John was held in high esteem by the Syr.

<p>Bp. of Tella (d-Mawzlat) 519–21. Born 482 in Kallinikos in the province Osrhoene, he received a good education and was fluent in both Syriac and Greek. In 507 he joined the monastic community of Mar Zakkay in Kallinikos and was ordained (among others by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>) bp. of Tella in (Nov.–Dec.?) 519. As Miaphysite bp. he was exiled in 521/2, and lived in hiding around <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref> and in Persia. In exile he ordained thousands of deacons and priests, and thereby established a Miaphysite church hierarchy which became the foundation of the Syr. Orth. Church. In 532/3 he attended a discussion of faith with Chalcedonian bishops in Constantinople.

<Author>S. P. Brock</Author><LemmaTitle>Zacharias, Pseudo-</LemmaTitle> 
<p>A 6th-cent. anonymous Syr. Orth. author, possibly a monk, who compiled a variety of sources into a chronicle in Syriac, including the 6th-cent. Ecclesiastical History of <ref type="cr">Zacharias Rhetor</ref> bp. of Mitylene, who died after 536. Books I–II of Pseudo-Zacharias includes among others the history of Joseph and Aseneth, the Acts of St. Silvester of Rome, and the Legend of the <ref type="cr">Sleepers of Ephesus</ref>. Books III–VI contain the Syriac translation of the Ecclesiastical History by Zacharias Rhetor. The reigns of Anastasius and Justin I are the subjects of Parts VII–VIII, while the reign of Justinian and Justin II up to the year 569 are the subjects of Parts IX–XII. The rest of the Chronicle to Book XII is fragmentary. The importance of this document resides in the fact that it deals with the later 5th and 6th cent., a time of intense christological controversies that divided Christianity into several denominations.</p>

Zacharias bp. of Mytilene (late 5th/early 6th cent.)
<p>Greek author and bp. Zacharias was born in Maiuma, the port of Gaza, in the late 460s; he studied at the School of Gaza and then went on to higher studies in rhetoric and philosophy in Alexandria, where he belonged to a group of zealous Christian students known as <i>philoponoi</i> (‘lovers of labour’). He first met <ref type="cr">Severus</ref> in Alexandria and he later followed him to <ref type="cr">Beirut</ref> to study law. In the early 490s he moved to Constantinople to practice law, and met Severus again during the latter’s time in the capital, 508–11. Details of the later years of his life are very scanty; at some time, perhaps shortly before 536, he became bp. of Mytilene. The date of his death is unknown. Of his various writings (<i>CPG</i> 6995–7001), a few are only known in Syriac translation; the most important of these are his Ecclesiastical History and ‘Life of Severus’. The former covers from the Council of Chalcedon (451) to the end of the reign of Zeno (491), which was incorporated into <ref type="cr">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History as Books 3–6, perhaps in a slightly adapted form. The original Greek was used by Evagrius Scholasticus in his Ecclesiastical History; the Syriac translation is occasionally quoted by <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> in a fuller form than is found in Pseudo-Zacharias. The ‘Life of Severus’ was written to refute a scurrilous pamphlet claiming that Severus had been involved in pagan practices during his student days; it covers up to 512, when Severus became Patr. of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>. Also surviving is the Syriac translation of Zacharias’s Life of the monk Isaiah, and a fragment of a Life of <ref type="cr">Peter the Iberian</ref> (distinct from the Life attributed to <ref type="cr">John Rufus</ref>), ed. Brooks, CSCO 7–8 (1907), 1–16, 18. His two main surviving works in Greek are a philosophical dialogue entitled ‘Ammonios’ (against the Aristotelian notion of the eternity of the world), and 7 ‘Chapters against the Manichaeans’ (ed. with ET, S. Lieu, in<i> JAC</i> 26 [1983], 152–218). In the past some scholars have tried to distinguish between the rhetor, the scholasticus, and the bp., but for their probable identity, see Honigmann.</p>

</LemmaTitle><p>A Syr. Orth. monastery dedicated to Mar Ḥnonyo (Arab. Ḥanānyā) located outside <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>, and the seat of the patriarchate from 1293 until after World War I. The date of its construction is not known, but it may have been originally dedicated to a certain Mar Shlemon and was at some point associated with <ref type="cr">Mar Awgen</ref>. Tradition states that the chapel was built by Ḥanānyā II (793–816), bp. of Mardin and Kfartut, and for this reason it was later known by his name. From the 14th cent. it became popularly known by <i>kurkmo</i> (Arab. <i>Zaʿfarān</i> ‘saffron’), though the reason for this is not known. It was ruined and renovated over ten times, the most prominent of which was the renovation by <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Mardin</ref> (1087/8–1165) that turned it into a monastery appropriate for the seat of the patriarchate. Patr. <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref> was the first to be consecrated there in 1166 and to make it a patriarchal seat, though he did not reside there for most of his tenure, and after sometime it reverted to a bishopric seat. In 1293, Patr. Ignatius b. Wahib (who shared the title with two other patriarchs, Michael in Sīs and Constantine in Malatya) made it his seat, and it remained a patriarchal seat until Patr. <ref type="cr">Eliya III</ref> who was forced to vacate it by the authorities in the aftermath of the <ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref> massacres. Its library (mostly now in the Church of the Forty Martyrs in Mardin) housed 350 mss. at the turn of the 20th cent. Patr. Peṭros III/IV and ʿ<ref type="cr">Abdullāh  II</ref> brought two printing presses in 1881 and 1889 from England, and in 1911 a new set of types were obtained by <ref type="cr">Afram Barsoum</ref> (then a monk at the monastery) who financed the operation himself. Its most prominent bp. in the 20th cent. was <ref type="cr">Dolabani</ref> who organized its library. After Dolabani it remained without a bp. (but still a seat of a diocese) until the consecration of bp. Saliba Özmen in 2003. It is now home to two monks and a few dozen local students and is a formal tourist attraction with thousands of Turkish tourists visiting every year.</p>

<LemmaTitle>Zingerle, Pius (Jacob)</head><ab type="infobox"/>(1801–1881)
<p>Jacob Zingerle was born on 17 March 1801, to a Roman Catholic merchant family in Meran, Southern Tyrol. After completing his high school education, Zingerle studied philosophy and theology at the university of Innsbruck. During this period, Zingerle’s interest in ancient languages was first stimulated, and he began his pursuit of Arabic, Greek, and particularly Syriac. In 1820, while still a university student, Zingerle entered the Benedictine monastery Marienberg at Meran, taking the name ‘Pius’. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1824. Zingerle initially served as assistant priest to a couple of local parishes before being called back to Marienberg in 1830, where he became a teacher at the monastery-run high school.</p>
<p>Zingerle spent most of the next three decades of his life in Meran. He combined his work as instructor and later principal of the school with a busy translation, and publication, schedule that yielded, amongst others, six volumes of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>’s works and several collections of Syriac poetry in translation. In 1861, Pius IX called Zingerle to Rome, installing him as professor of Arabic at the Sapienza. Zingerle also served as <i>scrittore</i> for the Vatican Library, an office that allowed him access to primary sources that would fuel his scholarship for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Health concerns and homesickness brought him back to Marienberg in 1864, where he remained until his death on 10 Jan. 1881. During this final period of his life, Zingerle published, amongst other works, a Syriac chrestomathy and dictionary; he is best remembered for his translations of Ephrem’s and <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>’s 
sermons.</p>

<Author>M. Doerfler</persName></byline></div><div type="entry><head>Zuqnin, Chronicle of</LemmaTitle> 
<p>A universal chronicle which begins with the creation of the world and ends with the year 775/6, the time of composition. It is known from a single ms., partially palimpsest, purchased by <ref type="cr">J. S. Assemani</ref> from <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in Egypt in 1715 and added to the treasures of the Vatican Library under the siglum Codex Zuqninensis Vat. Syr. 162. Separate folios belonging to the last part of the chronicle were acquired in 1842 from the same monastery by H. Tattam, and are now housed in the British Library (Add. 14,665, ff. 2–7). The author’s name is not given; the first folios which may have included it are missing. A likely candidate, however, is <ref type="cr">Yeshuʿ the Stylite</ref> of Zuqnin, whose name is commemorated in a 9th cent. colophon inserted in the chronicle by a Syriac monk residing in Egypt. The work is conveniently divided into four parts reflecting more or less the major literary sources compiled by the author. Part I spans from the creation of the world to the reign of Constantine, and in it the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref> is a major source. Part II goes from the time of Constantine to the time of Theodosius II, on the basis of the Ecclesiastical History of Socrates Scholasticus and such other literary sources as the so-called Chronicle of Yeshuʿ the Stylite. Part III, based among others on the Ecclesiastical History of <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>, covers the reigns of Zeno, Anastasius, Justin I, and Justinian. Part IV, essentially the personal contribution of the chronicler, deals with the reign of Justinian and continues to the year 775. The accounts dealing with the period between 767 and 775 are particularly detailed and altogether they form a unique source on the economic policies of the early Abbasids, namely Caliph Abū Jaʿfar al-Manṣūr, and on the history of the Syr. Orth. Church in the Jazīra in those years.</p>
