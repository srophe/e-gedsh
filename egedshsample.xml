            <p>Teacher of biblical interpretation, author, Cath. (540–52). Born from Zoroastrian
               parents, Aba converted to Christianity and studied at the <ref type="cr">School of
                  Nisibis</ref>. He traveled to the Roman Empire and visited <ref type="cr"
                     >Edessa</ref> (where he was taught Greek, probably by his later disciple <ref
                        type="cr">Toma of Edessa</ref>), Palestine, Egypt, and Constantinople. Upon his
               return, he became a teacher of biblical interpretation (<hi rend="italic"
                  >mpaššqānā</hi>) at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> and subsequently at
               the School of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, which he is said to have
               founded. Following the death of Cath. Pawlos, he was elected as his successor in 540.
               In 544 an itinerant synod was held, during which Aba, accompanied by a changing
               number of bishops, visited several dioceses, many of which still suffered from the
               division in the church that had existed prior to the short tenure of Cath. Pawlos.
               The <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref> has preserved the following documents,
               which are related to this ecclesiastical visitation and, more broadly, to Aba’s
               reforms: 1. on reform of church governance; 2. on the orthodox faith; 3. on the <hi
                  rend="italic">politeia</hi> of correct behavior (focusing on Christian marriage
               and rejecting various kinds of illicit unions); 4. on the deposal of the initiators
               of division and schism; 5. on the various degrees in the ecclesiastical hierarchy; 6.
               a letter entitled <hi rend="italic">Practica</hi> (fragments); 7. canons (1–40;
               incomplete). Aba came into conflict with the Persian authorities and spent several of
               his years as Cath. in prison and in exile.</p>
            <p>The sources attribute to Aba several commentaries on OT and NT books, of which only
               fragments exist in later works, such as the commentaries of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad
                  of Merv</ref>. During his travels, around 530, he served as the instructor in
               biblical matters to the Egyptian author Cosmas Indicopleustes, who ca.  550 wrote his
               ‘Christian Topography’. Cosmas (in Book II.2) acknowledges Aba, whom he calls
               Patrikios (derived from the Greek word for ‘father’), as his source and is aware of
               Aba’s later election as Cath. in Persia. Interested in the Greek originals of <ref
                  type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>’s and <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>’s
               works, Aba may have gathered around him a team of translators. One of these may have
               been the Syriac translator of Nestorius’s ‘Book of Heraclides’, who dedicated his
               work to Aba. A comment in the Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref> led Baumstark
               to suggest that Aba may have authored a Syriac translation of the Greek OT, but this
               cannot be substantiated.</p>
            <p>In addition to a number of Syriac and Arabic sources providing details of Aba’s life,
               there is an important Syriac Life (published by Bedjan), which presents itself as the
               work of one of Aba’s disciples. Two of Aba’s other disciples, <ref type="cr">Qiyore
                  of Edessa</ref> and Toma of Edessa (who died in Constantinople around 543), are
               known through their own writings.</p>
