     <p>Teacher of biblical interpretation, author, Cath. (540–52). Born from Zoroastrian parents,
      Aba converted to Christianity and studied at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>. He
      traveled to the Roman Empire and visited <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (where he was taught
      Greek, probably by his later disciple <ref type="cr">Toma of Edessa</ref>), Palestine, Egypt,
      and Constantinople. Upon his return, he became a teacher of biblical interpretation (<hi
       rend="italic">mpaššqānā</hi>) at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref> and subsequently
      at the School of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, which he is said to have founded.
      Following the death of Cath. Pawlos, he was elected as his successor in 540. In 544 an
      itinerant synod was held, during which Aba, accompanied by a changing number of bishops,
      visited several dioceses, many of which still suffered from the division in the church that
      had existed prior to the short tenure of Cath. Pawlos. The <ref type="cr">Synodicon
       Orientale</ref> has preserved the following documents, which are related to this
      ecclesiastical visitation and, more broadly, to Aba’s reforms: 1. on reform of church
      governance; 2. on the orthodox faith; 3. on the <hi rend="italic">politeia</hi> of correct
      behavior (focusing on Christian marriage and rejecting various kinds of illicit unions); 4. on
      the deposal of the initiators of division and schism; 5. on the various degrees in the
      ecclesiastical hierarchy; 6. a letter entitled <hi rend="italic">Practica</hi> (fragments); 7.
      canons (1–40; incomplete). Aba came into conflict with the Persian authorities and spent
      several of his years as Cath. in prison and in exile.</p>
     <p>The sources attribute to Aba several commentaries on OT and NT books, of which only
      fragments exist in later works, such as the commentaries of <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of
       Merv</ref>. During his travels, around 530, he served as the instructor in biblical matters
      to the Egyptian author Cosmas Indicopleustes, who ca.  550 wrote his ‘Christian Topography’.
      Cosmas (in Book II.2) acknowledges Aba, whom he calls Patrikios (derived from the Greek word
      for ‘father’), as his source and is aware of Aba’s later election as Cath. in Persia.
      Interested in the Greek originals of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>’s and <ref
       type="cr">Nestorius</ref>’s works, Aba may have gathered around him a team of translators.
      One of these may have been the Syriac translator of Nestorius’s ‘Book of Heraclides’, who
      dedicated his work to Aba. A comment in the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Siirt</ref> led
      Baumstark to suggest that Aba may have authored a Syriac translation of the Greek OT, but this
      cannot be substantiated.</p>
     <p>In addition to a number of Syriac and Arabic sources providing details of Aba’s life, there
      is an important Syriac Life (published by Bedjan), which presents itself as the work of one of
      Aba’s disciples. Two of Aba’s other disciples, <ref type="cr">Qiyore of Edessa</ref> and Toma
      of Edessa (who died in Constantinople around 543), are known through their own writings.</p>

     <p>Scholar, Bp. of Kashkar, and Cath. (741–751). Born in (the vicinity of) Kashkar in 641 as
      son of Brik Ṣebyaneh (‘Blessed be His Will’). He received his education in the School of <ref
       type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> and was for a certain time Bp. of Kashkar before his
      election as Cath. in 741. In the sixth year of his Catholicate a conflict between Aba and the
      clergy of Seleucia-Ctesiphon arose; the latter accused the Cath. of having illegally taken the
      possessions of the city’s School. According to a letter written by Aba to the director, the
      teachers, and the other ‘brothers’ of the School, these charges were brought against him while
      he stayed outside the patriarchal seat for some time (probably for reasons of health).
      According to some medieval sources the Cath. retired in a monastery of al-Wāsiṭ for a year,
      but returned to Seleucia-Ctesiphon after the conflict was settled. Aba is known as the author
      of different works which, except for ‘the Letter to the leaders of the School’, are lost: the
      Book of the Governors (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-esṭraṭige</hi>), a Commentary on the
      Theologian (<ref type="cr">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>), a Commentary on some works concerning
      dialectics (probably some books of the ‘Organon’ of <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>), a Homily
      on the Martyr Zakhe, and Exegetical Homilies (<hi rend="italic">Memre puššāqāye</hi>). From
      the latter many fragments and extracts have been preserved in the <ref type="cr">Gannat
       Bussāme</ref>, containing the exegesis of passages from Gen., Num., Isa., and the four
      Gospels. These fragments and extracts are of great importance for the cultural and
      intellectual history of the Ch. of E. for at least three reasons: 1.  they represent the genre
      of exegetical prose homilies in a style which shows a strong influence from and a very
      sophisticated use of Greek rhetoric; 2. they show a very dynamic and varied exegetical
      tradition, in which not only influences from the works of <ref type="cr">Theo­dore of
       Mopsuestia</ref> but also from the works of <ref type="cr">John Chrysostom</ref> and from the
      ancient tradition of the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref> become noticeable; 3. they
      present interesting early examples of apologetic and polemic dispute in response to Islamic
      criticism of Christian tenets such as the Trinity and the Divinity of Christ. Although Aba is
      reported to have maintained as Cath. good relations with the Muslim governor of Iraq, Yūsuf b.
      ʿUmar al-Thaqafī, his homilies testify that he took a fierce polemical stand against the
      anti-Christian proclamations that the Arab authorities propagated in his days.</p>

     <p>Disciple of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, author, and biblical commentator. The ‘Testament of
      Ephrem’ mentions Aba as the first of Ephrem’s seven disciples. He must, therefore, be the same
      person as ‘Mar Aba, the disciple of Ephrem’ to whom several fragments are attributed in ms.
      London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,194, a 9th-cent. W.-Syr. collection of extracts from exegetical
      and theological works. These fragments, published by Nau, are taken from a Commentary on the
      Gospel (3 fragments), a Psalm Commentary (one fragment), and a <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> on
      Job the (OT) athlete (one fragment). To these meager remains some new texts may perhaps be
      added.</p>
     <p>Aba is explicitly quoted in a work on the Holy Chrism by <ref type="cr">Anṭun of
       Tagrit</ref>, which exists in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,726 (f. 72r–85r) and remains
      unpublished.</p>
     <p>In 1975, Beck published a long extract (240 lines of 7 syllables each) from a poem
      attributed to ‘Mar Aba, the disciple of the holy Mar Ephrem’ from ms. Sin. Syr. 67 (9th
      cent.). It deals with God’s immeasurable power and mercy.</p>
     <p>In 1980, Reinink drew attention to forty fragments preserved in the <ref type="cr">Gannat
       Bussāme</ref> and quoted under Ephrem’s name. While other fragments bearing Ephrem’s name in
      the same work can be located in Ephrem’s Commentary on the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref>,
      these forty fragments do not belong to that work. Similarities with the previously identified
      Aba fragments suggest Aba’s authorship. These unpublished fragments show the author’s
      familiarity with the Diatessaron, even though he also knew the four separate Gospels.</p>
     <p>More recently, among the <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> mss. a long ascetic text has
      come to light under the title ‘<hi rend="italic">Memrā</hi> on faith’ (<hi rend="italic"
       >haymānutā</hi>). In two marginal notes the work is identified as ‘Book of the mind’ (<hi
       rend="italic">Ktābā d-reʿyānā</hi>) and is explicitly attributed to ‘Mar Aba, the disciple of
      Mar Ephrem’. Possible connections come to mind with a <hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-reʿyāne</hi>
      (plur.), translated by W.  Wright as ‘Book of sentences’, which is attributed to Ephrem and
      extracts of which exist in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,167, f. 293v. It cannot be ruled
      out that we are dealing here with an example of the entanglement between the literary heritage
      of the master and the disciple. If that is the case, future research hopefully will be able to
      delineate the disciple’s contribution and to bring him out of his master’s shadow.</p>

     <p>Logician, theologian, legal scholar, translator, and metropolitan, first of <ref type="cr"
       >Ḥarran</ref>, and later of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> and Ḥazza. The name ‘Bahrīz’ reveals
      his Persian descent. Ḥabīb was probably his given name and ʿAbdishoʿ his ecclesiastical name.
      Most of our information about ʿAbdishoʿ derives from Muslim sources, most importantly from Ibn
      al-Nadīm, who mentions that he translated many works of logic and philosophy, and that he
      wrote commentaries on classical works for the Abbasid Caliph al-Maʾmūn (d. 833), and made
      summaries of <ref type="cr">Aristotle</ref>’s ‘Categories’ and ‘On Interpretation’. Ibn
      al-Nadīm also makes reference to his works in defense of ‘Nestorian’ Christology, among which
      is a response to two works by a Syr. Orth., in which ʿAbdishoʿ refuted the Syr. Orth. and
      Melk. ­belief in the ‘oneness of hypostasis’ (in Christ), and hence showed that ‘his wisdom
      was close to the wisdom of Islam’. In an anonymous report of a brief Christological discussion
      between ‘ʿAbdishoʿ, the Nestorian Muṭrān, <ref type="cr">Abū Qurra</ref>, the Melkite Bishop,
      and Abū Rāʾiṭa, the Jacobite’ before a Muslim vizier (ed. with ET by Toenies Keating), the
      name of the ‘Nestorian’ has been taken by most modern scholars as a reference to Cath. <ref
       type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (823–28), but it is more likely that this name points to
      ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz, who was also a contemporary of these interlocutors. ʿAbdishoʿ’s
      apologetic work entitled <hi rend="italic">Maqāla fī al-tawḥīd wa-al-tathlīth</hi>, ‘Treatise
      on the Unity and Trinity (of God)’ possibly still survives in mss. in Syria that have remained
      inaccessible so far (see Swanson). Of two works that have been published, one is in Syriac and
      one in Arabic. The former is his legal handbook on marriage and inheritance law (ed. Selb),
      the latter a treatise on logic based on Aristotle’s ‘Categories’ and <ref type="cr"
       >Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Isagoge’ (ed. Dānishpazhūh). This work on logic, <hi rend="italic">Kitāb
       ḥudūd al-manṭiq</hi>, was commissioned by Caliph al-Maʾmūn. ʿAbdishoʿ’s connection with the
      Abbasid elite is further evidenced by the fact that he translated Nicomachus’s ‘Introduction
      to Arithmetic’ from Syriac into Arabic, for the Abbasid general Ṭāhir b. al-Ḥusayn (see
      Freudenthal and Lévy). He also translated works for his friend <ref type="cr">Gabriel bar
       Bokhtisho</ref>ʿ, presumably in the field of medicine.</p>

     <p>Bp. and scholar. ʿAbdishoʿ was bp. of Sinjar and <ref type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>, before
      becoming metropolitan bp. of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> (Ṣoba) and Armenia (ca. 1291). He
      wrote in Syriac and in Arabic. Although in many ways his writings crowned the achievements of
      a highly productive era in E.-Syr. scholarship, many of them do not survive, e.g. a commentary
      on OT and NT, along with other works treating doctrine, canon law, philosophy, and science.
      His surviving works include: <hi rend="italic">Margānitā</hi> ‘The Pearl’, an influential
      systematic explanation of E.-Syr. theology; the <hi rend="italic">Nomocanon</hi>, a
      compilation of synodal decrees containing the most complete collection of E.-Syr. canon law,
      still authoritative in the Ch. of E.; a ‘Treatise on the Rule of Ecclesiastical Judgements’,
      for use as an ecclesiastical court manual; and a collection of theological poetry entitled
      ‘Paradise of Eden’ (also known as the <hi rend="italic">Maqāmāt</hi>). His metrical ‘Catalogue
      of Books’ is an invaluable repository of information about the authors and works of the Syriac
      literary heritage, including many that are no longer extant. Published with a Latin
      translation by J.-S. Assemani in Rome in 1725, the ‘Catalogue’ helped clarify for western
      scholarship the breadth and basic contours of Syriac literature, providing stimulus and some
      direction for the nascent study of Syriac literary history in the West.</p>

     <p>ʿAbdishoʿ bar Yoḥannan d-Beth Maron, monk of the monastery of Mar Aḥa the Egyptian, in the

      (1552) and elected <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref> as Patr. Cath. Recognized by the
      Pope, Yoḥannan ordained ʿAbdishoʿ Metr. of Gazarta. After Yoḥannan Sullaqa’s violent death in
      1555, ʿAbdishoʿ succeeded him as Patr. of the newly established E.-Syr. Uniate (Chaldean)

       al-Zaʿfarān</ref> in 1857, and later taught at <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> for six years
      where he was consecrated a deacon. In 1866, he became the secretary of Patr. Yaʿqub II in <ref
       type="cr">Amid</ref> who, on 19 Feb. 1867, tonsured him, then ordained him to the priesthood
      after two weeks. In 1870, he toured the area of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> and recorded
      the names of villages, monasteries, churches, clergy, and the families living in the area (ed.
      Bcheiry). He was consecrated bp. of Jerusalem on 3 Sept. 1872 by Patr. Peṭros IV and was named
      Gregorius. ʿAbdullāh accompanied the Patr. to England and India from 1874 to 1877. After the
      return of the Patr. from India, ʿAbdullāh stayed for two more years before going back to
      London where he secured a printing press for Dayr al-Zaʿfarān. After his return, ʿAbdullāh
      served as the bp. of Syria from 1880 to 1886.</p>
     <p>ʿAbdullāh paid a second visit to London, during which he attended sessions of the 1888
      Lambeth Conference, and secured a second printing press. In 1890 he became the bp. of Amid. In
      1895 or 1896, the Armenians persuaded ʿAbdullāh to sign a petition which, according to Shahīn,
      ‘went against the wishes of the Ottoman government’. The government issued an order for his
      exile, but ʿAbdullāh took refuge with the French consul where he joined the <ref type="cr"
       >Syriac Catholic Church</ref>. In the Syriac Catholic Synod of 1898 in <ref type="cr"
       >Mardin</ref>, ʿAbdullāh was appointed Syriac Catholic bp. of <ref type="cr">Ḥimṣ</ref> and
      Ḥama, and on 9  Oct. 1898 he participated in the election of Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius
       Ephrem Raḥmani</ref>, and accompanied him in 1902 to Rome, France, and Constantinople. After
      the deposition of the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref type="cr">ʿAbdulmasīḥ  II</ref> on 10 Nov. 1903,
      ʿAbdullāh was elected and then consecrated Syr. Orth. Patr. on 5 Aug. 1906. Shortly after, he
      visited London for the third time <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> to India in 1908–12. In
      London, he met King Edward VII twice. In India, he established the Knaʿanaya diocese. After
      his return from India in 1912, he stayed at the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Mark</ref>
      until his death in 1915 and was buried there. ʿAbdullāh received a medal from King Edward VII,
      and two Ottoman medals from the Ottoman sultan. In 1910 he reopened the seminary at Dayr
      al-Zaʿfarān. He established al-Ḥikma Magazine in 1913. That same year he established for the
      first time a council that consisted of six clergy and six laymen. The council held its first
      session from 20 Feb. until 17 March 1914 but was short lived due to World War I.</p>

     <p>Abgar is named as the author of the martyrdom of Hormizd and his nine companions from <ref
       type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>, who died at the end of Yazdgard’s reign (r.  399–420). P. Devos
      has convincingly shown that three other martyrologies — the martyrdom of Narsai of Beth
      Raziqaye, of Ṭaṭaq of <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref>, and of Yaʿqub the Notary  — must also
      have been written by Abgar. These four martyr texts are grouped together in ms. Berlin, Or.
      oct. 1257 and share similar content and style. The execution of all these martyrs took place
      at Sleq Ḥarobta, not far from <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, and in the proximity of
      a monastery to which in all likelihood Abgar belonged. The ‘cycle of Abgar’, as Devos has

      he describes them in a sober style.</p>

    <head>Abgarids of Edessa</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>Dynasty of kings who ruled in <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> from ca. 133 BC until the middle
      of the 3rd cent. The most common names in this line of kings are Abgar and Maʿnu, both of
      which are of a North Arabian type. The disintegration of the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd cent.
      BC allowed the Abgarids to establish their power. With the appearance of the Romans in the
      Near East in the 1st cent. BC, the Abgarids were able to maintain Edessa and the surrounding
      area of Osrhoene as a more or less independent buffer state between the Roman and the Parthian
      empires. Our main source for the list of ca. 30 Edessene kings is the late 8th-cent.<ref
       type="cr"> Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>. Additional information is occasionally provided by
      other sources, Syriac and non-Syriac, as well as by coins. Of particular interest is the
      E.-Syr. Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (d. 1046).</p>
     <p>Our knowledge of the earliest history is very limited. It becomes more substantial from the
      moment when Rome began to extend its reach into Mesopotamia, i.e., from Abgar VII (109–116) on
      through the end of the dynasty. In the 2nd and early 3rd cent. the relationship between Rome
      and Edessa intensified; it reached its climax under Abgar VIII, the Great (177–212). Rome
      finally imposed its power on Edessa when in 212/13 the short-lived reign of Abgar VIII’s
      successor was ended and the city declared a Roman colonia. The dynasty was briefly restored in
      239, but by 242 Rome had once again taken full control. Whether this was the definitive end or
      whether the dynasty in one form or another continued to exist for some years, as <ref
       type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> seems to suggest in his Chronicle, is unclear.</p>
     <p>It is under the Abgarid kings that the distinctive <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> language
      form that later became known as ‘Syriac’ first started being used in <ref type="cr"
       >inscriptions</ref>. The <ref type="cr">script</ref> of the inscriptions is closely related
      to the <hi rend="italic">Esṭrangela</hi> of the earliest, 5th-cent. Syriac mss. (even though
      some of the mosaic inscriptions exhibit a slightly more cursive type). Mosaics, numismatic
      evidence, and a number of inscriptions, mostly funerary, provide glimpses into Edessa’s social
      and cultural life. In addition to its Aramaic background, these also reveal the impact of
      Roman as well as of Parthian culture. Several of the preserved mosaics can be dated to the
      reign of Abgar VIII or to the period when Edessa was under Roman rule.</p>
     <p>The two kings most closely associated with Syriac Christianity are Abgar V Ukkama (‘the
      Black’, 4  BC–AD 7 and 13–50) and Abgar VIII. The former was alleged to have corresponded with
      Jesus and, at the arrival of the apostle Addai, to have converted to Christianity, along with
      most of the city. This legend is first mentioned in <ref type="cr">Eusebius of
      Caesarea</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History (early 4th cent.) and is further developed in the
      early 5th-cent. <ref type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref>. Some scholars have suggested that the
      historical kernel relates to Abgar VIII and was retrojected into the reign of Abgar V.
      However, the few indications that Abgar VIII might have been a Christian each pose their
      problems. First, the addition in the Book of the Laws of Countries, by <ref type="cr"
       >Bardaiṣan</ref>’s pupil Philippus (ca. 200), that Abgar VIII outlawed the practice of
      self-castration ‘when he came to faith’ (<hi rend="italic">kad haymen</hi>) may very well be a
      later interpolation, as it is lacking from the quotation of the relevant passage in Eusebius
      of Caesarea’s ‘<hi rend="italic">Preparation for the Gospel</hi>’ (VI,10,44). Second, even
      though Sextus Julius Africanus describes Abgar VIII as a ‘holy man’ (as quoted from the
      ‘Kestoi’ in George Synkellos’s ‘<hi rend="italic">Chronography’</hi>), this does not
      necessarily point to the Christian religion. As a matter of fact, the various renderings of
      this term include not only <hi rend="italic">hieros</hi>‘holy’ (<hi rend="italic"
       >Synkellos</hi>), <hi rend="italic">sanctus</hi>‘holy’ (Jerome’s Latin translation of
      Eusebius’s Chronicle), and <hi rend="italic">kāhnāyā</hi> ‘priestly’ (Yaʿqub of Edessa), but
      also terms that do not take on a religious connotation, such as <hi rend="italic">šappirā</hi>
      ‘excellent’ (Chronicle to the year 724) and <hi rend="italic">azniw</hi> ‘noble’ (Armenian
      version of Eusebius’s Chronicle). Also noteworthy is the fact that the coins and the mosaic
      portrait of Abgar VIII (published by Drijvers) do not reveal any Christian symbols or
      ideology. It is very unlikely, therefore, that Abgar VIII — or any other king of the Abgar
      dynasty — ever converted to Christianity. Christianity, however, did exist in Edessa under
      Abgar  VIII. According to Sextus Julius Africanus, the Christian author Bardaiṣan was an
      intimate of the royal court. In addition, a brief comment (seen by some as a later addition)
      in the account of the flood of Edessa in the year 201, as preserved in the 6th-cent. <ref
       type="cr">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, reports that the ‘sanctuary of the church of the
      Christians’ (<hi rend="italic">hayklā d-ʿedtā da-kresṭyāne</hi>) had suffered damage.</p>
     <p>If none of the Edessene kings ever was Christian, it is all the more interesting that the
      Abgarid dynasty, decades after its disappearance, had a Christian afterlife and became an
      important element in the self-definition of Syriac Christians.</p>

     <p>Nicknamed ‘the Lame of Beth Ṣayyade’ after the village in <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref>
      where he was born, he was the disciple of the reformer of ecclesiastical music Babai of Gbilta
      and later became teacher at the School of Bashosh in Persia, founded by Babai, and the School
      of Marga. At the end of his life, he established himself at the <ref type="cr">Monastery of
       Mor Gabriel</ref> near <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, known as the Upper Monastery. According to
       <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>, he was the author of a Book of admonition, a
      Commentary of Marcus Eremita, a Disputation with the Jews, a work on the Royal Path, some <hi

      Syriac lexicography is acknowledged by <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>, who mentions him in
      the introduction to his Syriac-Arabic lexicon. According to <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref>,
      a certain Abraham, who may have been Abraham bar Dashandad, was also active as a copyist of

     <p>Teacher of biblical interpretation and director of the <ref type="cr">School of
       Nisibis</ref>. Our main sources for Abraham’s life are the two works attributed to <ref
       type="cr">Barḥadbshabba</ref> and the Chronicle of<ref type="cr"> Siirt</ref>. The second
      part of Abraham’s name, ‘from the house of our master’ (<hi rend="italic">d-Beth Rabban</hi>),
      is generally understood to refer to <ref type="cr">Narsai</ref>, the first director of the
      School of Nisibis, who may have been Abraham’s relative. Barḥadbshabba the historian presents
      Abraham as Narsai’s immediate successor and in charge of the school for 20 years (502/3 – ca.
      522). According to Barḥadbeshabba, Abra­ham was then temporarily replaced by <ref type="cr"
       >Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye</ref> but he returned to his office a few years later and held it until
      his death, probably in 569. Other sources present Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye as Narsai’s immediate
      successor and put the beginning of Abraham’s tenure ca. 510. For some time during his
      directorship Abraham may have been assisted by his relative <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Beth
       Rabban</ref>. During Abraham’s directorship the School flourished and had its greatest
      expansion, despite Abraham often being the target of attacks both from within and from outside
      the E.-Syr. community.</p>
     <p>Barḥadbshabba the historian credits Abraham with building activities in the School,
      including a hospice (<hi rend="italic">xenodochion</hi>) for the sick and cells and baths for
      the students. As an instructor in biblical interpretation he may have played an important role
      in the transmission of the commentaries of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia.
     </ref>Barḥadbshabba reports that ‘he edited and explained’ (<hi rend="italic">ktab
       w-paššeq</hi>) Theodore’s commentaries, because they were too difficult for the students. In
      this process he is said to have followed ‘the tradition that he had received from his teacher’
      (i.e. Narsai). Unfortunately, none of Abraham’s works have survived. He is, however, often
      quoted in later E.-Syr. commentaries on several OT books.</p>

     <p>Monk, founder and abbot of the ‘Great Monastery’ on Mount Izla. Several biographical
      accounts of Abraham’s life have been preserved, but since their primary goal was to establish
      Abraham’s authority as monastic reformer, their historical information should be used with
      caution.</p>
     <p>Abraham was from the region of Kashkar (later al-Wāsiṭ, in present-day southern Iraq). After
      a period of preaching in <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref>, he is said to have traveled to the
      Egyptian desert of Scetis, to Mount Sinai, and to <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref>. He then
      spent some time at the <ref type="cr">School of Nisibis</ref>, where he studied with <ref
       type="cr">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref> and with <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan of Beth Rabban</ref>,
      before settling, around the middle of the 6th cent., on Mount Izla, in the vicinity of <ref
       type="cr">Nisibis</ref>. He built the ‘Great Monastery’ and assembled many disciples.
      A  monastic rule, consisting of twelve canons, was issued in 570. In the following decades,
      Abraham’s disciples founded monasteries all over Mesopotamia and Persia. Many of the great
      ascetics of the Ch. of E. are associated with Abraham’s monastic movement.</p>
     <p>Monastic life on Mount Izla was of the Egyptian type and consisted of a combination of
      solitary and coenobitic lifestyles. Whether it was modeled on monasticism in Scetis as Abraham
      personally experienced it during his travels, or whether Abraham’s alleged Egyptian
      ‘pilgrimage’ served to legitimate the reform, remains an open question. It also is debated
      whether E.-Syr. Christianity was exposed to Egyptian asceticism only in Abraham’s day or
      whether this already had happened much earlier, perhaps under Mar <ref type="cr">Awgen</ref>,
      the 4th-cent. Egyptian ascetic who was said to have come to Mesopotamia.</p>
     <p>Although asceticism and monasticism must have existed in the Ch. of E. long before Abraham,
      they had been marginalized by the synods of the late 5th  cent. Abraham succeeded in bringing
      them back to the center of the church, where they developed under the control of the
      ecclesiastical and theological authorities. Abraham is said to have introduced a distinct
      tonsure and dress for the monks of his new movement, thus distinguishing them from Syr. Orth.
      monks as well as from dissenters within the Ch. of E. who, continuing perhaps some of the
      earlier patterns of asceticism, were often branded as ‘Messalians’.</p>

     <p>Monastic author. Very little is known about the life of Abraham. ‘Nathpar’ (in some sources,
      ‘Nephtar’, or ‘Nephrath’) appears to be the same as modern Guwair, southeast of <ref type="cr"
       >Mosul</ref> in Iraq, and may designate either Abraham’s birthplace or the site of his
      monastery. Abraham flourished during the period of monastic revival sweeping the Ch. of E. due
      to the reforms of <ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref> at Mount Izla. The ‘Catalogue’ of
       <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>credits Abraham with having written ‘various compositions’,
      mainly on the spiritual life, some of which were translated into Persian. A study of them
      suggests that Abraham tended to adapt older ascetic materials (e.g. <ref type="cr"
       >Aphrahaṭ</ref>) rather than compose his own. Some of the works ascribed to him actually
      derive from other authors (e.g. <ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref> and <ref type="cr"
       >Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>). In the mid-7th cent., Sabrishoʿ Rustam, while head of the monastery

     <ab>(ca. 420)</ab>
   </div>
    <div type="body">
     <p>Syriac writing containing the legendary correspondence between Jesus and King Abgar of <ref
       type="cr">Edessa</ref>, the report of the apostle Addai’s mission to Edessa and of the city’s
      christianization, and the story of the finding of the Cross by Protonike, the wife of emperor
      Claudius. Towards the end, the text claims to have been written by Labubna, the king’s scribe,
      and to have been deposited in the royal archives at Edessa.</p>
     <p>An earlier and shorter version of part of this story exists in the first book (I,13) of the
      Greek Ecclesiastical History of <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref> (written in the late
      3rd and early 4th cent.), who mentions a Syriac document from the archives of Edessa as his
      source. In Eusebius’s text Addai is known by the name Thaddaios (Thaddeus), and some of the
      details of the later story, such as the portrait of Jesus, are missing. Eusebius’s account
      ends after Abgar is healed and Thaddaios is asked to speak to the people of Edessa, a prelude
      to the city’s conversion. The Ecclesiastical History was translated into Syriac around 400.
      The exact relationship between Eusebius’s text and the early 5th-cent. <hi rend="italic"
       >Teaching</hi> remains somewhat unclear, and several expansions of the <hi rend="italic"
       >Teaching</hi> obviously belong to the 4th and 5th cent.</p>
     <p>Eusebius’s claim of a written source appears plausible, which implies that the kernel of the
      story was composed, at the latest, towards the end of the 3rd cent. What is remarkable,
      however, is the paucity of outside corroboration for this story. In the approximately 100
      years between Eusebius’s work and the Teaching, no mention is made of this story in Syriac
      sources. The complete silence of <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, who spent the last ten years of
      his life in Edessa, as well as of the <ref type="cr">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, a
      mid-6th-cent. composition that includes important information on 4th-cent. Edessa, is
      particularly striking. The earliest affirmation of the story is by Egeria, who mentions it in
      her Latin travelogue (383–84). It is only after the <hi rend="italic">Teaching</hi>begins to
      circulate that Syriac sources begin to reference the story.</p>
     <p>The origins of the story are difficult to discern. The most plausible theory takes into
      account the heterogeneous nature of the earliest Christianity in Edessa. In the 2nd and 3rd
      cent. Edessa was home to many competing groups, as the followers of <ref type="cr"
       >Marcion</ref>, <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>, <ref type="cr">Mani</ref>, a ‘proto-orthodox’
      group, and others all vied for authority. The story most likely originated inside one of these
      groups fighting for both supremacy and authenticity. Whatever is the case, the group that
      later became dominant and represented orthodox Christianity perpetuated the story in order to
      substantiate its claim as the true faith.</p>
     <p>The story’s popularity reveals its importance for later Syriac Christianity. Accordingly,
      Syriac Christianity could trace its roots all the way back to the apostles and to Jesus
      himself. Also significant is the connection that the story establishes between Edessa, <ref
       type="cr">Antioch</ref>, and Rome, thus linking the nascent Edessene church to Christianity
      in the Roman Empire.</p>
     <p>An interesting subplot surrounds the portrait of Christ in the <hi rend="italic"
       >Teaching</hi>. While this portrait does not occur in Eusebius, and is only briefly mentioned
      in the <hi rend="italic">Teaching</hi> as a portrait painted by Ḥannan, the tabularius, it
      later became famous in Byzantine Christianity. From the late 6th cent. onwards, the portrait
      was said to have been ‘made not by human hands’. In 944, the portrait was taken to
      Constantinople and became an icon of great importance. There is no trace of it after the sack
      of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204.</p>
     <p>The full Syriac text of the Teaching is preserved in one early ms., which was written
      probably in Edessa around 500 (nowadays in the library of St. Petersburg), while extracts
      exist in a few other mss. In the 5th cent., the Syriac text was translated into Armenian; in
      the ensuing centuries the legend became fully part of Armenian historiography. There are also
      translations into Arabic. From Arabic it found its way into Ethiopic, where it enjoyed great
      popularity.</p>

    <head>Adiabene</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>Classical Adiabene, Syriac <hi rend="italic">Ḥadyāb</hi>, refers to the region between the
      Upper and Lower Zab rivers, from the Tigris in the west to Mt. Ṣalāḥ al-dīn (= Mt. Pirmum) in
      the east. Its main city was the ancient Assyrian Arbaʾil (modern Arbīl), seat of Ishtar of
       <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref>, goddess of war and collaborator in the creation of humans.
      Ḥazzā, the name referring to Adiabene in Arabic sources, was an earlier center of the region,
      located some 12 km. southeast of Arbīl. The impressive citadel of Arbela contains remains from
      the Neolithic period to modern times, including Sasanian, Christian, and Islamic levels in
      between. Arbaʾil was a caravan city on a trade route linking southern Mesopotamia and Persia
      with Palestine and Egypt, as shown in an Aramaic letter signed by Arshama, the Achaemenid
      satrap of Egypt (late 5th cent. BC). During the 1st cent. AD the local royal family converted
      to Judaism, under Izates, who enjoyed quite a remarkable reign according to <ref type="cr"
       >Josephus</ref> (‘Antiquities’,<hi rend="italic"></hi>20.17–94). Christianity spread into
      this region quite quickly, with Papa possibly serving as its first metropolitan as of 310. The
      Synod of 410 held in <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> declared Adiabene a metropolitan
      seat, occupied in that year by Daniel. Thereafter, Adiabene grew into a great administrative
      province of the Ch. of E., though it suffered several persecutions, especially under
      Shapur  II (309–379). The jurisdiction of the metropolitan of Adiabene was not restricted to
      his own province but extended at one point to include Azerbaijan and <ref type="cr"
       >Nineveh</ref>, divided into nine suffragan dioceses. When <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> grew in
      political and economic importance at the beginning of the 9th cent., it separated from
      Adiabene, but the latter continued to be a Metropolitan see until the beginning of the 17th
      cent. By the end of the 18th cent. most of Adiabene joined the Catholic uniate movement, and
      Arbela fell under the jurisdiction of the Chaldean archbishop of Kirkuk.</p>

     <p>Greek author of animal fables which came to enjoy a very wide popularity in numerous forms
      and languages. Three related Syriac collections survive, a standard collection with 64 fables,
      in a number of mss., but a larger one in a single ms. with 83 fables, and a third collection
      with only 10; Aesop’s name was corrupted into ‘Iosipos’ and identified as <ref type="cr"
       >Josephus</ref>in the ‘Catalogue’ of <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>. The Syriac translation
      has been variously dated between the 9th and 11th cent. It subsequently came to circulate in
      Jewish circles in Hebrew characters (attributed to ‘Sophos’), and in the 11th cent. a Greek
      translation was made by Michael Andreopoulos in <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>; in this the
      author’s name came to be given as Syntipas (the Syriac <ref type="cr">Sindbad</ref> having

    <head>Aḥiqar</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>Aḥiqar, ‘the Aramean Sage’ who is mentioned in an Akkadian text, is the hero of a narrative
      set in the Assyrian Court: as the Minister of Sennacherib (705–681 BC) and Esarhaddon (680–69
      BC), he instructs his nephew Nadan by means of wise sayings, so that in due course he might
      succeed him; Nadan, however, is impatient and plots to have the Assyrian king put Aḥiqar to
      death, but a friend hides the Sage and only reveals that he is still alive when the Assyrian
      king is put to a challenge by the Egyptian Pharaoh. Aḥiqar is produced and solves the riddling
      challenge; he then proceeds to give Nadan a second set of instructions, this time admonitory
      in character.</p>
     <p>A collection of sayings by Aḥiqar, and a narrative concerning him, is already known in
      Imperial <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> in fragmentary form from a papyrus from Elephantine
      (south Egypt) dated to the 5th cent. BC (the recent identification of the erased under-text as
      a customs document concerning shipping cargos, dated 475 BC, provides a <hi rend="italic"
       >terminus post quem</hi>); here the king is Esarhaddon. Very probably the sayings and the
      narrative once circulated independently in slightly different dialects, but in their combined
      form they have proved very influential over the course of time in many different languages,
      and they have continued to be read up to the present day. In the Hellenistic period Aḥiqar is
      mentioned by name in the book of Tobit (1:21–2; 2:10; 11:19; 14:10, 15), and traces of the
      work have been found in Egyptian Demotic. It must also have been translated into Greek, since
      ‘Akikharos’ is mentioned by several Greek authors, and much of the narrative has been reused
      in the Greek Life of <ref type="cr">Aesop</ref> (probably 1st cent.); furthermore, a lost
      Greek translation must lie behind the subsequent translations into Old Slavonic and Romanian.</p>
     <p>Five recensions of the Syriac form of the Story are preserved, and these evidently go back
      to a lost older Syriac text which will have been the basis for the Armenian version (which in
      turn was the source for the Georgian and Old Turkish translations), and for the Arabic
      adaptations (sometimes under the name of Luqman). The Ethiopic translation derives from
      Arabic, and the Modern Syriac versions, though based on Classical Syriac, also show some
      influence from Arabic forms of the Story.</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Exegete from <ref type="cr">Beth Qaṭraye</ref> mentioned by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar
       Brikha</ref>. According to Assemani he lived around 990. Cowley suggests identifying this
      Aḥob with Ayyub, ‘the interpreter of Seleucia’, who lived at the end of the 6th cent. His main
      argument is that <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> (9th  cent.) has quoted Aḥob. In all
      likelihood Christianity had already disappeared from the Beth Qaṭraye region by the beginning
      of the 10th  cent.; therefore, it would indeed seem wise not to date him much later than other
      important scholars from Beth Qaṭraye such as <ref type="cr">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>, <ref
       type="cr">Dadishoʿ</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref>. Assuming that Cowley is
      right, Aḥob was born in Qaṭar and must have migrated to <ref type="cr">Seleucia</ref>. The
      Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref> states that he was considered for election as Cath. in
      581, when <ref type="cr">Isho</ref>ʿ<ref type="cr">yahb</ref> was chosen.</p>
     <p>ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha’s ‘Catalogue’ credits Aḥob with an ‘Elucidation of the whole New
      (Testament), of the Pentateuch and all the Prophets, in addition to (or: except for) an
      elucidation of the Beth Mawtbe (i.e. Josh., Judges, 1–2 Sam., 1–2 Kings, Ruth, and wisdom
      books)’. These works have not been handed down to us: the New Testament commentary Baumstark
      suggested to attribute to Aḥob is lost (ms. Siirt 27). We do have quotations in later authors,
      however.</p>
     <p>The Genesis part of the Anonymous Commentary on the Pentateuch (9th/10th cent.) contains two
      references to Aḥob, according to some of the manuscripts. Especially important are the
      quotations in the Commentary on Psalms ascribed to <ref type="cr">Denḥa</ref> (9th  cent.?),
      partly in the margins and partly in the text itself. Some of these present the exegesis of
       <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. The parallels between Aḥob and Ishoʿdad of Merv
      can be explained by assuming that Ishoʿdad used Aḥob, but not the other way round. Aḥob was an
      important source for Ishoʿdad’s alternative readings of the biblical text, especially the
      readings attributed to ‘the Hebrew’. The 19th-cent. mss. (ms. Mingana Syr. 58 and ms.
      Cambridge Or. 1318, among others) containing the Denḥa commentary also include a Book on the
      cause of the Psalms of Mar Aḥob Qaṭraya. Mingana and Vosté’s attribution to him of yet another
      treatise, a classification of the Psalms, is probably incorrect, however.</p>
     <p>Fragments of Aḥob were also quoted by <ref type="cr">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043) in his
      biblical commentaries in Arabic, whence they found their way to Ethiopia, where they were
      first translated into Ethiopic and later received a place in the Amharic Andemta commentary
      tradition. Further references to Aḥob can be found in <ref type="cr">Bar Bahlul</ref>’s
      Lexicon and in <ref type="cr">Isḥaq Shbadnaya</ref>’s prose commentary on his own Poem on the
      Divine Government of the World from the Creation to the Consummation (15th cent.).</p>

      different works ‘On the composition of man’ are attributed to Aḥudemmeh. The first (ed. Nau)

      second (ed. Chabot) is found in an E.-Syr. ms. of 1904, and is attributed to ‘Aḥudemmeh
      Antipatros’; according to Chabot this is not by Aḥudemmeh but a work by the 2nd-cent. doctor
      Antipater, not preserved elsewhere. The ms. of 1904 continues with a short anonymous text on
      man as a microcosm, which could be by Aḥudemmeh (so Gignoux, who also considers the previous
      text to be by the 6th-cent. Aḥudemmeh; he also draws some parallels with Middle Persian

     <ab>Theseus Ambrosius (1469 – ca. 1540)</ab>
   </div>
    <div type="body">
     <p>Italian humanist, belonging to the earliest generation of Syriac scholars. He became Doctor
      of Canon and Civil Law in Pavia, his native city. After receiving the Holy Orders and joining
      the <hi rend="italic">Canons Regular of Saint Augustine, Albonesi went to Rome, where Cardinal
       Bernardino López Carvajal, on behalf of Pope Leo X, commissioned him to examine the Syriac
       version of the Maronite missal. Thus Albonesi made the acquaintance of the three delegates of
       the Maronite patriarch to the Fifth Lateran Council (1512–17): the priest Joseph Kūri
       (Acurius), the deacon Moses, and the subdeacon Elias bar Abraham (from whose hand came the
       first Syriac mss. to enter the Vatican Library). At that time Albonesi knew no Syriac, but he
       had studied Hebrew in Rome with some Jewish scholars, among whom were Joseph Zarfati, Abraham
       of Balmes, and a certain</hi>ʿ<hi rend="italic">Abdias (perhaps</hi>ʿO<hi rend="italic"
       >badiah Sforno, Reuchlin’s teacher). Zarfati, who, like the Lebanese envoys, spoke Arabic,
       served as an interpreter, allowing the translation of the Syriac missal into Latin via Arabic
       and Italian (the product of this enterprise is found in codex Estensis</hi>α.R.7.20 in
       Modena).<hi rend="italic"> Albonesi returned to his hometown with the knowledge of Syriac
       that he had gained by studying under Elias’s guidance and with a ms. of the Syriac Psalter
       that he intended to publish. Both the ms. and the types he had produced were, however,
       destroyed during the sack of Pavia on the part of the French army of François I (1527). The
       unexpected finding of his lost ms. among the wrapping paper of a sausage-maker in Ferrara
       reportedly prompted Albonesi to rebuild his typography and to devote himself to the
       preparation of that which he meant to be an introduction to the edition of the Syriac
       Psalter. The book, entitled Introductio in Chaldaicam linguam, Syriacam atque Armenicam,
       &amp; decem alias linguas…</hi> (‘Introduction to Chaldean, Syriac, Armenian, and ten other
      languages…’, Pavia, 1539), was finally printed by<hi rend="italic"> Giovanni Maria Simonetta.
       The previous year Guillaume Postel had already xylographically reproduced, in his Duodecim
       characteribus differentium alphabetum…</hi>(Paris, 1538), two brief Syriac texts. Albonesi’s
       <hi rend="italic">Introductio</hi>, however, despite some graphic inaccuracies, presented for
      the first time in Europe a substantial amount of information about the Syriac language, as
      well as Syriac texts of some length. Albonesi was also instrumental in igniting Johann <hi
       rend="italic">Albrecht Widmanstetter’s interest in Syriac. Widmanstetter, whom</hi>Albonesi
       <hi rend="italic">met in Reggio Emilia in 1529, would eventually publish, along with
      </hi><ref type="cr">Mushe of Mardin</ref><hi rend="italic">, the first edition of the NT

    <head>Aleppo</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>City in northern Syria and an important center of Christianity in the Middle East today as
      the seat of a total of nine bishoprics (Syr. Orth., Syr. Catholic, Chald., Maron., Melk.
      Orth., Melk. Catholic, Armenian Orth., Armenian Catholic, Latin). Aleppo, nicknamed ‘Grey
      Aleppo’ (<hi rend="italic">Ḥalab al-šahbāʾ</hi>) in Arabic, owes its military and commercial
      importance to its imposing citadel and its favorable position on the trade route linking the
      nearby Mediterranean coast with Mesopotamia and areas beyond. Aleppo’s history goes back at
      least to the second millenium BC. The earliest known names of Aleppo are cognates of the
      modern name ‘Ḥalab’, but Seleucus Nicator (d.  281  BC) who founded a Greek colony here named
      it after ‘Beroea’ in Macedonia, and it is by that name that Aleppo is normally known in older
      Syriac literature. Aleppo came under Roman rule in 64 BC. After the Arab conquest in 636,
      Aleppo first rose to prominence under the Ḥamdānid Sayf al-Dawla (945–67). Aleppo later became
      the seat of lines of Zangids (1129–83) and Ayyūbids (1183–1260). Aleppo was taken by the
      Mongols in 1260 and a little later by the Mamlukes. Under the Ottomans (1516–1918), Aleppo
      became the capital of a province covering much of today’s northern Syria and a significant
      part of Turkey (including <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, Alexandretta/Iskenderun, and
      ʿAintab/Gaziantep). For much of that period, it was the third largest city in the Ottoman
      Empire after Istanbul and Cairo, and the Christians, including Syr. Christians, as well as a
      larger number of Melkites and later an increasing number of Armenians, then played an
      important role in the life of the city, one noteworthy member of the Aleppine Syr. Catholic
      community from the period being the world-famous chess player Philip Stamma (ca. 1705–55).
      Aleppo is today the largest city in Syria with a population of ca. 1.7 million (2.85 million
      in the larger conurbation, in 2008).</p>
     <p>The first known bp. of Aleppo is Eustathius, who became Patr. of Antioch and attended the
      Council of Nicaea in that capacity. Bp. Peter of Aleppo was a supporter of <ref type="cr"
       >Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> at the Synod of Sidon in 511, while Bp. Antoninus was among the
      Miaphysite bishops exiled with <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> under Emperor Justin.</p>
     <p>The first known Syr. Orth. bp. after the reorganization of the church in the mid-6th cent.
      is Matthew (644–669). Among his successors was <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (ca. 1253–64),
      who was the bp. there when the city fell to the Mongols in 1260. Little is known about the
      Syr. Orth. community in the subsequent period until the beginning of the 16th cent., when we
      first hear of a Syr. Orth. (later Syr. Catholic) church of the Mother of God in the Christian
      quarter of Judayda (Jdeideh), and we find Aleppo included, along with <ref type="cr"
       >Damascus</ref> and Ḥama, in the title of Metr. <ref type="cr">Grigorios Yawseph the
       Iberian</ref> of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> (metr. 1515–37). From the second half of the
      16th cent. onwards, we frequently hear of visits to Aleppo by Syr. Orth. patriarchs, including
      Ignatius Pilatus I (Patr. 1591–97) who died and was buried in Aleppo. The Syr. Orth. community
      in Aleppo, reduced to a small number through large-scale conversions to the Syr. Catholic
      Church since the latter half of the 18th cent., was reinforced in the 20th cent. by refugees
      fleeing the atrocities in areas now in the Republic of Turkey. These refugees included a group
      from <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, who migrated to Aleppo en masse in 1924, as well as those
      from the area around <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>.</p>
     <p>As a center of Latin missionary activity since the beginning of the Ottoman era, with
      Capuchins, Jesuits and Carmelites present in the city by 1526, Aleppo played an important role
      in the formation of the <ref type="cr">Syriac Catholic Church</ref>. Andrew Akhījān (Patr.
      1662–78) worked and was elected Patr. in Aleppo, while Michael Jarweh (Patr. 1782–1800) was
      born in Aleppo and was Metr. of Aleppo prior to his elevation to the patriarchate. The central
      role Aleppo continued to play in the life of the Syr. Cath. Church is reflected in the fact
      that five out of the thirteen successors of Michael Jarweh have been natives of Aleppo
      (Michael Ḍāhir, Peter Jarweh, George Chelhot, Antony Ḥayek, Peter ʿAbd al-Aḥad), while two
      others were Metr. of Aleppo before ascending to the patriarchate (<ref type="cr">Ignatius
       Ephrem Raḥmani</ref>, <ref type="cr">Gabriel Tappuni</ref>).</p>
     <p>The E.-Syr. see of Aleppo is attested in the 11th cent. and is also mentioned as a suffragan
      of Damascus in a list of bishoprics appended, in a 13th-cent. ms., to the canonical works of
      Elias of Damascus (ca. 900), but it was probably extinct by the 13th cent. Nothing is then
      heard of the E.-Syr. presence in Aleppo until the 17th cent. The Chald. diocese of Aleppo,
      founded as a patriarchal vicariate in 1901 and raised to the status of an eparchy in 1957,
      today covers the whole of Syria.</p>
     <p>The presence of an early Maronite community in Aleppo in 727 is recorded in the Chronicle of
       <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>. Significant presence of Maronites in the modern period
      dates from the 17th cent., with Maronite bishops regularly resident in the city since 1686.
      Aleppo played an important role in the life of the Maronite Church as one of her few urban
      centers, and the Maronite school there produced such men as the three founders of the Maronite
      Aleppine Order (later Mariamites) and the scholar-bishop Germanus Farḥāt (bp. of Aleppo
      1725–32). The Maronite woman mystic Hindiyya al-ʿUjaymī was born in Aleppo in 1720.</p>
     <p>In the first decade of the 20th cent., there were reported to be approximately 35,000–40,000
      Christians in the city, making up about one third of the total population and including: 3,500
      Syr. Catholics (4,000 in the diocese), 50 Syr. Orth. (500 in the diocese), 250 Chald. and
      3,600 Maron. (Karalevsky); as well as 1,200 Melk. Orth., 10,000 Melk. Catholics, 15,000
      Armenian Orth., 5,500–7,000 Armenian Catholics, 1,100 Latins and 1,500 Protestants
      (Tournebize). The numbers reported today for the Syriac dioceses of Aleppo are: Syr. Orth.
      15,000 (in 2003, Zinda Magazine); Syr. Catholic 8,000 (in 2006, <hi rend="italic">Annuario
       pontificio</hi>); Chald. 15,000 (in 2006, <hi rend="italic">Annuario pontificio</hi>, for
      whole of Syria); Maron. 4,000 (in 2006, <hi rend="italic">Annuario pontificio</hi>). The
      actual numbers (esp. for the Chaldeans) will have been increased significantly by those
      fleeing insecurity in Iraq since 2003.</p>
     <p>Little is known about the sites of the medieval Syriac churches in Aleppo. The churches
      dating from the Ottoman period are found in the traditional Christian quarter in Judayda just
      north of the medieval city. These include the Melkite and Armenian churches concentrated in
      the Ṣalībat al-Judayda Quarter, as well as the Syr. Catholic Church of Mār Āsyā al-Ḥakīm
      (formerly Mother of God) a little to the east, and the Maronite Cathedral of Mar Eliya to the
      north. A  number of newer churches, including the Syr. Catholic Cathedral (Umm
      al-Intiqāl/Assumption, 1970), are found in the ʿAzīziyya District to the north of Judayda. The
      Chaldean Cathedral and the Syr. Orth. Cathedral of Mar Ephrem lie further north in
      Sulaymāniyya. Further churches belonging to the Syriac communities are found in the ‘Old
      Syriac Quarter’ (Ḥayy al-Suryān al-Qadīm) just behind the railway station to the northwest of
      the city center, a quarter established by migrants from Edessa (Mār Jirjis, Syr. Orth.; Mār
      Afrām, Syr. Catholic), and in the ‘New Syriac Quarter’ (Ḥayy al-Suryān al-Jadīd) further
      northwest (Sayyidat al-Suryān ‘Our Lady of the Syriacs’, Syr. Orth.).</p>
     <p>Important collections of Christian Arabic and Syriac mss. are found in Aleppo at the Maron.
      Archiepiscopal Residence (over 1640 mss.), Fondation Georges et Mathilde Salem (most of Sbath
      Collection, no. 777–1321, and some additional mss.), Syr. Catholic Archiepiscopal Residence
      (ca. 500 mss.) and Syr. Orth. Archiepiscopal Residence and Church of Mar Jirjis (including the
      collection transferred from Edessa, ca. 225 mss.), as well as at the Melk. Catholic
      Archiepiscopal Residence (ca. 1,100 mss.).</p>
     <p>A large number of ruined Byzantine churches are found in the so-called ‘Dead Cities’ in the
      hills to the west of Aleppo, including the ruins of the huge basilica built around <ref
       type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>’s pillar at Qalʿāt Simʿān (approx. 30 km. west-northwest
      of Aleppo).</p>

    <head>Alexander Cycle</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>The exploits of Alexander the Great (356–23 BC) gave rise to a very large number of works,
      in many different languages. The three main works concerning him in Syriac are:</p>
     <p>1. A translation of Pseudo-Callisthenes, (based on the Greek recension <hi rend="italic"
       >delta</hi>), preserved in a number of late E.-Syr. mss. (ed. with ET by Budge). According to
      Nöldeke, this was not translated directly from Greek, but by way of a lost Middle Persian
      version; this view has, however, been recently challenged by Ciancaglini, who points to strong
      evidence that it was made directly from Greek. The Syriac version includes a visit by
      Alexander to <ref type="cr">China</ref>, which is an episode absent from all other texts.
      There is also a Modern Syriac version.</p>
     <p>2. A narrative poem on Alexander attributed to <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, but
      dating almost certainly from soon after the emperor Heraclius’s victory over the Persians
      (629/30). The different recensions are edited by Reinink (ET in Budge, 163–200).</p>
     <p>3. A christianized legend of Alexander entitled ‘The exploits of Alexander’. This is found
      in the mss. of the Syriac version of Pseudo-Callisthenes (and is included in Budge’s edition)
      and, in a somewhat different, but related, form, in the <ref type="cr">Zuqnin Chronicle</ref>.
      This too is thought to date from shortly after 629/30. According to van Bladel (2008), this
      provided the source for the section on Alexander in the Qurʾān.</p>
     <p>Other Syriac texts relating to Alexander are:</p>
     <p>4. A short life, preserved in a single ms. of the 8th/9th cent. (ET in Budge, 159–61).</p>
     <p>5. Sayings attributed to Alexander, preserved in various sources, including <ref type="cr"
       >Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s Amusing Stories.</p>
     <p>6. A set of short laments over Alexander, said to have been uttered by various philosophers.
      These are also found in Arabic, in the Annals of Eutychius (ca. 935).</p>
     <p>7. An account of Alexander’s encounter with the Brahmin Dandamis (an excerpt from <ref
       type="cr">Palladius</ref>’s ‘On the Peoples of India and on the Brahmins’).</p>
     <p>8. Various notices in Chronicles.</p>
     <p>9. Ms. Vat. Syr. 555 (W.-Syr., dated 1501) contains an astronomical ‘Book of Alexander’.

     <p>Town 40 km. north of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> in Iraq. Seat of a Chald. bishopric. It now
      numbers around 5,000 inhabitants. Many families and individuals migrated from Alqosh to larger
      Iraqi cities (Mosul, <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>, etc.) or abroad, especially to the USA and
      UK. The town’s economy is based on agriculture (wheat, barley, chickpeas, lentils, beans,
      cucumbers, gourds, melons, grapes, and figs) and animal husbandry (sheep and goats).
      Traditional trades included weaving and dying cloth. Alqosh is a major spiritual center. Jews
      used to go on pilgrimage to the tomb believed to be that of the prophet Nahum, who, according
      to an interpretation of Nah 1.1, may have come from Alqosh. Two important E.-Syr. monasteries
      lie close to Alqosh: the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Rabban Hormizd</ref>, founded in the
      7th   cent., used to be one of the patriarchal residences of the Ch. of E., later moved to
      Mosul, then Baghdad, and the more recent Monastery of the Virgin, also known as ‘the Lower
      Monastery’ or ‘of Our Lady of the Seeds’. From the 16th cent. the cultural life of the village
      flourished thanks to the so-called <ref type="cr">School of Alqosh</ref>. Alqosh was pillaged
      several times, by Murād Bey (Bar Yak) in 1508, the Pasha of ʿAmadiyya in 1740, the Persians in
      1743. People sought refuge on the mountain, in the Monastery of Rabban Hormizd, but there were
      rapes and casualties. Around the mid-16th cent. some of the population supported <ref
       type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref>, the first Chald. Patr. elected with official approval of
      Rome. In 1767, around 100 of the 500 families were Catholic. Literary sources and annotations
      made by European travelers record recurrent cases of pestilence and famine, caused by draught
      or locusts, which devastated the region during the 19th cent. In 1832 and 1842 the village was
      attacked and pillaged by Kurds.</p>

   </div>
    <div type="body">
     <p>City in upper Mesopotamia. Situated on high ground on the right bank of the Tigris and
      surrounded by massive black basalt walls, which later gave it the nickname ‘Black (<hi
       rend="italic">kara</hi>) Amid’, Amid was by the 4th cent. a key point in Rome’s defence of
      her eastern frontiers and became the most important city in the Roman province of Mesopotamia
      after the cession of <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> to the Persians in 363. It was taken by the
      Persians in 359, 503, and 606/7. After the Arab conquest in 639, it was ruled by a series of
      dynasties including the Kurdish Marwānids (984–1085), and the Turkmen Īnālids (1097–1183),
      Ḥisn Kayfā Artuqids (1183–1230) and Aq Qoyunlu (1401–1507), dynasties which at one point or
      another made Amid their chief seat. After being taken by the Ottomans in 1515, Amid became the
      administrative center of a province that covered most of northern Mesopotamia from Manzikert
      in the north to Sinjar in the south. It is today a provincial capital and the largest city in
      the Turkish part of Mesopotamia with a population of over half a million. The name Diyarbakır
      (Arabic <hi rend="italic">Diyār Bakr</hi>), which originally referred to the region around
      Amid, came to be used for the city in Ottoman times and was officially adopted in 1937,
      replacing the older name which goes back to Assyrian ‘Amedi’.</p>
     <p>Amid was evangelised at an early date, no doubt from <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. The first
      known bp. of Amid, Simeon, is said in a late source to have attended the Council of <ref
       type="cr">Nicaea</ref>. His successors include Acacius, celebrated for his ransoming of Roman
      soldiers taken captive by the Persians in 423/4, as well as Asterios and Shemʿon, the only
      bishops from the province of Mesopotamia to attend the councils, respectively, of Ephesus and
      Chalcedon. The area around Amid was an important center of monasticism with five monasteries
      within the city by 525 (<ref type="cr">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>, Ecclesiastical History,
      VIII.5). Well-known monasteries in the immediate vicinity include those of 1. the Edessenes
      (4th cent., probably on a site just south of the city wall); 2. Yoḥannan Urṭaya (4th cent.,
      north of the city wall), where <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> spent his youth; and 3.
      Zuqnin, the home of the <ref type="cr">Zuqnin Chronicle</ref>. Of importance at a later date
      was the Monastery of Prophet Elijah near the village of Qanqart, ca. 8 km. southwest of Amid
      (attested 11th–19th cent.).</p>
     <p>In the period after the Council of Chalcedon, Amid was a Miaphysite stronghold, and Bp. Mara
      of Amid was one of those bps. expelled from their sees under Emperor Justin I. After a period
      of persecution for the Miaphysites under the Chalcedonian Bp. Abraham bar Kaili, a line of
      Miaphysite bishops was reestablished with the consecration of Eunomius in ca. 546. Among the
      later occupants of the see was <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>. Amid has been the
      seat of the Syr. Orth. patriarchs on several occasions, including a period in the 11th cent.
      after Dionysios IV (1032–42) took refuge in the then Marwānid city to escape persecution in
      Byzantine <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>, during the tenure of Ignatius <ref type="cr"
       >ʿAbdullāh I bar Sṭephanos</ref> (1521–1557), and in 1862–71 when Ignatius Yaʿqub II
      (1847–1871) took up residence in the Yoldat Aloho Church in the wake of disturbances in <ref
       type="cr">Mardin</ref>. The Syr. Orth. see of Amid lapsed with the demise of Metr. Dionysios
      ʿAbd al-Nūr Aslan in 1933.</p>
     <p>The presence of E.-Syr. Christians in Amid is suggested by the inclusion of ‘Amid’ in the
      titles of bishops of Maypherqaṭ from the 12th cent. onwards. The first Chald. patriarch, <ref
       type="cr">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref>, resided in Amid after his return from Rome in 1553. Later,
      Amid became the residence of a new line of Chald. patriarchs from Yawsep I (1681–96) to Yawsep
      V (Augustin Hindi, 1781–1828). The Chald. see of Diyarbakır, vacant after 1923, was revived in
      name in 1966, with residence, however, in Istanbul and jurisdiction over the whole of Turkey
      (vacant since 2005 as of going to press).</p>
     <p>Syriac Christians originally constituted the majority of the Christian population, but came
      to be outnumbered by the Armenians under Ottoman rule. The Melkite community, which had been
      Syriac-speaking in pre-Islamic times, dwindled after the Arab conquest, but was reinforced by
      migrants from <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> in the 17th cent. According to a census conducted in
      1870, the city had a population of 21,372, with 9,814 Muslims, 6,853 Armenian Orth., 831
      Armenian Catholics, 1,434 Syr. Orth., 174 Syr. Catholics, 976 Chald., 305 Melk. Orth., 55
      Melk. Catholics, 650 Protestants and 280 Jews. In 1908, <ref type="cr">Naʿʿūm Fāʾiq</ref>
      published there the first number of his journal <hi rend="italic">Kawkbo d-madnḥo</hi>. In
      1914, the Syriac population of the city is reported to have stood at 8,000, and that of the
      thirty or so nearby villages (including Kaʿbiya, Sharukhiya, Qarabash, Quṭurbul, ʿAyn
      Tannūr/Ali Pınar) at 6,450. Though greatly diminished by the massacres during the First World
      War, a sizeable Christian community remained until relatively recently, with the Syr. Orth.
      community still numbering nearly 1,000 individuals in the early 1960’s. In 2005, the city had
      one resident Syr. Orth. priest and 7 Syr. Orth., 2 Chald., and 2 Armenian families.</p>
     <p>Of the older churches in the city, two, both of them former patriarchal residences, remain
      in regular use: 1. Yoldat Aloho (Syr. Orth., in Lāle Bey Quarter, in the southwest section of
      the old city, 3rd/6th cent.?), with the main church of Yoldat Aloho and that of Mor Yaʿqub
      adjoining it to the north and housing the relics of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>; 2.
      Mar Petion (Chald., in Özdemir Quarter, east of main crossroads). (An Evangelical church
      opened opposite Yoldat Aloho in 2003). Still in situ are: St. George’s (in the citadel, 4th
      cent.?), Latin (Capuchin, in northeast section of old city, 17th cent.), Protestant
      (southeast) and Armenian Catholic (southeast) churches, as well as the Armenian Orth. churches
      of Surp Giragos (adjoining Mar Petion to the east, 16th cent.) and Surp Sarkis (southwest,
      16th cent.) and chapel of Surp Hagop. Two churches were demolished in the 20th cent.: 1.
      Cosmas and Damian (east of Yoldat Aloho, 4th cent.?, Melk. in modern period); 2. the Syr.
      Cath. Church (northeast, 7th cent.?). Among the churches mentioned in historical records, the
      one built by Emperor Heraclius in 628/9 was probably a Syr. Orth. Church, which is to be
      distinguished from the Melk. church (called St. Thomas?) occupying the site of the present
      Great Mosque (see Palmer). Other known churches (some of them possibly identical with those
      already mentioned) include: St. John the Baptist (place of burial, in 649/50, of Bp. Yuḥanon
      of the Arabs), St. Stephen (converted to fire temple in 503), Mor Zʿuro (near Urfa Gate,
      before 503; burial place, in 649/50, of Patr. <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of the Sedre</ref>and
      Shemʿun of Edessa), Mor Shilo (built by Bp. Mara ca. 520), St. Theodore (northeast, Armenian
      in 16th cent.) and Mor Ḥananyo (southeast?). Kırklar Dağı ‘Hill of the Forty’, to the south of
      the city, is probably the site of the Church of the Forty Martyrs built by Yuḥanon Soʿuro of
      Qarṭmin (bp. of Amid 483/4–502), who was responsible also for the construction of the nearby
      Tigris bridge.</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Patr. of the Maronites, author of a Syriac grammar. Born in Ehden, Lebanon, ʿAmīra was sent
      to Rome in 1583, to study at the newly founded Maronite College (1584). Upon his return to
      Lebanon he was ordained priest, immediately followed by his consecration as bp., in 1596. In
      1634 he was elected patr. Belonging to the first generation of Maronite ecclesiastical leaders
      trained in Rome, he was instrumental in bringing the Maronite Church further in line with the
      Roman Catholic Church.</p>
     <p>His significance for Syriac studies lies in the fact that he is the author of a Syr.
      grammar, which he wrote during his stay in Rome and which was published in 1596: <hi
       rend="italic">Grammatica syriaca, sive chaldaica</hi>. After <ref type="cr">Andreas
       Masius</ref>’s publications, which were the first to provide systematic descriptions of the
      Syriac language in Europe (1571), and which served as models for some later scholars, ʿAmīra
      produced an entirely independent grammar, which in comparison with Masius’s work was based on
      a larger corpus of texts, paid more attention to the indigenous Syr. tradition, and included
      more discussion of syntactical problems (Contini). A partial French translation by J. F. de la
      Croix was made in 1681 (apparently unpublished). With the exception of some translations from
      Latin into Syriac for the Maronite Missal (published in Rome between 1592 and 1594), ʿAmīra
      did not publish any other Syriac work. His Arabic publications are all related to his pastoral
      and church-administrative work as bp. and patr.</p>

   </div>
    <div type="body">
     <p>The town of Amyūn is situated 20 km. south of Tripoli (Northern Lebanon), on the road
      between Chekka and Kousba, built on a high, rocky cliff rising above the plains of olives and
      fruit orchards watered by the Qadisha river. This citadel has a long history. Early neolithic
      burial graves are still visible in the rock walls towering over the lower town, and fragments
      of classical carving are built into the walls of the houses along narrow, medieval streets.
      During the period of the <ref type="cr">Crusades</ref>, the town belonged to the Seigneury of
      Besmedin, a branch of the Seigneury of Giblet (Jbeil or Byblos). Several medieval churches
      still function in the town.</p>
     <p>The Church of Mar Phocas, which is nowadays Greek Orthodox, has a simple barrel-vaulted
      nave, a deeply recessed apse and two side-aisles, separated by heavy stone piers with pointed
      arches. Like many of the medieval Lebanese churches, it was built over the foundations of a
      classical temple. Only a few fragments of fresco decoration survive, and these are mostly from
      different periods and differing styles indicating different hands.</p>
     <p>In the apse are the scant remains of an Anastasis painting. Parts of Christ’s flying cloak
      are visible as he pulls Adam out of the grave. Behind Adam is Eve, and behind her is Abel. On
      the other side are David and Solomon, and the remains of a scroll once held by John the
      Baptist. Above the head of Christ is a little flying angel.</p>
     <p>Below the apse, in the lower zone, are eight apostles on either side of Sts. Peter and Paul.
      Most of these saints are too damaged to be identified.</p>
     <p>On the northern wall, near the apse, is a large portrait of St. Philip, with the small
      figure of a donor at his side, also called Philip. On the same wall, toward the west, are the
      remains of <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref> between two standing saints and two flying
      angels. The large piers of the church are decorated on all four sides with remains of paint,
      showing several saints, a portrait of St. Simeon the Younger Thaumaturgos, a portrait of the
      standing St. Phocas, Christ Pantocrator, and an equestrian St. Theodore spearing a dragon.</p>
     <p>These wall paintings are all inscribed in Greek. Some attempt has been made to write in
      Syriac over a long inscription in the lower zone of the apse, with the unfortunate result that
      neither the original Greek, nor the later Syriac is legible. Stylistically, the apse painting
      and the tall portrait of St. Philip closely resemble contemporary wall paintings in 12th-cent.
      Cyprus. The wall paintings on the piers show at least two layers of paint, and whereas the
      bottom layer is most likely 12th cent., the top layers belong to the 13th.</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Large Sasanian city on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, the ruins are near present-day
      Falluja, ca. 60  km. west of <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>. Shapur I (241–72) fortified, or
      rebuilt, a pre-Sasanian town, the official name became Peruz Shapur ‘Victorious Shapur’,
      commemorating his victory over the Roman Emperor Gordian  III in 243. Some sources, however,
      connect the city with Shapur  II (310–79) and his victory over the Roman Emperor Julian in
      363. The city’s popular name ‘Ambāra’ (Arab. <hi rend="italic">al-Anbār</hi>) means ‘magazine;
      storehouse’, and refers to its strategic function as an arsenal of victuals and weapons for
      the fortified places along the western frontier. The earliest reliable information comes from
      the historians Ammianus Marcellinus (XXIV 2,9–22; d. ca. 395) and Zosimus (III 17,3–18,6; ca.
      500). Ammianus saw the city (<hi rend="italic">Piri-sabora</hi>) with his own eyes during the
      campaign of Emperor Julian. He describes it as large and populated, with a citadel and a
      double wall. Zosimus reports that the city (<hi rend="italic">Bērsabōra</hi>) was second in
      rank after the Sasanian capital Ctesiphon. During the first centuries of Islam, al-Anbār
      remained prosperous, being the residence of the Abassid Caliphs al-Saffāḥ (750–54) and
      al-Manṣūr (754–75) until the latter moved to the new capital Baghdad (762). The city declined
      until the end of the first millennium; in 1262 it was sacked by the Mongols.</p>
     <p>Al-Anbār was a see of the Ch. of E., first mentioned in the 5th cent. The main sources
      (surveyed by J.-M. Fiey) are the <ref type="cr">Synodicon Orientale</ref> and the ‘Book of the
      Tower’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-majdal</hi>, ed. H. Gismondi). Several bps. are known, the
      last known was consecrated in 1111. Three of them bacame Cath.: Ṣliba Zka (713–28), Theodosios
      (853–58), and Yoḥannan bar Narsai (884–91). <ref type="cr">Eliya of al-Anbār</ref> was elected
      Patr. in 937, but failed to receive the Caliph’s approval. There were two monasteries in
      al-Anbār: St. Quryaqos and the famous one of Mar Yonan. The Jewish community in al-Anbār
      (probably identical with Pumbedita) was founded in the 4th cent. It was one of the largest in
      Babylonia (the sources are surveyed by A. Oppenheimer). A second Peruz Shapur is on the
      eastern bank of the Tigris near the Khabur inflow.</p>

     <p>City in the historical region of Syria (today in Turkey). Titular see of Syr. Orth., Syr.
      Catholic, Maron., Melk. Orth., Melk. Catholic (united with Alexandria and Jerusalem) and,
      until 1953, Latin patriarchs. Antioch is situated at the foot of Mt. Silpius in the valley of
      the Orontes, approximately 25 km. from the Mediterranean coast. Founded by Seleucus I Nicator
      ca. 300 BC and named after his father Antiochus, Antioch grew rapidly as the capital of the
      Seleucids. For the Romans who took it in 64 BC it was their largest and most prosperous city
      in Asia. Antioch was taken by the Sasanians for the first time in 256, when Shapur I deported
      many of its citizens and settled them in, among other places, the city he named ‘Better is the
      Antioch of Shapur’, the later Gondeshapur (<ref type="cr">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>). After its
      destruction by Khusrau I in 540, the city was rebuilt on a smaller scale by Justinian, only to
      be attacked again by the Persians at the beginning of the 7th cent. and occupied by them for
      over a decade from 611. Antioch was captured by the Arabs in 637/8. Under the Byzantines again
      in 969–1084, it was taken by the Crusaders in 1098. The Frankish Principality of Antioch
      lasted until 1268, when it was conquered by the Mamluks. A minor provincial town under the
      Ottomans and the French mandate, Antioch became the capital of the short-lived Republic of
      Hatay in 1938 before being incorporated, together with the rest of the former district
      (sancak) of Alexandretta, into the Republic of Turkey in 1939.</p>
     <p>The Apostle St. Peter and St. <ref type="cr">Ignatius of Antioch</ref> are reckoned as the
      first and third bishops of Antioch, and it is after them that it later became customary for
      the Maron. patriarchs to adopt the name ‘Peter’ and the Syr. Orth. and Syr. Catholic
      patriarchs the name ‘Ignatius’. The city in which St. Paul preached and the followers of Jesus
      were first called ‘Christian’ soon became the most important center of Christianity in Asia,
      and its see was recognised as ranking alongside those of Rome and Alexandria at the Council of
      Nicaea. The area under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Antioch that later became known as
      ‘patriarchate’ largely coincided with the civil diocese of the ‘East’ (Oriens) — whence the
      title ‘of Antioch and All the East’ still born by the patriarchs  — corresponding roughly to
      the parts of today’s Turkey south of the Taurus, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Holy Land,
      the last of which later formed a separate Patriarchate of <ref type="cr">Jerusalem
     </ref>(although this was recognized only by the Chalcedonian churches). The theological school
      at Antioch which flourished in the 4th and 5th  cent. was to have a major influence on the
      theology of the Ch. of E. through the writings of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>
      and others. Antioch was one of the major battlegrounds in the Christological controversies of
      the 5th and 6th cent. that led to the formation of the Syriac Churches as separate entities
      from the Imperial Church. Among the patriarchs of Antioch resident in Antioch, John I (428–42)
      was a supporter of <ref type="cr">Nestorius</ref>, while Peter the Fuller (468–86, with
      interruptions) and <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref> (512–18, d. 538) were important
      proponents of the Miaphysite teaching.</p>
     <p>Since the expulsion of Severus by Emperor Justin the Syr. Orth. patriarchs have usually been
      unable to reside in, or even visit, their titular see, except on such occasions as when Caliph
      Yazīd II allowed Eliya  I (709–24) to make a solemn entry into the city and consecrate a new
      church there in 721, and during the Crusader period, when the Frankish rulers and Latin clergy
      of the city tended to favor the non-Chalcedonian Christians as their allies against Muslims
      and Melkites. From that period we know of a forced sojourn in Antioch of Athanasios
      (1090–1129) in ca. 1115, as well as of more friendly visits by <ref type="cr">Michael
       Rabo</ref> (1166–99), who is said to have been enthroned on the chair of St. Peter during one
      of his visits in 1168–69, by Ignatius III Dawid (1222–52), who built a residence for himself
      on the outskirts of the city some time before 1246, and by <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon bar
       Maʿdani</ref> (1252–63), who was enthroned on the ‘chair of Great Severus’ in 1253. The Syr.
      Orth. had three churches in the city in 1170 (Yoldat Aloho, Mor Giwargis and Mor Barṣawmo).
      The visit to Antioch by Patr. Ignatius Zakka Iwas in 2000 was probably the first by a Syr.
      Orth. patriarch since the 13th cent.</p>
     <p>In the 1920s there was a small community of Maronites in Antioch, who together with the
      Latin rite Christians numbered about fifty, alongside larger communities of Melkites numbering
      some 4,500 and Armenians numbering 400 in a total population of 20,000–30,000. Today, the city
      still has functioning Melk. Orth. and Latin churches. St. Peter’s Church, or Grotto, the cave
      believed to be the site of the first church in Antioch, lies about 2 km. to the northeast of
      the town center.</p>
     <p>The Black Mountain (the Amanus Range) to the northwest of Antioch was a renowned center of
      monasticism. A number of Syriac liturgical mss. copied there attest to the continued use of
      Syriac alongside Greek and Georgian by Melkite monks in the region in the 11th cent.</p>

     <p>Author of uncertain date, designated ‘rhetor’ and ‘philoponos’, according to a ms. colophon
      from the family of Gurgin (<hi rend="italic">d-beth Gurgin</hi>), and a monk. Nothing is known
      of him apart from his works and a brief report in the Ecclesiastical History of <ref type="cr"
       >Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> to the effect that he lived at the time of the patriarch <ref type="cr"
       >Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> (active in 825), a view which Bar ʿEbroyo declares to be
      generally accepted by his contemporary teachers and elders. Bar ʿEbroyo supports this by
      identifying an unnamed student of Greek poetry in Anṭun’s ‘Rhetoric’ with Dionysios’s brother
       <ref type="cr">Theodosios of Edessa</ref>, translator of the poems of <ref type="cr">Gregory
       of Nazianzus</ref>. The 9th-cent. dating of Anṭun has thus not gone uncontested. Mention of
      his works by later authors first appears in <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref> and Bar
      ʿEbroyo.</p>
     <p>Two mss. in London (Brit. Libr. Add. 17,208 + Dayr al-Suryān 32 and Brit. Libr. Add. 14,726)
      contain all his known shorter writings and fragments of his major work, a treatise on
      rhetoric. The shorter writings comprise a substantial work ‘On Divine Providence’, notable not
      least for its knowledge of medicine, a treatise ‘On the Myron’, in its prologue largely
      identical with that by <ref type="cr">Mushe bar Kipho</ref> and probably dependent upon
      Pseudo-Dionysius, eight poems (five in letter form), and four liturgical hymns.</p>
     <p>His most significant work is his treatise on rhetoric, in five books. Apart from the London
      fragments, the older mss. have perished or are now in a location difficult to access, but some
      copies were made from the late 19th cent. and have survived. These copies preserve the text in
      full, with the exception of the final part of the fifth book. The treatise is unique in Syriac
      literature, with the exception of its partial reproduction and paraphrasing in the ‘Book of
      Dialogues’ of Yaʿqub bar Shakko. It was greatly admired by Bar ʿEbroyo, who cited it
      frequently in his ‘Book of Splendors’ and prefaced it to the ‘Organon’ of <ref type="cr"
       >Aristotle</ref> in the curriculum of ‘external’ (i.e. secular) works he wished to see
      studied in the schools.</p>
     <p>The main importance of the work lies in the evidence it provides of a rhetorical tradition
      in Syriac which has clear points of contact with the Greek (see <ref type="cr"
      >Rhetoric</ref>). It is most unlikely that Anṭun knew Greek, but he mentions having had a
      teacher in the reading of Homer, and much of the treatise can only be understood on the
      supposition that a considerable amount of Greek rhetorical theory had been incorporated into
      Syriac teaching. The work is also remarkable for the range of authors cited in it as
      rhetorical examples. For Anṭun, as for Greek Christian rhetors, Gregory of Nazianzus was the
      supreme model of eloquence, but Anṭun was proud of his Syriac heritage, and in his eyes
      Gregory shared this position with <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>, whose poetry also belonged to
      the sphere of rhetoric. In addition to many Greek and Syriac Christian authors, several pagan
      writers are cited, including Homer, Plutarch, Heliodorus, and an unknown Evodius and (Aramean)
      Wapha. Anṭun also exhibits knowledge of the Platonic political-philosophical concept of the
      philosopher-king, a concept which was also important in the thought of al-Fārābī, the great
      Muslim philosopher who studied with Syro-Arabic Christian Aristotelian philosophers in <ref
       type="cr">Baghdad</ref> in the 10th cent.</p>

    <head>Apamea</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>One of the earliest Hellenistic city foundations in Syria, Apamea, situated on the Orontes
      ca. 90 km. south of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, from the 2nd cent. onwards was an important
      center of Middle- and Neo-Platonist philosophy. Both Numenius (late 2nd cent.) and Iamblichus
      (early 4th cent.) taught here.</p>
     <p>In the first half of the 5th cent., the region of Apamea was home to the ascetic circle
      around <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>. An important bp. of Apamea during Yoḥannan’s
      lifetime was Polychronius, the brother of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, whose
      biblical commentaries, written in Greek (not preserved) are sometimes quoted in the later
      Syriac tradition.</p>
     <p>In the late 5th and the 6th cent., Apamea and the province of Syria Secunda, of which it was
      the capital, became divided between supporters and opponents of the Council of Chalcedon
      (451). The tension between the two groups can be clearly sensed from the correspondence of
       <ref type="cr">Severus of Antioch</ref>, who during his tenure as Patr. (512–18) had
      difficulty imposing his authority on the diocese. Eventually Syria Secunda was instrumental in
      bringing about the restoration of Chalcedonian Orthodoxy in the Eastern Empire under the
      emperors Justin I (518–27) and Justinian (527–65). The Monastery of <ref type="cr">St.</ref>
      <ref type="cr">Maron</ref>, in the Apamea region (although the exact location is not known),
      which was perhaps at the head of a confederation of like-minded monasteries, played an
      important role in these 6th-cent. developments. The Chalcedonian convictions of the monks of
      Saint Maron gradually became disconnected from Melk. (Byzantine) orthodoxy and, from the 7th
      cent. onwards, gave rise to the emergence of an independent branch of Chalcedonian Syriac
      Christianity, which later became known as <ref type="cr">Maronite</ref>. For the Maronites,
      the Apamea region is their cultural and monastic homeland, from which several centuries later,
      they transferred their ecclesiastical center to Lebanon.</p>
     <p>Apamea had several churches, along with a synagogue (uncovered below one of the churches).
      Parts of mosaic floors are preserved. While the primary language of Apamea was Greek, an
      important Syriac inscription, mentioning Bp. Peter of Apamea (and dated to the year 827 ‘in
      the reckoning of the Apamaeans’, i.e., 515/16) was discovered at Maʿar Zayta (a small town to
      the southwest of Maʿarrat al-Nuʿmān). At a short distance from Apamea lies the town of Huarte,
      in which several churches were uncovered, along with a Mithraeum, underneath one of the
      churches. Some 50 km. north of Apamea is the likely place of origin of the famous <ref
       type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref>, with their extraordinary illuminations.</p>
     <p>Apamea was abandoned in the early Islamic period and later fell into ruins. In 1930, a team
      of Belgian archeologists started excavating it. Interrupted during World War II, and resumed
      only in 1965, the excavations during the past several years have been under the direction of
      J.-Ch. Balty.</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Syriac author of 23 ‘Demonstrations’, known as ‘the Persian Sage’. The name Aphrahaṭ, by
      which he is known today, is first found in <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (d. 828). In the
      early 8th cent. <ref type="cr">Giwargi, bp. of the Arab tribes</ref> only knew of him as ‘the
      Persian Sage’ (V. Ryssel, <hi rend="italic">Georgs des Araberbischofs Gedichte und Briefe
     </hi>[1891], 44–54), though the oldest ms. of his works (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,182,
      dated 474) names the author ‘Yaʿqub, the Sage of Persia’. Confirmation of Yaʿqub as his name
      comes from the early Armenian translation and from the Latin author Gennadius (ca. 500),
      though both have mistakenly taken him to be bp. <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> (d.
      338), which is impossible, since the Demonstrations are provided with exact dates: 1–10 are
      dated to 336/7, 11–22 to 343/4, and 23 to August 345. They were clearly written in the Persian
      Empire, and by a person in some sort of authority (the late identification of him as a bp. of
       <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> is baseless). The first group deals largely with
      ascetic topics, and Dem. 6–7 are particularly important witnesses to the role of the <ref
       type="cr">bnay qyāmā</ref> and <ref type="cr">iḥidāye</ref> in the Syriac proto-monastic
      tradition. Many of the second group concern Judaism and are aimed to combat Judaising
      tendencies among Christians. The long Dem. 14 stands apart, being described as a letter
      addressed to the bishops, priests, and people in <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>. Dem.
      21 has as its background Shapur II’s persecution. The final Dem. 23 provides a reply to
      certain questions posed to the author concerning the ‘blessing hidden in the cluster of
      grapes’ (Isaiah 65:8). The Demonstrations constitute the first major literary work in Syriac:
      the opening words of Dems. 1–22 provide an alphabetic acrostic, and several Demonstrations
      contain lengthy passages of carefully balanced artistic prose. Besides their literary
      interest, the Demonstrations are of great importance for the light they shed on many different
      topics, in particular: the character of Christianity in the Persian Empire and its ascetic
      developments, relations with Judaism, the early stages of Shapur’s persecution, and the
      history of the Syriac biblical text, together with its exegesis and Christology.</p>
     <p>The Demonstrations are preserved in four mss., three of which date from the 5th and 6th
      cent. The 5th-cent. Armenian translation (1–19, attributed to Yaʿqub of Nisibis), was first
      published in 1756, over a century before the Syriac became known. There are translations of
      individual Demonstrations into Arabic (parts of 2–4, 6, 9; attributed to <ref type="cr"
       >Ephrem</ref>), Ethiopic (5, 8; attributed to Yaʿqub of Nisibis), and Georgian (6; attributed
      to <ref type="cr">Hippolytus</ref>).</p>

    <head>Apocalypses</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>Apocalypses, or Revelations, aim to disclose eschatological events and in order to enhance
      their authority they are often attributed to past authorities; sometimes it is an angel who
      makes the disclosure. Such works tend to be produced at times of crises in society.</p>
     <p>Two Apocalypses are transmitted in the great Milan ms. of the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>
      OT (7a1), the ‘Revelation of Baruch’ and ‘The Book of Ezra the Scribe who is called
      Shelathiel’ (usually referred to as IV Esdras); both are edited (by S. Dedering and R.
      Bidawid) in <hi rend="italic">Vetus Testamentum Syriace</hi> IV.3 (1973). Lections from both
      works are sometimes found, indicating their quasi-canonical authority. Both Apocalypses are of
      Jewish origin and are usually dated ca. AD 100; their original language was probably Hebrew.
      The Revelation of Baruch survives complete only in Syriac and an Arabic translation (ed. F.
      Leemhuis, A. F. J. Klijn, G. J. H. van Gelder, 1986) made from Syriac (a few fragments only
      are known in Greek); by contrast, IV  Esdras (confusingly also called II Esdras in modern
      translations of the Apocrypha/Deuterocanonical books) is also known in Latin, Armenian, Coptic
      (a fragment), Ethiopic, and Georgian; the intermediary Greek, however, is lost.</p>
     <p>The NT Apocalypse of John is not part of the Peshitta canon, but two later W.-Syr.
      translations were subsequently made, one in the 6th cent. (ed. J. Gwynn, 1897, repr. 2005),
      the other ca. 615, by <ref type="cr">Ṭumo of Ḥarqel</ref> (photographic ed., A. Vööbus, CSCO
      400, 1978). Older printed editions of the Peshitta NT include the Ḥarqlean version, while more
      recent ones give the 6th-cent. version. The book only occasionally received a commentary
      (notably by <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>).</p>
     <p>The Apocalypse of Paul purports to describe what Paul saw when he was raised to the ‘third
      heaven’ (2 Cor 12:2), and how he was given a tour of both paradise and the place of
      punishment. The work, which was originally written in Greek (ed. K. Tischendorff, <hi
       rend="italic">Apocalypses</hi>
      <hi rend="italic">Apocryphae</hi> [1866, repr. 1966], 34–69), proved to be immensely popular,
      and was translated into many languages, including Syriac (ed. G. Ricciotti, in <hi
       rend="italic">Orientalia</hi>2 [1933], 1–25, 120–49; ET by J. Perkins, <hi rend="italic"
       >JAOS</hi> 8 [1866], 183–212). It has usually been thought that the earliest form of the
      Apocalypse goes back to the 3rd cent., and that a ‘second edition’ was later issued, claiming
      that it had been discovered in a house in Tarsus in 388 (or possibly 420). More recently it
      has been proposed that the supposed ‘second edition’ was in fact the original form of the
      Apocalypse. The Syriac translation places the Tarsus narrative at the end, and has a preface
      by the translator at the beginning. The edition of a variant Syriac version is being prepared
      by A. Desreumaux. The Coptic Apocalypse of Paul, found at Nag Hammadi is a different work (ed.
      with FT, J.-M. Rosenthiel, 2005).</p>
     <p>The turbulent political events of the 7th cent. gave rise to a number of texts of an
      apocalyptic nature, this time all composed in Syriac. The Persian invasion of the eastern
      provinces of the Byzantine Empire, capturing <ref type="cr">Jerusalem</ref> in 614 and the
      relic of the Cross, followed eventually by Heraclius’s successful compaigns and recovery of
      the Cross (630), probably provide the scenario for a poem (transmitted in three different
      forms) on Alexander the Great ‘and the Gates of the North’, attributed to <ref type="cr"
       >Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, but evidently composed between 630 and 636 (ed. with GT, G. J.
      Reinink, CSCO 454–5, 1983; ET in E. A. W. Budge, <hi rend="italic">The History of Alexander
       the Great</hi>[1889, repr. 1976], 163–200). This draws on a christianized form of the <ref
       type="cr">Alexander</ref> legend from not long before 630 which proved very influential
      (Budge, <hi rend="italic">History of Alexander</hi>, 144–58 [ET], 255–75 [Syr.]).</p>
     <p>Another Apocalypse making use of the theme of the ‘Gates of the North’ is the Syriac
      Apocalypse of Daniel (ed. with ET, M. Henze, 2001; ed. with Esperanto tr., M. Slabczyk, 2000).
      This work is completely different from the Greek Apocalypses of Daniel; Syriac is clearly its
      original language and parts of it are parallel with another Syriac apocryphon, the ‘Young
      Daniel, concerning the End’ (ed. H. Schmold, Ph. D. Diss., Hamburg; 1972). The lack of any
      indication of contemporary events, prior to ‘the End’, make it difficult to date these works,
      but the first half of the 7th cent. seems likely.</p>
     <p>A <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> ‘On the End’, wrongly attributed to <ref type="cr"
       >Ephrem</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Sermo</hi> III.5; ed. E. Beck, CSCO 320–1, 1972), which also
      makes use of the christianized Alexander legend, has been dated to ca. 640, soon after the
      Arab conquests, though it could alternatively come from a few decades later in the 7th cent.
      The unrelated Latin sermon ‘on the End’, also attributed to Ephrem, is probably later than the
      Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius.</p>
     <p>The Second Civil War (683–92) and the plague of 686–7 gave rise to the inclusion of a number
      of apocalyptic features in the final book 15 of <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Penkaye</ref>’s
      ‘Book of the Main Points’, written ca. 687 in north Mesopotamia. The apocalyptic preface to
      the <ref type="cr">Testament of our Lord</ref>, translated by Yaʿqub (probably, of <ref
       type="cr">Edessa</ref>) in 686/7 will also date from that time if the preface was indeed the
      work of the translator.</p>
     <p>The immensely influential <ref type="cr">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</ref>, attributed to
      the bp. of that name who was martyred in 312 very probably dates from 691/2, the time of ʿAbd
      al-Malik’s tax reforms and the building of the Dome of the Rock (ed. with GT G. J. Reinink,
      CSCO 540–1, 1993; ET in P. J. Alexander, <hi rend="italic">The Byzantine Apocalyptic Tradition
     </hi>[1985], 36–51; partial ET in A. Palmer, <hi rend="italic">The seventh century in the
       West-Syriac chronicles</hi>[1993], 230–42). This draws on themes found in the <ref type="cr"
       >Cave of Treasures</ref>, the <ref type="cr">Julian Romance</ref>, and the Alexander legend,
      and foretells, in eschatological terms, the end of Arab rule. Related to Pseudo-Methodius, but
      from slightly later, is the ‘Edessene Fragment’ (ed. F. Nau, in <hi rend="italic">JA</hi> 11.9
      [1917], 415–71; ET in Palmer, <hi rend="italic">The seventh century</hi>, 243–50); following
      the example of Pseudo-Methodius, it draws further on the Julian Romance, and also on the
      legend of Queen Helena and Judas Quryaqos, for its portrayal of the Last World Emperor on
      Golgotha. The apocalyptic section in the <ref type="cr">Gospel of the Twelve Apostles</ref>
      attributed to John ‘the Little’, is thought to date from much the same time.</p>
     <p>The extended apocalyptic section in the legend of Bḥira (see <ref type="cr">Sargis
       Bḥira</ref>) probably dates from about the mid-9th cent. in its present form, but its roots
      may go back to the end of the reign of Maʾmūn (813–33).</p>
     <p>‘The Question asked by Ezra in the desert with his disciple Carpus concerning the end of the
      times of the Ishmaelites’ (ed. with GT, F. Baethgen, in <hi rend="italic">ZAW</hi> 6 [1886],
      193–211; ed. with FT, J.-B. Chabot, in <hi rend="italic">Revue</hi>
      <hi rend="italic">sémitique</hi> 2 [1894], 242–50, 333–46) has been ascribed to many different
      dates, ranging from the 7th to 11th/12th cent. An Ethiopic version (unpublished) is also
      known.</p>
     <p>The composition of pseudepigraphical apocalypses could also be for the purpose of personal
      ambition, as is indicated by a passage in <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>’s Chronicle
      (XI.22) where he tells how Quryaqos bp. of Segestan and Bar Salta of <ref type="cr"
       >Reshʿayna</ref> composed an ‘Apocalypse of Enoch’, foretelling the reign of Marwān (II) and
      his son, which they presented to Marwān in order to win his support in church affairs.</p>

     <ab>Acacius (late 5th cent.) <label type="affiliation">Church of the East</label>

   </div>
    <div type="body">
     <p>Bp. of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>and Cath. (484–495/6). Aqaq headed the Ch. of
      E. during a critical period of its history, when it adopted a strictly dyophysite Christology.
      Aqaq had studied at the <ref type="cr">School of Edessa</ref>, where he became acquainted with
      the works of <ref type="cr">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. Among his fellow students were <ref
       type="cr">Narsai</ref> and <ref type="cr">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref>. Aqaq’s predecessor,
      Cath. Babowai, who had a strained relationship with Barṣawma, had also come into conflict with
      the Persian Emperor Peroz and was arrested and executed by the latter in 484. When Aqaq took
      office, therefore, the situation of Christianity in the Persian Empire was extremely
      precarious. Our main source for the history of his period is the <ref type="cr">Synodicon
       Orientale</ref>. There is no evidence of Aqaq’s involvement in a synod held in <ref type="cr"
       >Beth Lapaṭ</ref> in April 484. This may have been a limited synod of Barṣawma’s followers,
      of which no report is transmitted (and which Barṣawma himself later revoked). It was in the
      wake of this synod that Babowai was arrested and executed, and replaced by Aqaq. At a
      subsequent synod, held in Beth ʿEdray, in August-September 485 (of which also no report is
      preserved), peace between Barṣawma and Aqaq was established. A number of letters from this
      period, included in the Synodicon, confirm that Barṣawma and his followers eventually
      submitted to Aqaq. The stage was thus set for the Synod of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, of Febr. 486,
      in which a unified church, under Aqaq’s leadership, adopted dyophysite Christology.
      Additionally, measures were taken to restrain the (excessive) influence of ascetics outside
      their monasteries and to make marriage the preferred status for all clergy, including bishops,
      celibacy being relegated only to monasteries. The specific context of these measures is not
      yet clear. Should they be understood in response to ideas prevailing in the Zoroastrian
      society, or as reactions to over-active wandering monks, who also may have propagated
      Miaphysitism among Persian Christians? Apart from the information in the Synodicon, very
      little is known about Aqaq. The Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref> attributes to him a
      treatise ‘On faith’, written against the Miaphysites, and three discourses on fasting, none of
      which is preserved. The Chronicle also reports that Aqaq translated into Persian a treatise on
      the Christian faith by <ref type="cr">Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye</ref>, which was presented to the
      Persian emperor Qawad.</p>

      been the object of significant scholarly research (see, e.g., Bergsträsser). Much less
      attention has, however, been paid to the opposite phenomenon: translations from Arabic into
      Syriac. It has even been suggested (by <ref type="cr">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> in his
      discussions with the vizier al-Maghribī) that the absence of such translations are proof of
      the superiority of Syriac science and culture. As a matter of fact, however, the Syrians
      already had translations from Arabic some time before Eliya. One may distinguish six
      different, unrelated fields:</p>
     <p>1. The earliest category consists of ascetical and hagiographic material related to the life
      and spirituality of the monks from the Egyptian desert. Though most of these Syriac texts were
      translated from a Greek original (e.g the apophthegmata by <ref type="cr">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>),
      at least a few seem to have had an Arabic original, which in its turn goes back to a Coptic
      Vorlage: a panegyric on John the Small by a monk of <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> and
      the biography of Shenute by his disciple Besa (10th cent.).</p>
     <p>2. The second field covers a few writings pertaining to Syriac entertainment literature,
      such as the stories of <ref type="cr">Kalila and Dimna</ref> (11th cent., by an E.-Syr.
      priest, in addition to an earlier Syriac version made from Pahlavi in the 7th cent.), ‘<ref
       type="cr">Sindbad</ref> the wise’,<hi rend="italic"></hi>and the tale of the ‘Ten viziers
      and the son of King Azad-Bekht’.</p>
     <p>3. The next category is constituted by medical texts of Greek origin, which were translated
      in the first Abbasid period. Though in most cases these texts were translated directly from
      the Greek original into Syriac (which served as the basis of a subsequent Arabic translation),
      there are a few instances in which Arabic served as the intermediary between Greek and Syriac.
      Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq mentions that his co-religionist Yūḥannā b. Māsawayh, the private physician of
      several caliphs, requested that Ḥunayn’s nephew Ḥubaysh translate into Syriac three medical
      works by <ref type="cr">Galen</ref>, which were already available in an Arabic version. We may
      assume that the reason behind this request was that the very critical Ibn Māsawayh held that
      Syriac was more appropriate than Arabic for expressing scientific idioms. A Syriac version of
      Ḥunayn’s Arabic treatise <hi rend="italic">al-Masāʾil al-ṭibbiyya</hi>‘Book of medical
      questions’ is preserved in some late Chald. mss., through there is no information about the
      translator (for discussion, see Teule, forthcoming).</p>
     <p>4. <ref type="cr">Bar</ref> ʿ<ref type="cr">Ebroyo</ref> had a good knowledge of
      Muslim-Arabic literature. Many of his works can be characterized as sometimes literal,
      sometimes paraphrastic translations/adaptations of Arabic philosophical and religious
      writings, such as the ‘Ethicon’ and the ‘Book of the Dove’ (based on Ghazālī), the <hi
       rend="italic">Swād supyā</hi> (based on Ibn Sinā), etc. In these cases, however, the author
      did not intend to make translations, and the origin of the source text was not revealed.
      Nevertheless, Bar ʿEbroyo did also compose several translations that were meant as such: the
       <hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-išārāt wa-al-tanbīhāt</hi> by Ibn Sīna (Syriac <hi rend="italic"
       >Ktobo d-remze wa-mʿironwoto d-Abu</hi>ʿ<hi rend="italic">Ali bar Sīnā</hi>), in which he
      acknowledges the authorship of Ibn Sīnā and does justice to the Islamic context of this work,
      Athīr al-Dīn al-Abharī’s <hi rend="italic">Zubdat al-Asrār</hi> (lost), and possibly Ibn
      Sinā’s ‘Medical Canon’. Bar ʿEbroyo’s translation activities are to be understood in the
      context of the growing acceptance of Muslim cultural and religious influences characteristic
      of the so-called <ref type="cr">Syriac Renaissance</ref>.</p>
     <p>In Bar ʿEbroyo’s writings, one can also find several quotations (in Syriac) from verses of
      the Qurʾān. We have no certainty about a complete Syriac translation of this work, but <ref
       type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>gives literal translations of several <hi rend="italic"
       >sūra</hi>s in his ‘Treatise against the Muslims’.</p>
     <p>5. The most important category is composed of theological writings translated from Latin or
      other European languages into Arabic by Western missionaries (16th cent. and later) with the
      help of local Christians, which served as the basis for new translations into Syriac. Examples
      are the <hi rend="italic">Maḥzitā mriqtā</hi> ‘the Polished Mirror’ by the Chald. Patr. <ref
       type="cr">Yawsep II</ref> (d. 1713), a Uniate apologetic treatise, translated by himself, in
      defense of the Primacy of the Pope, and the ‘Book of the Magnet’, a popular book of moral
      theology. The reason for these translations was that the Christian population under the
      authority of Yawsep II (Northern Mesopotamia) did not have sufficient knowledge of Arabic.
      This is explicitly mentioned by the Chald. priest Khidr from <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> (d.
      1751), who translated into Syriac Arabic versions of European works or original Arabic
      treatises composed by Maron. or Syr. Catholic authors. The priest Yawsep Abraham from Rāwandūz
      (1832) translated the <hi rend="italic">Mizān al-zamān</hi> ‘the Balance of Time’ an
      originally Italian work, which was popular in Uniate circles, as well as some other
      theological and spiritual treatises. He also made a Syriac translation (from Arabic) of the NT
      Catholic Letters. An Arabic work by the zealous defender of the Uniate cause, the Melk. author
      ʿAbdallāh Zākhir (d. 1748) is also extant in a Syriac translation, probably made in
      Mesopotamia (on the Trinity and Incarnation). This translation activity from Arabic
      substantially diminished in the 19th cent., when the Chald. clergy had direct access to Latin
      and Italian theological writings.</p>
     <p>6. Some modern works written by authors like Bp. <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon Dolabani</ref> or
      Patr. <ref type="cr">Ignatius Afram Barsoum</ref>(especially his history of Syriac
      literature, translated into Syriac under the title <hi rend="italic">Brule bdire</hi>) were
      translated from Arabic into Syriac.</p>

    <head>Aramaic</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>The Aramaic language belongs to the Northwest Semitic subfamily within the larger family of
      Semitic languages. To the same subfamily belong among others Hebrew, Phoenician, and Ugaritic.
      Aramaic itself consists of a great number of language forms (and indeed languages), spoken and
      written in many different scripts over a period of 3000 years. Aramaic always co-existed and
      interacted with other, related or non-related, languages. Among the Aramaic languages <ref
       type="cr">Syriac</ref> is by far the best documented language. Geographically, Aramaic first
      was used in various locations of the ‘Fertile Crescent’, in Syria and Mesopotamia. It later
      spread all over the Middle East and well into Central Asia. From the 6th cent. BC to the 7th
      cent. AD, Aramaic, in a variety of interrelated language forms, or ‘dialects’, was the most
      widespread language of the Middle East, co-existing first with Old Persian (6th–4th cent. BC),
      and then with Greek (3rd  cent. BC – 7th cent. AD), and Middle Persian (3rd– 7th cent. AD).
      Under the dominance of Arabic and Islam, Aramaic lived on among various religious minorities,
      Syriac Christianity being the most important among them. In the third millennium AD, Aramaic
      and Syriac are used by a few million people — Christians, Jews, Samaritans, and Mandaeans — in
      liturgy, literature, and/or in spoken dialects in the Middle East, Southern India, and the
      worldwide diasporas.</p>
     <p>Various scholarly attempts have been made at classifying the Aramaic languages. One among
      them, first proposed by J. Fitzmyer, and slightly adapted by S. Kaufman among others, has
      become widely used. It is based on a five-fold division of Aramaic linguistic history.</p>
     <p>1. Old Aramaic (ca. 900 – ca. 600 BC). Aramaic was used by semi-autonomous <ref type="cr"
       >Aramean</ref> tribes in Syria, Palestine, and Mesopotamia. Royal and funerary inscriptions
      of the <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> region exhibit a relatively, but not entirely, unified
      language in the Phoenician sphere of influence, while the bilingual inscription of the Tell
      Fakhariyya statue (northeast Syria) points to an Akkadian linguistic and cultural context. The
      script is nearly identical to the one found in the Phoenician inscriptions, from which it was
      borrowed.</p>
     <p>2. Imperial, or Official Aramaic (ca. 600 – ca. 200 BC). Already in the later days of the
      Neo-Assyrian Empire (following the loss of independence of the Aramean city states), Aramaic
      began to be used for trade and communication. The expansion of Aramaic went on in the
      Neo-Babylonian Empire and culminated in the ‘official’ status that Aramaic achieved (along
      with Persian and Elamite) in the Achaemenid Persian Empire (mid-6th cent. – 330 BC). Along
      with inscriptions, a great number of texts on papyrus, parchment, and ostraca have been
      unearthed in Egypt. They evidence the use of Aramaic in official documents issued by, and
      addressed to, the Persian administration, in correspondence of a more private character, and
      in literary compositions. The Aramaic documents in the biblical book of Ezra and their
      narrative framework represent the same type of language. The official use of Aramaic implied
      that there was a certain linguistic and orthographical standard, even if individual texts
      often deviated from it. This standard remained authoritative for several centuries after the
      fall of the Persian Empire. Its literary variant has been called ‘Standard Literary
      Aramaic’.</p>
     <p>3. Middle Aramaic (ca. 200 BC – ca. 250 AD). First, there is the continued use of the
      earlier standardized language, in such texts as the Aramaic chapters of the biblical book of
      Daniel, the Aramaic portions of the Dead Sea documents, and the earliest layer of the Jewish
      Targumim, or translations of the Hebrew Bible (Targum Onkelos for the Pentateuch and Targum
      Jonathan for the Prophets). Second, there are corpora of Aramaic inscriptions, produced in the
      Nabataean Empire (which had Petra as its capital), and in the city states of Ḥaṭra, Palmyra,
      and <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>. These lost their independence in the 2nd and 3rd cent. AD.
      The languages of these places each slightly differ from one another and they are written in
      slightly different scripts, derived from the script used in the Persian period. Nabataean
      Aramaic exhibits features that are due to contact with Old North Arab­ian, which was widely
      spoken throughout the Nabatean Empire.</p>
     <p>4. Late Aramaic (3rd cent. to ca. 1200 AD). From this period literary texts are preserved
      which received classical status in at least four different religious communities. At the same
      time, a clear distinction emerges between West-Aramaic and East-Aramaic dialects.</p>
     <p>West-Aramaic texts were produced by Jews (Palestinian Targumim, Aramaic portions in the
      Palestinian Talmud and in the Midrashim, Aramaic compositions preserved among the Cairo
      Genizah documents  — many of the texts mentioned represent the Galilean Aramaic dialect),
      Samaritans (Targumim, hymns, and prose compositions); and Christians of the Jerusalem area
       (<ref type="cr">Christ­ian Palestinian Aramaic</ref>).</p>
     <p>East-Aramaic texts were produced by Jews (parts of the Babylonian Talmud and Gaonic
      literature), Mandaeans (classical Mandaic literature), and Christians (Syriac). The status of
      Syriac has been somewhat disputed. While Syriac traditionally has been considered the
      westernmost of the East-Aramaic languages, some scholars now tend to classify it as a separate
      branch of late Aramaic. The language of <ref type="cr">Mani</ref> and of the early Manicheans
      must have been close to Syriac, but next to nothing has survived.</p>
     <p>Jewish Aramaic texts are written in the Hebrew square script, which itself is an adaptation
      of the earlier Aramaic script. Samaritan Aramaic is written in a separate script, which
      derives from the earlier Hebrew script. Christian-Palestinian Aramaic is written in a <ref
       type="cr">script</ref> that is related to Esṭrangela, and Mandaic has its own script, likely
      derived from the Parthian/Late Iranian scripts. An interesting genre that existed across
      religious borders is that of the incantations written on ‘magic bowls’: texts that are very
      similar exist in Jewish (Babylonian) Aramaic, Mandaic, and Syriac (written either in
      Esṭrangela or in a different script, which has been called ‘Proto-Manichean’).</p>
     <p>Each of these languages had its heyday in the pre-Islamic period, when the literary
      languages to a large extent reflected, and were nourished by, the spoken languages. In the
      Islamic period, when Arabic became more prominent, the literary languages gradually became
      disconnected from the waning spoken dialects, which survived in geographical and social
      isolation.</p>
     <p>5. Modern Aramaic, or Neo-Aramaic (to the present day). While the classical languages,
      shaped and standardized in the previous period, continued to be transmitted and written — and
      do so up to the present day  — the spoken variants started having their own history, much of
      which went unrecorded. It is only in the 17th cent. that some dialects began to be written for
      the first time. This happened in Northern Iraq with Modern Jewish Aramaic and with Modern
      Syriac (see <ref type="cr">Sureth</ref>), which was written in and around <ref type="cr"
       >Alqosh</ref>. In the 19th cent., under the impulse of American missionaries, a new literary
      language was created for the Christians of <ref type="cr">Urmia</ref> and its surroundings.
      First used for a new translation of the Bible, Literary Urmia Aramaic later was adapted and
      upgraded to serve as the vehicle of the <ref type="cr">Assyrian</ref> identity. As such it is
      still used today among E.-Syr. Christians in the Middle East and in the worldwide <ref
       type="cr">diaspora</ref>.</p>
     <p>The modern spoken dialects are generally subdivided as follows:</p>
     <p>a. West-Neo-Aramaic, spoken in Maʿlula and in a few neighboring villages to the north of
      Damascus by Christians (Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic) and by some Muslims. This language
      may be seen as an offshoot of West-Aramaic, described under 4. Some texts are available in
      contemporary scholarly transliterations.</p>
     <p>b. Central-Neo-Aramaic, of which the main dialect is <ref type="cr">Ṭuroyo</ref>, spoken in
       <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, mainly by Syr. Orth. Christians. The language is now
      widespread among the Syr. Orth diaspora. There have been a few attempts to write it down, most
      successfully among the Swedish communities (in Latin script).</p>
     <p>c. North-East-Neo-Aramaic, spoken to the east of the Tigris, in Eastern Turkey, Persian
      Kurdistan, and Northern Iraq (north of <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>) by both Christians and
      Jews. Due to massive relocation throughout the 20th cent., originally distinct languages have
      been mixed and cases of Koine formation have emerged. Here again, many speakers live in the
      diaspora; Jewish Aramaic lives on in Israel.</p>
     <p>d. South-East-Neo-Aramaic, represented by much endangered Mandaic dialects, spoken in
      southern Iraq and western Iran.</p>
     <p>Each of these many modern dialects carries its own cultural and religious tradition.
      Linguistically they share a number of features, particularly in the radical transformation of
      the verbal system. In the lexicon, many loanwords were borrowed from the surrounding languages
      along with phonetic, morphological, and syntactical features.</p>
     <p>In the Syriac tradition the term <hi rend="italic">ārāmāyā</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
       >oromoyo</hi>) is often used, along with <hi rend="italic">suryāyā</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
       >suryoyo</hi>), to denote the Syriac language. Syriac rewriting of texts originally composed
      in other Aramaic languages may be found in the Aramaic sections of the Old Testament and in
      such texts as the story of <ref type="cr">Aḥiqar</ref>. An awareness of an Aramean unity,
      based on the language (<hi rend="italic">leššānā</hi> / <hi rend="italic">lešono</hi>) and the
      written tradition (<hi rend="italic">seprā</hi> / <hi rend="italic">sepro</hi>), extending
      from the first Chaldean and Assyrian kings to the Christian Syrians, can be found in the
      second Appendix added to the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>, which deals with
      ‘the kingdoms that have been established in Antiquity by our race, (that of) the Arameans,
      namely the descendants of Aram, who were called Syrians or inhabitants of Syria’ (ed. J. B.
      Chabot, text in vol. 4, 748–51 ; FT in vol. 3, 442–7). Among the present-day Syr. Christians
      the Aramaic heritage is particularly emphasized by the Syr. Orth.</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Arameans feature in the annals of the Assyrian kings for some four centuries (ca. 1100–700
      BC), apparently having settled more or less all around the Fertile Crescent; the geographical
      term <ref type="cr">Beth Aramaye</ref> in Syriac sources reflects their presence in Babylonia
      as recorded in the Assyrian annals. In the course of the 10th cent. BC a number of small
      independent Aramean kingdoms, using <ref type="cr">Aramaic</ref> in their inscriptions,
      emerged in what is today Syria, though over the course of the next two centuries they all
      became subject to the Assyrian Empire, a fate shared with Israel and Judah. The often hostile
      relations between the Aramean kings and those of Israel and Judah are related in the OT (Kings
      and Chron.). Syriac readers of the <ref type="cr">Peshitta</ref>, however, would have known
      these (with the exception of Rezin) as ‘Edomites’, rather than ‘Arameans’, since the Syriac
      translators evidently thought that the Arameans lived only to the East of the Euphrates (thus
      Laban remains an ‘Aramean’, Gen. 31:20). In the Peshitta NT, by contrast, ‘Aramean’ renders
      ‘Hellene’ in the sense of ‘gentile, pagan’ (e.g. Acts 21:28; Rom. 1:16). At some point a
      distinction was introduced between the two senses, ethnic (<hi rend="italic">ārāmāyā</hi>) and
      pagan (<hi rend="italic">armāyā</hi>); the first definite attestation for the latter is in a
       <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> by <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (ed. Bedjan, V, 474)
      where the three-syllable form is demanded by the meter (<hi rend="italic">armāyā</hi> is the
      vocalization that is later provided for all the NT passages).</p>
     <p>In many Syriac writers <hi rend="italic">Ārāmāyā</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Suryāyā</hi> are
      synonyms; normally this refers to the language, but on occasion they are used as alternate
      ethnic terms: thus in the early Syriac translation of <ref type="cr">Eusebius</ref>’s
      ‘Ecclesiastical History’ <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref> is described both as a <hi
       rend="italic">suryāyā</hi> (ed. Wright, 183) and as an <hi rend="italic">ārāmāyā</hi> (243).
      Likewise <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, in his ‘Encheiridion’ and elsewhere, speaks of
      ‘we Suryāye, or Ārāmāye’. This equation is further elaborated in Appendix II to <ref type="cr"
       >Michael Rabo</ref>’s Chronicle. In modern times the ethnic identity of ‘Aramean’ has been
      taken up in some circles of the W.-Syr. <ref type="cr">diaspora</ref> as a corrective to the
      popularity of <ref type="cr">Assyrian</ref> themes.</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Capital of modern Kurdistan, in eastern Iraq. It was already inhabited in the 4th millennium
      BC; in the oldest cuneiform texts it is called <hi rend="italic">Urbilum</hi> (Assyrian <hi
       rend="italic">Arbaʾilu</hi>). One of the stations along the royal road between Sardes and
      Persepolis, it was a cultic center, with a temple devoted to the fertility goddess Ishtar, as
      well as a center of commerce and a main point on the caravan routes. It was held successively
      by the Babylonians, Persians, and Greeks, and it was very near Arbela that Darius III was
      defeated by Alexander the Great (331 BC). It was during Alexander’s rule that the country
      surrounding Arbela became known as <ref type="cr">Adiabene</ref> (Syr. <hi rend="italic"
       >Ḥadyāb</hi>), which later became part of the Parthian Empire, and eventually a governor’s
      seat during the Sasanian period. In the 1st cent. AD, Adiabene became an independent kingdom,
      subject to the Parthian king, but it remained on the periphery of the battle zone between Rome
      and Parthia. It was in Adiabene, according to <ref type="cr">Josephus</ref>, that the royal
      family converted to Judaism in the 1st cent. AD.</p>
     <p>Arbela was christianized at a very early date and its inhabitants quickly became the victims
      of persecution by the local governor. The history of its Christian beginnings is recounted in
      the Chronicle of Arbela, a late and dubious mélange of biographical sketches of the twenty
      early bishops of Arbela (ca. 104–511). According to this Chronicle, Pekhida, a disciple of
      Addai, became the first bp.; during the tenure of Isḥaq, the third bp., the first church in
      Arbela was built. The Chronicle also bears testimony — and this may be the most historical
      witness of this text — that many of Arbela’s bishops and faithful suffered martyrdom at the
      hands of the Persians. The <ref type="cr">Acts of Mari</ref>, a seemingly more reliable
      source, claims rather that Aggai and Mari, missionaries from <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, were
      the first evangelists of Adiabene, and its first bps. Arbela was for some time the
      metropolitan seat of the region of Adiabene, and boasted of several important figures as
      bishops — of whom three later became patriarchs  — who appear in the signatory lists of the
      synods of the Ch. of E. A Christian school located in Arbela also produced a number of
      important monastic figures and bps. In 1295, a second Mongol invasion destroyed the Christian
      churches, killed many Christians, and drove the surviving Christians into other regions.
      Subsequent persecutions were sufficiently harsh that, by the end of the 17th cent., there were
      no remaining Christians in Arbela; small groups had begun to re-immigrate in the early part of
      the 20th cent.</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Greek Philosopher. In Late Antiquity the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle were considered
      to be in harmony, and not in conflict; accordingly the syllabus for studying philosophy began
      with Aristotle (commencing with his logical works, the ‘Organon’, or ‘Tool’), leaving Plato to
      the climax. This accounts for the fact that the early books of the ‘Organon’ (‘Categories’,
      ‘On Interpretation’, and ‘Prior Analytics’ [at first only to I.7]) were the first works of
      Aristotle to be translated (along with <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Introduction’), and it
      is only these that actually survive, although there is evidence that much more was translated;
      it also accounts for the fact that no genuine works by Plato were ever translated into <ref
       type="cr">Syriac</ref>.</p>
     <p>The Syriac translations fall into three main periods: 1. the earliest, anonymous,
      translations probably belonging to the early 6th cent.; these survive, and are confined to the
      early books of the ‘Organon’; 2. the 7th- and early 8th-cent. revisions by <ref type="cr"
       >Athanasios of Balad</ref>, <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Giwargi
       bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>, several of which survive; the later books of the ‘Organon’ were
      also translated by Athanasios, but these are no longer extant; Ya<ref type="cr">ʿ</ref>qub
      evidently knew the ‘Metaphysics’, but that work appears never to have been translated into
      Syriac; 3. further revisions and new translations made in the course of the ‘translation
      movement’ patronised by the Abbasid caliphs; the new translations also included many other
      works, beyond the ‘Organon’ (see Peters); hardly any of these survive in their original form,
      since they were usually made just to serve as the basis for further translation into Arabic;
      some use of them, however, was made by <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> in his ‘Cream of
      Wisdom’ and elsewhere.</p>
     <p>The earliest Syriac commentators, (for whom, see Hugonnard-Roche, <hi rend="italic">La
       logique</hi>, 123–291), <ref type="cr">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref>, <ref type="cr"
      >Proba</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Pawlos the Persian</ref>, all belong to the early or mid-6th
      cent. (on internal evidence the 5th-cent. date sometimes given to Proba cannot be correct). In
      the 7th cent. <ref type="cr">Severos Sebokht</ref> wrote on syllogisms, while Athanasios of
      Balad wrote an Introduction to Aristotelian logic, and Ya<ref type="cr">ʿ</ref>qub of Edessa
      provided an ‘Encheiridion’ of philosophical terms. Giwargi’s revision of the first three books
      of the Organon (including the whole of the ‘Prior Analytics’) is accompanied by introductions
      to a number of the books, as well as annotation. E.-Syr. authors from <ref type="cr">Gabriel
       Qaṭraya</ref> and <ref type="cr">Babai</ref> onwards also show an awareness of Aristotle’s
      logical works, and writings dealing with topics in the ‘Organon’ by <ref type="cr">Michael
       Badoqa</ref>, <ref type="cr">Ishoʿbokht</ref>, <ref type="cr">Silwanos of Qardu</ref> (who
      knows all the books of the ‘Organon’; CSCO 464, p. 35), <ref type="cr">Theodoros bar
       Koni</ref>, and others survive, but no specific commentaries are preserved. A glimpse at the
      translation movement in action is given by <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> in his Letters 43
      and 48, on translating the ‘Topics’. From the late 12th cent. a commentary reaching the
      ‘Analytics’ by <ref type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> survives (ms. Cambridge Gg. 2.14). In
      the early 13th cent. both <ref type="cr">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref> and <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub
       bar Shakko</ref> (in his ‘Dialogues’) are concerned with related topics; a little later Bar
      ʿEbroyo, in his <hi rend="italic">Ktobo d-boboto</hi> covers in brief the whole of the
      ‘Organon’, while his ‘Cream of Wisdom’ serves as a general compendium of almost all aspects of
      Aristotelian philosophy.</p>
     <p>Besides two short biographies (ed. Baumstark, <hi rend="italic">Aristoteles</hi>, 2*–3*), a
      number of works falsely under Aristotle’s name were also translated into Syriac, the most
      notable being the <hi rend="italic">Peri</hi>
      <hi rend="italic">Kosmou</hi> (‘On the universe’; ed. de Lagarde, <hi rend="italic"
       >Analecta</hi>
      <hi rend="italic">Syriaca</hi> , 134–58), translated by Sergios of Reshʿayna. Although it was
      once thought that the Arabic Neoplatonist work known as the ‘Theology of Aristotle’ was
      translated from a lost Syriac text, this is now considered improbable.</p>

    <head>Armenian Christianity, Syriac contacts with</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>Armenia, the geographical area of Armenian Christianity and culture, borders the homeland of
      Syr. Christianity. For centuries, <ref type="cr">Arameans</ref> and Armenians lived together
      in parts of northern Mesopotamia and northern Syria. The main cities of Syr. Christianity,
       <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>(Armenian <hi rend="italic">Uṙhay</hi>) and <ref type="cr"
       >Nisibis</ref>(Armenian <hi rend="italic">Mcbin</hi>) had a mixed population, which included
      Syrians and Armenians. Within the Sasanian Empire, the lines of demarcation between the Ch. of
      E. and the Armenian Church were very porous. The E.-Syr. ecclesiastical province of <ref
       type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>, which since the synod of <ref type="cr">Isḥaq</ref> (410) had
      Nisibis as its metropolitan see, included the dioceses of Arzun, Qardu, Beth Zabdai, Beth
      Rahimai, and Beth Moksaye, which all had large Armenian populations and which occasionally
      show up as dioceses of the Armenian Church. In these and in other borderlands, there must have
      been a significant amount of bilingualism, reflecting a ‘veritable interpenetration’ between
      the two groups (Garsoïan 1992, 63).</p>
     <p>In the 1st cent. BC, the western part of Armenia was incorporated into the Roman Empire,
      while the larger part (‘Great Armenia’) remained within the Iranian sphere of influence, at
      times enjoying independence, at times ruled by Parthian and later Sasanian monarchs. Around
      387 the Roman and Sasanian Empires agreed on a formal partition of Armenia (even though the
      frontier subsequently shifted). Despite the fact that in its formative period Armenian
      Christianity, not unlike Syr. Christianity, was divided over two empires, this did not lead —
      as in the case of the Syrians — to doctrinal division. This is often attributed to a stronger
      sense of ethnic and cultural identity among the Armenians than among the Syrians. In the
      Islamic period Armenians occasionally had their own kingdom, such as under the Bagratid
      dynasty, from the end of the 9th to the middle of the 11th cent. From the late 12th cent. to
      1375, an independent Armenian kingdom existed in Cilicia (‘Little Armenia’), where many
      Armenians had settled. Cilician Armenia accepted union with Rome at the Council of Sis in
      1307, but this union, which failed to receive support outside Cilicia, came to an end with the
      demise of the Cilician kingdom. In the Ottoman Empire, Armenians at first flourished. The
      patriarchate of Constantinople (Istanbul) was created to represent Armenian interests (and
      often other Christians’ interests as well) at the capital. Armenians also lived in parts of
      Persia and Russia, and there were diaspora communities as far as Lemberg (Galicia, present-day
      Lwow in Poland). Significant emigration to Europe and North America started in the middle of
      the 19th  cent. The early 20th cent. saw the Armenian genocide, which largely coincided with
      the <ref type="cr">Sayfo</ref>, and which was followed by further dispersion. The short-lived
      independent Armenian Republic (1918–1920) became part of the Soviet Union in 1920, to regain
      its independence only in September 1991.</p>
     <p>Christianity came to Armenia no later than the 3rd cent. and the Armenian Church was first
      organized by Gregory the Illuminator in the early 4th cent. An important factor in the
      development of Armenian Christianity was the invention of the Armenian script by Maštoc‘
      (Mesrop), traditionally dated in or around 407, and preceded by Maštoc‘’s travels through
      Syria and Edessa. This was followed by a period of intense translation activity, from both
      Greek and Syriac. Prior to the invention of their own script, Armenians used Greek and Syriac
      as their literary and liturgical languages.</p>
     <p>Among the translations of the earliest period (first half of the 5th cent.) are several
      Syriac texts, such as the Demonstrations of <ref type="cr">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, transmitted in
      Armenian under the name of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> (ed. Lafontaine), several
      works by <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>(Armenian: Ephrem Asori ‘the Assyrian’ or ‘Syrian’), and
      a short treatise attributed to bp. <ref type="cr">Aitalaha</ref> of Edessa, which is not
      preserved in Syriac. Ephrem’s Armenian works include the undoubtedly genuine ‘Hymns on
      Nicomedia’, which were written shortly after 358, and of which only a few Syriac fragments
      exist (ed. Renoux), and the Commentary on the <ref type="cr">Diatessaron</ref> (ed. Leloir).
      While for these two works (as well as for Aphrahaṭ) we are dealing with quite faithful
      translations of Syriac originals, the relationship to the Syriac original is more problematic
      for other works attributed to Ephrem, such as a collection of hymns (ed. Mariès and Mercier),
      which seem to contain Syriac materials, but may represent later rewritings, and an
      anti-Marcionite exposition of the Gospel (ed. Egan), which is probably not by Ephrem (see
      Bundy, against the view of the editor), even though a 4th-cent. Syriac original is very
      likely. In addition to the translations of originally Syriac works, some Greek patristic works
      were translated into Armenian not from Greek, but from an earlier Syriac translation. The two
      most well-known examples are <ref type="cr">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref>’s Ecclesiastical
      History and <ref type="cr">Basil of Caesarea</ref>’s Homilies on the Hexaemeron. In the
      earliest layers of Armenian biblical and liturgical texts as well, the mark of Armenia’s early
      contacts with the Syriac world is clearly visible. Among indigenous Armenian authors who are
      well informed about Syriac Christianity and write about it or borrow themes or interpretations
      from it are Eznik of Kołb (author of a work known as either ‘Against the sects’ or ‘On God’),
      Koriwn (author of ‘The Life of Maštoc‘’), the author of the ‘Teaching of Gregory’
      (incorporated into the ‘History of Agathangelos’), and the author of the ‘Epic histories’
      (formerly known as Faustus of Byzantium).</p>
     <p>In the aftermath of the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council’s condemnation of
      Antiochene theo­logy, Armenian Christianity moved away from the Syriac sphere of influence and
      increasingly turned to the Greek imperial church. The Council of Chalcedon (451) at first did
      not have an impact on the Armenians, who at the same time were involved in the Battle of
      Avarayr (the outcome of which led to full Sasanian rule over Armenia). It is only in the
      course of the 6th cent. that church leaders and councils determined Armenia’s own theological
      position, partly in response to missionary activity carried out by representatives of the
      emerging Syr. Mia­physite Church and of the Dyophysite E.-Syr. Church. Even though the
      Armenians repeatedly took a position against dyophysitism, associated with <ref type="cr"
       >Nestorius</ref> as well as with the Ch. of E., a straightforward rejection of the Council of
      Chalcedon only took place at the Council of Dvin in 607. From the 6th-cent. documents of the
      Armenian church (preserved in the ‘Book of Letters’) it appears that, in contrast with the
      Syr. Orth. and Coptic Miaphysite churches, the works of <ref type="cr">Severus of
       Antioch</ref> did not obtain normative status in Armenia, but rather that a form of
      aphthartodocetism gradually became the official doctrine (regarding the body of Christ as
      inherently incorruptible). The question of whether this was associated with <ref type="cr"
       >Julian of Halicarnassus</ref> (whose works seem not to have been translated into Armenian),
      Severus’s opponent, or whether this had different roots and was nourished perhaps by the
      writings of <ref type="cr">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>, some of which were translated into
      Armenian (see Ter-Minassiantz, 147–51, and more recently Cowe), has not yet been fully
      settled. Due to this different orientation within the Miaphysite tradition, there was always
      some distance between the Armenian Orth. and the Syr. Orth. Church, and occasionally some
      tension (Ter-­Minassiantz). A list of historical complaints of the Syrians against the
      Armenians is found in treatises by <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon X bar Shushan</ref> and <ref
       type="cr">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>.</p>
     <p>In spite of the theological complexities in their relationship, contacts and exchanges
      between Syr. and Armenian Christians continued throughout the centuries. In the early Islamic
      period, both the Ch. of E. and the Syr. Orth. Church had a presence in parts of the Armenian
      lands. Since the 8th cent., there was in Khilat (or Akhlat), on the western shore of Lake Van,
      an E.-Syr. metropolitan bp. as well as a Syr. Orth. bp. (Fiey 2003, 1427), while an E.-Syr.
      bp. also is attested for Bardaʿa (Armenian Partaw), on the Terter River (Van Lantschoot 1932).
      The E.-Syr. metropolitan see of Khilat was later given up as an independent see and added to
      Nisibis, whose metropolitan bp. in the 13th cent. had ‘Nisibis and Armenia’ in his title
      (Fiey, <hi rend="italic">Nisibe</hi>, 106). Translation activity from Syriac into Armenian
      went on. For example, some of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>’s exegetical work found
      its way into an Armenian commentary attributed to Ephrem (ed. Mathews), and the 9th-cent.
      Commentary on the Gospel of John by <ref type="cr">Nonos of Nisibis</ref> is preserved only in
      Armenian.</p>
     <p>Intense contacts on all levels took place in the period of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia.
      Many Syrians must have settled in the relative safety of Cilicia, where the Syr. Orth. had bp.
      sees in Adana, Anazarba (ʿAyn Zarba), Sis (patriarchal residence between 1292 and the early
      15th cent.), and Tarsus. There were Syr. Orth. monasteries in Cilicia as well, in particular
      those of Gawikat (or Kawikhat) and Paksimeṭ (or Baksimeṭ). <ref type="cr">Michael Rabo</ref>,
      in his Chronicle, provides a wealth of information on Armenian history; in addition, one of
      the appendices to the Chronicle (no. 5) explicitly deals with the Armenians. Of Michael’s
      Chronicle two different translations were produced, one in 1246, by the Armenian author Vardan
      Arewelc‘i in collaboration with the Edessene monk Yeshuʿ (of Ḥeṣno d-Kifo, see Barsoum), the
      other in 1248 by Vardan alone (possibly after Yeshuʿ’s death). The translation was made from
      Michael’s autograph, which along with other mss. had been transferred from the <ref type="cr"
       >Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref> to Hṙomklay (Qalʿa Rumayta), where the Syr. Orth Patr. Ignatius
      Dawid resided for some time and where a Syr. Orth. church had been built. Both translations
      present a periphrastic and much shortened version of Michael’s Chronicle (Schmidt 1996). Other
      translations from Syriac made in Cilician Armenia include the ‘Syro-Roman Lawbook’ and the
      ‘Sententiae Syriacae’ (see <ref type="cr">Juridical literature</ref>); homilies by <ref
       type="cr">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (Weitenberg, 349 and 350); the Psalm Commentary by <ref
       type="cr">Daniel of Ṣalaḥ</ref>; and several works of medical content. A unique work on
      horse-medicine (written ca. 1300) was translated from Arabic, but the author explicitly
      identifies himself as a veterinary of Syrian descent and creed. Translations typically
      resulted from the collaboration of an Armenian and a Syriac native speaker (Weitenberg, with
      further references). While all the examples quoted here concern Syriac writings translated
      into Armenian, an interesting case of a Syrian author’s interest in Armenian may be seen in
       <ref type="cr">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s biblical commentaries, which in particular in the
      commentary on Psalms contain about 160 quotations of, or references to, the Armenian Bible
      (Göttsberger). The fall of the Cilician kingdom (1375) brought the close contacts between the
      Armenian and Syr. Orth. intellectual elite to an end, even though for the subsequent centuries
      further evidence exists of the ongoing interaction between Syriac and Armenian Christians
      (see, e.g., Kaufhold).</p>
     <p>Among the cities in which Armenians and Syrians lived together for many centuries, Edessa
      assumes a special position. The Armenian presence there can be traced back to a very early
      period and some sources (including Yaʿqub of Edessa, in his Chronicle) present king Abgar and
      the original population of Edessa as Armenian. The story of Abgar’s conversion to Christianity
      became widely popular in Armenian, whereby an increasing Armenization took place, from its
      first attestation in Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History and the 5th-cent. work attributed to
      Labubna, or Łerubna (the Edessene king’s scribe who is also mentioned in the Syr. <ref
       type="cr">Teaching of Addai</ref>) to the rewritten versions in Moses Xorenac‘i’s ‘History of
      the Armenians’ (probably 9th cent.) and the 10th-cent. historians Thomas Arcruni and Uxtanes.
      When the short-lived Crusade principality of Edessa fell to the Seljuks in 1144, the Armenians
      were bewildered as much as the Syr. Christians were (see Dionysios bar Ṣalibi), as is shown by
      the lament written by Nerses Shnorhali (ET van Lint), the later Cath. of all Armenians
      (1166–99), who is known for his friendly relationship with Michael Rabo.</p>
     <p>The contacts between Armenian and Syr. Christians are also reflected in art, as is
      illustrated in the 9th-cent. illuminated Gospel ms. of Queen Mlke (Venice, San Lazzaro 1144),
      which has been connected with the Syriac <ref type="cr">Rabbula Gospels</ref> (Stone et al.).</p>
     <p>For the more recent period (16th–18th cent.) a number of Syriac-Armenian lexica are
      attested, reflecting language contact and bilingualism. Both within these lexica and outside
      of them, interesting examples of boundary crossing between the two langauges are found in
      Armenian texts written in Syriac script and in (at least) one Syriac text written in Armenian
      script (Van Lantschoot 1964, Brock, Schmidt 2007, Takahashi and Weitenberg [forthcoming]).</p>

    <head>Art and architecture</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>A comprehensive study of Syr. Christian art and architecture is still missing, and only a
      few subfields are relatively well covered in overview monographs, such as the architecture of
      Syria west of the Euphrates (Butler; Lassus; Tchalenko), floor mosaics in churches of Syria
      and Lebanon (Donceel-Voûte), manuscript illumination (Leroy 1964), and wall paintings in Syria
      and Lebanon (Cruikshank Dodd; Immerzeel 2009). Given Syr. Christianity’s intertwinement,
      throughout its history, with other linguistic, cultural, and religious traditions, the
      definition of what constitutes ‘Syr. Christian’ art or architecture is somewhat elusive and
      should not be attempted here. In the early period much of Syr. Christianity was situated in
      the Roman Empire, in which there was a great deal of overlap between Syr. Christian and Greek
      Christian art and culture. In the Islamic period certain forms of art were shared between Syr.
      Christians and Muslims. In addition, the proximity of Byzantine Christianity or even Western
      Christianity (esp. in the period of the <ref type="cr">Crusades</ref>) had its impact on
      themes and forms of expressions. There is some evidence in the early Syr. tradition of the use
      of portable icons (the image of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, which was believed to be a
      portrait of Jesus, being the most famous of these), but it is only among the Christians of the
      Chalcedonian traditions (Melkite and Maronite) that the art of icon painting flourished and
      that local styles emerged, such as in the 13th cent. in Tripoli and in the 17th cent. in <ref
       type="cr">Aleppo</ref>. In the other Syr. traditions (Syr. Orth. and Ch. of E.) the cult of
      images in whatever form never became as prominent as it was in the Byzantine tradition, even
      though there is no evidence of any opposition to the use of figurative art, and suggestions
      that Syr. Christianity was somehow connected to the iconoclastic movement within the Byzantine
      tradition or to any other an-iconic tradition should be rejected (Brock 2004; Teule). In
      general, the study of Syr. Christian art and architecture is seriously hampered by the fact
      that the surviving remains are fragmentary and mostly deprived of their original context.
      Accompanying <ref type="cr">inscriptions</ref>, occasionally containing dates and names, may
      provide crucial information. In the present overview only a few areas will be highlighted.</p>
     <label>1. Pre-Christian Edessa</label>
     <p>The art of the semi-independent kingdom of Edessa is accessible to us in a number of
      funerary mosaics, dated or datable to the first three cent. AD (prior to the mid–3rd cent.).
      Some of these show portraits of the deceased, often with their family; others have topics or
      figures from Greco-Roman antiquity, such as the Phoenix or Orpheus playing the lyre.
      Reflecting the life of the urban aristocracy, the mosaics show the proximity of the Parthian
      world, in particular in the costumes (Leroy 1957). Most of the mosaics (some of which are
      dated in their inscriptions) are contemporaneous with the nascent Christian communities in
      Edessa, and with our earliest Christian authors, such as <ref type="cr">Bardaiṣan</ref>, but
      none of them can be identified as specifically Christian (Drijvers and Healey; Healey; Segal).</p>
     <label>2. Christian Architecture in Syria, Ṭur ʿAbdin, and Mesopotamia</label>
     <p>The earliest dated church in the Syr. Christian area is the church of <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub
       of Nisibis</ref>which in a baptistery inscription that survives to the present day is dated
      to 359, i.e. the time when <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>lived in the city. Even though we are
      in the easternmost corner of the Roman Empire and in the heartland of Syr. Christianity, the
      inscription is not in Syriac, but in Greek.</p>
     <p>Most of the evidence for churches between the 4th and 7th cent. is from the region between
       <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>and Aleppo. Known as the ‘Dead cities’, because they were
      abandoned in the early Islamic period due to shifting patterns of economy and trade (and are
      still largely deserted today), numerous sites show the secular and religious buildings of
      villages and medium-size communities. Several churches are impressive, and the architectural
      skeleton of some of them is well-preserved, having been exposed to the forces of nature only,
      not to re-use or destruction by humans. Some churches are very small (such as the
      single-aisled church of Qirqbize). Other churches derive their importance from their role as
      pilgrim destinations, such as the church of Qalbloze, and above all the magnificent church of
       <ref type="cr">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>, which was built in the late 5th cent. and which
      consists of four three-aisled basilicas converging on the saint’s pillar. Even today the
      scattered ruins and the very refined capital sculptures evoke the church’s former majesty.
      Another popular pilgrim destination, which flourished in the 6th cent., is the shrine of Mar
      Sargis (St. Sergius) in Resafa, more eastwards in the Syrian steppe (ca. 160  km. southeast of
      Aleppo).</p>
     <p>The region of <ref type="cr">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> and the wider area around it also preserve
      some of the earliest churches of Syr. Christianity, some of which were expanded throughout the
      centuries and are still in use today. The well-preserved main church of <ref type="cr">Dayr
       al-Zaʿfarān</ref> dates back to the 6th cent., while some of the rebuilding and refurbishment
      of the church of the <ref type="cr">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref> can be dated to the reign
      of the Byzantine emperor Anastasius (r. 491–518). Several other churches in this area go back
      to the early Islamic period, such as the church of Ḥaḥ and the church of the Holy Cross, in
      the monastery of the same name (<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Ṣalīb</ref>).</p>
     <p>A special architectural feature in some of the earliest churches is the bema. This is a
      raised platform, usually horseshoe-shaped and with low walls, which is located in the middle
      of the nave and on which the liturgy of the Word was performed. The above-mentioned churches
      of Qirqbize, Qalbloze, and Resafa provide interesting examples, while detached pieces of the
      bema construction have found their way to modern museums, such as the stone bema lectern of
      Bennawi, which is presently shown in the garden of the National Museum of <ref type="cr"
       >Damascus</ref> (Brock and Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Hidden Pearl</hi>, vol. 2, 43). In
      recent years the bema has received considerable attention, both from liturgists and
      archeologists (Cassis, Loosley, Renhart, and Taft).</p>
     <p>Several other detached pieces of church decoration, chancel panels, or door lintels,
      exhibiting ornamental motifs or iconographical themes, are found scattered all over the world.
      Two chancel panels in stone, uncovered at Rasm al-Qanafez (to the east of Salamiyya, Syria)
      and presently in the National Museum of Damascus, show Daniel among the lions and the three
      Magi approaching the Virgin with Child (<hi rend="italic">Syrie</hi>, 358–59; Peña, 84).</p>
     <p>Floor mosaics as well often have left their original location. Most of the mosaics belonging
      to churches in Syria and Lebanon have conveniently been brought together by P. Donceel-Voûte,
      with the ‘Adam mosaic’ in the Michaelion of Huarte (ca. 15 km. north-northeast of <ref
       type="cr">Apamea</ref>) as one of the highlights (Donceel-Voûte, 105), to be compared with
      the royal Adam shown on a mosaic panel in the Museum of Ḥama, the latter with a Greek and
      Syriac caption (ibid., 113; also in Brock and Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Hidden Pearl</hi>,
      vol. 2, 41). More recently beautiful mosaics have been uncovered at Tall Biʿa, near
      Raqqaʿ/Kallinikos, in the church of a monastery that may have been the Monastery of Mar
      Zakkay, to which <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon of Tella</ref> once belonged (Kalla, with further
      references).</p>
     <p>While by far the largest part of our evidence for the early period belongs to the W.-Syr.
      tradition (in particular Syr. Orth. and Melkite), there has been in recent years considerable
      and promising archeological activity in the geographical area of the Ch. of E. (Hauser;
      Kröger, with further references). The Christian monuments of Iraq (belonging to either the Ch.
      of E. or the Syr. Orth. tradition), a number of which go back to the first millennium, have
      been surveyed by Fiey in his three-volume publication <hi rend="italic">Assyrie
       chrétienne</hi>, while the same scholar devoted a separate volume to <ref type="cr"
       >Mosul</ref> (1959). Sites of particular significance are the city of <ref type="cr"
       >Tagrit</ref> (Harrak 2001), <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> and <ref type="cr">Dayro
       d-Mor Behnam</ref> (nowadays Syr. Cath.), with its exceptional 13th-cent. carvings on the
      main entrance door. There is also some evidence of building activity associated with the Ch.
      of E. in the Holy Land, in particular a hermitage near Jericho (Fiey 1983, and Brock and
      Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Hidden Pearl</hi>, vol. 2, 46) and possibly a monastic complex at
      Tel Masos, in the northern Negev (Fritz and Maiberger).</p>
     <label>3. Manuscript Illumination</label>
     <p>An excellent survey of illuminated mss. kept in Western and Middle-Eastern libraries, with
      detailed analysis, is available in Leroy 1964. The most significant set of early illuminations
      is found in the opening quire of the 6th-cent. ms. that contains the <ref type="cr">Rabbula
       Gospels</ref> (named after the scribe of the Gospel text), with its richly decorated canon
      tables and its full-page illuminations. Of the same period, or possibly slightly later, is the
      so-called ‘Syriac Bible from Paris’ (Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 341), which contains mostly OT
      themes and figures (Sörries). The art of ms. illumination came to full fruition in the 11th to
      13th cent.: along with biblical mss., such as the ‘Buchanan Bible’ (ms. Cambridge, Univ. Libr.
      Oo.I.1,2; on which, see Hunt), there are a number of lectionaries, most of them belonging to
      the Syr. Orth. tradition. The number of E.-Syr. illuminated mss. is very limited (for some
      15th-cent. examples, see Leroy, 417–18 and 393–403; Brock and Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Hidden
       Pearl</hi>, vol.<hi rend="italic"></hi>2, 237–38). In the 16th cent. the tradition of ms.
      illumination was given new life among the Chaldeans (see e.g. ms. Borgia Syr. 169, Leroy,
      404–8). For more recent studies, esp. on the Syr. Orth. mss. of the 11th–13th cent., see e.g.
      Doumato. It should also be noted that ms. illumination is not limited to the mss. of the
      mainstream ecclesiastical traditions, but is also found, e.g., in magic mss.
      (Balicka-Witakowska 2008).</p>
     <label>4. Wall Paintings</label>
     <p>Most of the late antique churches must have contained painting, either of a purely
      ornamental nature or intended to provide instruction or to impart devotion. Remains of
      painting can be found on some of the ruins, but no full Christian wall paintings from the
      first millennium have survived. The <ref type="cr">wall paintings in Syria and Lebanon</ref>
      deserve separate attention, with those of <ref type="cr">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>, <ref
       type="cr">Qara</ref>, and the Lebanese Qadisha Valley as unmistakable highlights. Most of
      these belong to the period between the 11th and 13th century. To the same period in all
      likelihood belongs a newly discovered wall painting in the church of Mar Gewargis in <ref
       type="cr">Qaraqosh</ref>, near Mosul, representing the Baptism of Jesus (Snelders 2007). The
      art of wall painting continued well into the modern area. Interesting 18th-cent. examples are
      found in the Syr. Orth. church of Sergius and Bacchus in Ṣadad, ca. 100 km. north east of
      Damascus (Brock and Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Hidden Pearl</hi>, vol. 2, 147–50).</p>
     <p>In addition to the heartlands of Syr. Christianity, wall paintings reflecting Syriac
      Christianity may be found in <ref type="cr">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in Egypt, which from the
      early 9th cent. onwards had a mixed Coptic and Syriac monastic population. While the earliest
      paintings in the main Church of the monastery predate the arrival of Syr. monks, some of the
      later paintings must reflect the interests and taste of the Syr. monks. This may be the case
      for the probably 10th-cent. painting of the Three Patriarchs (Innemée 1998), and even more so
      for the very fragmentarily preserved paintings of Emperor Constantine and King Abgar (holding
      the <hi rend="italic">mandylion</hi>), both of which are accompanied by Syriac inscriptions
      and may also belong to the 10th  cent. (Innemée and Van Rompay). Fully preserved paintings in
      three half-domes of the church, with Syriac inscriptions, belong to the early 13th cent.
      (Leroy 1982).</p>
     <label>5. Liturgical Vessels and Accessories</label>
     <p>A large number of 5th- or 6th-cent. liturgical objects from Syria have been uncovered in the
      course of the 20th cent., in the area south-west of Aleppo (Mundell Mango). In some cases
      inscriptions provide information on the date and on the church to which the objects belonged:
      Kaper Koraon (the exact location of which is uncertain) and Beth Misona (three chalices and a
      paten, now in the Cleveland Museum of Art). While the link with Syriac Christianity seems to
      be obvious, the inscriptions are in Greek, not in Syriac. A  rare Syriac inscribed silver dish
      from the 6th cent., in the collection of the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, has been made
      popular among Syr. scholars by R. Murray’s <hi rend="italic">Symbols of Church and
       Kingdom</hi> (1975 and 2004). It represents the Ascension, the women at the tomb, and the
      Crucifixion, along with soldiers, Peter and the cock, and Daniel in the lions’ den.</p>
     <p>To a slightly later period, perhaps 8th or 9th cent., belongs a very well preserved bronze
      incense burner uncovered in Takrit (now in the National Museum of Baghdad); it has nine scenes
      from the life of Jesus (Harrak 2006), but no inscriptions.</p>
     <p>From the early 13th-cent. a bronze liturgical fan is preserved (<hi rend="italic"
       >marwḥā</hi> or <hi rend="italic">marwaḥtā</hi>, ‘flabellum’), now housed in the Belgian
      Museum of Mariemont. The Syr. inscription reports that it was made in 1202/3 for Dayr
      al-Suryān in Egypt; it may have been produced in a workshop in the Mosul area (Snelders and
      Immerzeel). To the same period belongs the church treasure of Resafa, which includes a
      skillfully decorated silver chalice and a paten, both bearing inscriptions in Syriac (even
      though the objects may have been of Western origin or inspiration). The paten was a gift to
      the church of St. Sergius at Resafa by Ḥasnon of Edessa. These objects had probably been
      buried in order to be saved from the Mongol invasions of 1259/60 (Ulbert; Brock and Taylor,
       <hi rend="italic">Hidden Pearl</hi>, vol. 2, 212).</p>
     <label>6. Liturgical Vestments</label>
     <p>While some information on liturgical vestments may be extracted from literary sources and
      from depictions in ms. illuminations and wall paintings, a rare piece, presently housed in the
      New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, has recently been studied: a bishop’s stole (<hi
       rend="italic">batrashil), bearing inscriptions in Syriac and Arabic. It was made for Bp.
     </hi>Athanasius Abraham Yaghmur of Nabk in 1534–35 (Ball).</p>
     <label>7. Syr. Christian Art in the 21st Century</label>
     <p>While the precious remains of ancient Syr. Christian art and architecture nowadays are
      receiving more attention from Syr. scholars and Syr. Christians alike, Syr. Christians at the
      same time are creating their own art forms, often inspired by the treasures of the past, to
      which they add new layers of interpretation and meaning according to their present-day
      situation. Churches are being renovated or new churches are being built in the Middle East, in
      India, and in the worldwide <ref type="cr">Diaspora</ref>. In many of these churches the
      ancient art of wall painting is brought to new life, while present-day liturgical publications
      often reflect the illuminated manuscripts of the past (for the Maronite tradition, see e.g.
      Badwi).</p>
     <p>See Fig. 1, 9–15, 62, 63, 64, 65, 71c, 77c, 80, 86, 88c, 101, 104c, 112, 115, and
      116–118.</p>

     <p>Maronite polymath, Custodian of the Vatican Library, and titular bp. of Tyre. Born at
      Hasrun, he was educated from an early age at the Maronite College in Rome. From 1715–7 he
      travelled in the Middle East, collecting mss., including many from <ref type="cr">Dayr
       al-Suryān</ref> in the Nitrian Desert. In 1739 he was appointed First Custodian of the
      Vatican Library, a post he held until his death. It was on the basis of the Syriac mss., in
      large part from Dayr al-Suryān, that he compiled his monumental <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
       Orientalis Clementino-Vaticana</hi>, in four volumes (1719–28; repr. 1975, with ‘Postface’ by
      J.-M. Sauget; and 2002). This was effectively the first European history of Syriac literature,
      and it remains an important resource even today, thanks to the many extensive excerpts of
      Syriac texts. The volumes are arranged as follows: I, Orthodox (i.e. Chalcedonian) authors;
      II, Syrian Orthodox writers; III.1, literature of the Church of the East, and III.2, history
      of the Church of the East. (III.1, 3–362 contains an annotated edition of the verse catalogue
      of Syriac authors by <ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>). The three-volume Catalogue of the Hebrew
      and Syriac mss. in the Vatican Library was also compiled by him in conjunction with Stephanus
      Evodius (1756–9; the Syriac mss. are described in vols. 2–3). He was also the editor of the
      three volumes of Greek texts attributed to <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref> (1732, 1743, 1746; the
      three Syriac volumes were edited by <ref type="cr">P. Mubārak</ref>/Benedictus). A list of his
      extensive published literary output was drawn up by A. Mai, in <hi rend="italic">Scriptorum
       Veterum Nova Collectio III.2</hi> (1828), 165–68; this includes the many works left
      unpublished, or unfinished at his death (he had planned several further volumes of the <hi
       rend="italic">Bibliotheca Orientalis</hi>); some of these were published posthumously (e.g.
      his monograph on the Patriarchs of <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, 1881), while others perished
      in a fire several months after his death. Ms. Vat. Syr. 389 is an autograph Syriac grammar
      (1707). He also played a central role in the Synod of Mount Lebanon (1736).</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Scholar of the Christian East, professor at the University of Munich. Assfalg was born in
      Hohenaschau, Bavaria, on 6 Nov. 1919 and studied philosophy, theo­logy, and Near-Eastern
      languages (Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac) in Freising and Eichstätt. He served in the German army
      during World War II and became a prisoner of war in France. In 1946, he continued his studies
      at the University of Munich, where he specialized in the field of Eastern Christian studies,
      in particular under the guidance of W. Hengstenberg (philology of the Christian East) and A.
      Spitaler (Semitic languages). He earned his doctoral degree in 1950 with a dissertation on
      ‘The Order of the Priesthood’, an Arabic liturgical manual of the Coptic Church, and his
      ‘Habilitation’ in 1961 with an edition of the Old Georgian text of the Minor Prophets.
      Well-versed in all the languages of the Christian East, he taught at the University of Munich
      from 1963 and continued to do so, even after his official retirement in 1985. He died on 12
      Jan. 2001 in Munich.</p>
     <p>Among his Syriac publications, the catalogue of Syriac mss. in Germany (1963) should be
      singled out. Together with P. Krüger he co-edited the <hi rend="italic">Kleines Wörterbuch des
       Christlichen Orients</hi> (1975), which was subsequently translated (with minor updates) into
      French (1991) and Polish (1998). His name is also closely associated with the journal <hi
       rend="italic">Oriens Christianus</hi>, of which he was co-editor from 1965 until his death.
      For his 70th birthday, a <hi rend="italic">Festschrift</hi> was presented to him (1979), which
      includes several contributions in the field of Syriac.</p>

    <head>Assyrians</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>In pre-modern sources, Assyrians (<hi rend="italic">Atorāye</hi>) were inhabitants of the
      area or ecclesiastical province of Ator, around <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>. In modern times,
      however, the name has taken on two expanded senses: to denote 1. the whole ethnic group
      historically represented by the Ch. of E.; and sometimes 2. the supposed ethnic group
      represented by all the Syriac churches.</p>
     <p>1. In medieval sources there are isolated references that connect Syr. Christians with the
      ancient Assyrians, but this identification was not developed until the 19th  cent. A. H.
      Layard identified the Christians he met as descendants of the ancient Assyrians whose
      buildings he was excavating (<hi rend="italic">Nineveh and its Remains</hi>, vol. 2<hi
       rend="italic"></hi>[1848], 237). Since the area around Mosul had been called ‘Assyria’ from
      ancient times, this identification was not unnatural. It was a further development, however,
      when Anglicans (probably first G. P. Badger), seeking to avoid the word ‘Nestorian’, began to
      use the name ‘Assyrian Christians’ for the whole Church of the East. This usage was made
      official by the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission to the Assyrian Christians (1886) —
      although the missionaries did not use the word once they were in the field. The general
      adoption of ‘Assyrian’ and the Assyrian ethnology by the people themselves came after 1900
      under the influence of nationalist writers like Freydon Atoraya. It was further encouraged
      when the founding of the present state of Syria made it more urgent to find an ethnic name
      other than ‘Syrian’. A  popular etymology had it that <hi rend="italic">Surāyā</hi> (a variant
      of <hi rend="italic">Suryāyā</hi>, ‘Syrian’) was a corruption of <hi rend="italic"
       >Asurāyā</hi> (even though correctly ‘Assyrian’ is <hi rend="italic">Atorāyā</hi>). Whatever
      its background, the name ‘Assyrian’ has proved convenient and is now generally used even by
      those who do not accept the connection with ancient Assyria. The Church of the East, although
      it has not especially promoted this connection, is officially styled ‘Church of the East of
      the Assyrians’ or ‘Assyrian Church of the East’. Among Chaldean Catholics, ‘Assyrian’ has had
      to compete with ‘Chaldean’ as the preferred ethnic name. Some have adopted ‘Assyro-Chaldean’
      as a compromise.</p>
     <p>2. The name ‘Assyrian’ was already in use in some W.-Syr. circles before World War I. It was
      popularized in the USA by writers like <ref type="cr">Naʿʿūm Fāʾiq</ref>, and <ref type="cr"
       >D. B. Perley</ref> who insisted that the different Syriac churches, eastern and western,
      were accidental divisions within a single nation. (From this period dates the adoption of
      ‘Assyrian’ into the names of some American Syr. Orth. parishes, who retain it today although
      without the accompanying nationalist agenda.) The Syr. Orth. hierarchy has generally opposed
      the name ‘Assyrian’, and writers within the Church emphasize its Aramean heritage over against
      any alleged Assyrian one.</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Long-serving Patr. of the Syr. Orth. Church in the late 6th and early 7th cent. His
      consecration is commonly dated to 594 or 595, but there is confusion in the ­sources as to the
      exact date: medieval and modern authors have also suggested 587, 597, and 603 as
      possibilities. All sources agree that Athanasios died in 631 and one gives 28 July as the
      precise day (<hi rend="italic">Chronica Minora</hi>, vol. 2, ed. E. W. Brooks, p. 144).</p>
     <p>Athanasios was ordained Patr. against his will. Afterwards, his bishops agreed to allow him
      to return to his monastery for a year to complete the task which had been assigned him there:
      tending camels. When the bishops came to collect Athanasios a year later, they found him
      working in a mud pit, helping to patch up a camel stable. This association with camels earned
      him the epithet <hi rend="italic">Gamolo</hi> ‘Camel Driver.’</p>
     <p>Athanasios’s patriarchate spanned a tumultuous period in the history of the Near East: the
      Byzantine-Persian wars of the early 7th cent. Most of Athanasios’s actions recorded in
      historical sources relate to his confronting the implications for the church of changing
      political orders; in the course of his service he dealt either directly or indirectly with
      both Byzantine and Persian rulers.</p>
     <p>Athanasios is credited with reorganizing the structure of the Syr. Orth. Church in the
      Persian Empire. He appointed bishops there and gave <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>
      primacy over all other monasteries in the Persian Empire.</p>
     <p>In perhaps 629–30, Athanasios, along with twelve bishops, met with the Emperor Heraclius for
      twelve days in Mabbug and held theological discussions. When they ultimately refused to accept
      the Council of Chalcedon, Heraclius became enraged and unleashed a persecution on Miaphysites
      throughout the Empire.</p>
     <p>In either 610 or 616, Athanasios and Anastasius, the Miaphysite Patr. of Alexandria, ended
      the Tritheist Schism which had divided the two churches since the late 6th-cent. dispute
      between Damian and <ref type="cr">Peter of Kallinikos</ref>.</p>
     <p>The ‘Conflict of Severus’ (PO 4 and PO 49.4), which exists in Coptic fragments as well as in
      Arabic and Ethiopic, is the only stand-alone work of Athanasios which survives. His other
      extant works are all to be found embedded in the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Michael
       Rabo</ref>. They include: a letter of Athanasios to Quryaqos of <ref type="cr">Amid</ref>
      (vol. 2, 381–94; vol. 4, 392–9); the synodicon established by Athanasios and Anastasios, Patr.
      of Alex­andria, ending the Tritheist schism (vol.  2, 381–93; vol. 4, 392–9); an encyclical of
      Athanasios to the bps. of the East (vol.  2, 394–9; vol. 4, 400–2); a <hi rend="italic"
       >libellus</hi> of Athanasios to Heraclius (vol. 2, 405–8; vol. 4, 404–8); and a letter to the
      Monks of Mor Matay (vol. 2, 414–7; vol.  4, 411–3).</p>
     <p>After his death in 631, Athanasios was succeeded as Patr. by his synkellos, <ref type="cr"

      Christians who attend pagan feasts and eat the meat of pagan sacrifices. A later scribe added
      an incipit claiming that the letter refers to the sacrifices of Hagarenes. Athanasios died in
      September of 687 and was succeeded by Yulyanos Rumoyo.</p>
     <p>Throughout his life Athanasios was an avid translator of Greek philosophical works and
      patristic authors. Several of his translations still survive. These include a translation of
       <ref type="cr">Porphyry</ref>’s Isagoge that Athanasios completed in 645 (ms. Vat. Syr. 158),
      the translation of an anonymous Greek introduction to logic (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add.

      and Daniel the Bp. of <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref> (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,181; ed.

      Amid. Athanasios died in 1741; it is said that healing miracles took place on his tomb. He was
      a skilful scribe.</p>

     <p>Bp. of Alexandria and Greek author. He became bp. of Alexandria in 328, but spent much of
      his life in exile due to his vigorous opposition to Arianism. Many of his numerous writings
      (in Greek) were translated into Syriac, and some of these survive in several recensions. Most
      of Athanasius’s works in Syriac are only known from early Syr. Orth. or Melkite mss. (in some
      cases there have been some dogmatic alterations). <ref type="cr">Timo­theos  I</ref>, however,
      in his Letters knew of several works, and the Letter to Epictetus is quoted in both E.- and
      W.-Syr. dogmatic florilegia. The only work transmitted in a large number of mss. is the Life
      of Antony, which was later incorporated into <ref type="cr">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>’s ‘Paradise of
      the Fathers’. The following are the most important translations which have so far been edited:</p>
     <p>1. ‘On the Incarnation’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2091), ed. with ET, R. W. Thomson, <hi
       rend="italic">Athanasiana Syriaca</hi>, vol. 1 (CSCO 257–8; 1965). This represents the short

      vol. 5, and E. A. W. Budge in <hi rend="italic">Paradise of the Fathers</hi> (1904).
      Dra­guet’s view that the very free translation represents a lost earlier form of the Greek
      text is now dis­counted.</p>

     <p>A number of writings claiming to be by Athanasius were put out under his name by

     <p>Bp., lexicographer, and translator into Syriac. He was born in <ref type="cr">Alqosh</ref>
      of Qasha Hirmiz bar Michael who was the brother of Patr. Yawsep Audo. Audo’s brother Israel
      Audo became the bp. of <ref type="cr">Mardin</ref>. After completing his elementary studies in
      Alqosh, his uncle the patr. took him to Rome where Audo joined the college of Congregatio de

      He later served as patriarchal vicar to <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref> in 1882 for four years,
      after which he returned to Mosul to take charge of the <ref type="cr">Seminary of St.

    <head>Awgen, Mar</head>
    <div type="infobox">
     <ab>(fl. 4th – early 5th cent.)</ab>
   </div>
    <div type="body">
     <p>Mar Awgen is the traditional founder of monasticism in Mesopotamia. The two primary sources
      for his life are an anonymous ‘Life of Mar Awgen’ and a brief account preserved in the ‘Book
      of Chastity’, composed by <ref type="cr">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>of Baṣra (9th cent.). He receives an
      earlier mention in <ref type="cr">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref>, in the 7th cent. Mar Awgen was an
      Egyptian, born in the time of Constantine. He worked for twenty-five years as a pearl diver,
      but then left this occupation to join the nascent monastic movement, and he became a disciple
      of Pachomius, the famous Egyptian monastic leader. After spending some time in the monastery
      of Pachomius, Mar Awgen travelled to <ref type="cr">Nisibis</ref> and founded a monastery on
      nearby Mt. Izla. His seventy disciples who followed him from Egypt were the reputed founders
      of other monasteries in various parts of Mesopotamia and other Syriac-speaking lands. Mar
      Awgen himself is said to have performed numerous miracles in the presence of Shapur, the King
      of Persia. It has also been reported that his remains and those of certain of his disciples
      were brought to the Monastery of Mar Ḥananya (<ref type="cr">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>). Mar
      Awgen is held in the highest esteem in all the eastern churches with Syriac roots.</p>
     <p>Scholars have now shown that this traditional account does not have a firm historical
      foundation and has served primarily to obfuscate the native origins of Syro-Mesopotamian
      monasticism in favor of reputed Egypt­ian origins. These accounts of Mar Awgen have been shown
      to be of late origin, anachronistic, and extremely divergent on important details, e.g. the
      number of his disciples ranges from eighteen to seventy, and a number of monks named in these
      accounts actually lived as late as the 7th and even 10th cent. Attempts to connect Mar Awgen
      to the Aōnes mentioned in Sozomen’s Ecclesiastical History (VI.33) have failed, and it is even
      possible, as some scholars have surmised, that there was, in fact, no such historical person
      as Mar Awgen.</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Theologian and monastic author. The main sources for Babai’s life are <ref type="cr"
       >Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>’s ‘Book of Chastity’ (chap.  39), <ref type="cr">Toma of Marga</ref>’s ‘Book
      of Superiors’ (I, ch. 27 and 29), and the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>(chap. 84).
      Born in Beth ʿAynatha (in Beth Zabdai), he studied at the <ref type="cr">School of
       Nisibis</ref> under <ref type="cr">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref>. He subsequently became a
      monk of the ‘Great Monastery’, founded in 571 by <ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref> (d.
      588). Later, he moved to Beth Zabdai to found his own monastery there, but in 604 he returned
      to the Great Monastery, where he had been appointed Abbot, in succession to Dadishoʿ. During
      the interregnum (609–28) following the death of the Cath. <ref type="cr">Grigor</ref>, the Ch.
      of E. was administered jointly by the Archdeacon and Babai, the latter having the title
      ‘Visitor of the monasteries’. He died shortly after the death of Khusrau II (628), who had not
      allowed the appointment of a successor to Grigor.</p>
     <p>Babai’s writings cover four main topics:</p>
     <p>1. Christology. His ‘Book of the Union, on the divinity and humanity (of Christ) and on the
      prosopon of the union’, remains a fundamental statement of the Christology of the Church to
      this day. It is composed in seven books, of which the seventh may originally have belonged to
      another work. The ‘Book of the Union’ was edited (with LT) by A. Vaschalde (CSCO 79–80; 1915);
      there is an unpublished ET by M. Birnie. In the same volume of the CSCO there is also a short
      treatise ‘Against those who say “Just as the body and soul are one <hi rend="italic"
       >qnomā</hi>, so too God the Word and the Man are one <hi rend="italic">qnomā</hi>” ’. An
      excerpt arguing that ‘two natures’ (in the incarnate Christ) implies ‘two <hi rend="italic"
       >qnome</hi>’ features in a late collection of Christological texts (ed. with ET by L.
      Abramowski and A. Goodman, <hi rend="italic">Nestorian Christological Texts</hi> [1972], vol.
      1, 207–9 [Syr.], vol. 2, 123–5 [ET]).</p>
     <p>2. Monastic topics. Of great significance, for its learning as well as for its length, is
      his Commentary on <ref type="cr">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>’s ‘Gnostic Chapters’ (ed. with GT by
      Frankenberg, 1912). Babai also wrote a Commentary on <ref type="cr">Mark the Monk</ref>’s
      ‘Spiritual Law’ (unpublished; study by G. Krüger, in <hi rend="italic">OC</hi> 44 [1960],
      46–74). A collection of short ‘Useful Counsels on the Ascetic Life’ are also unpublished, but
      there is an ET by G. Chediath, <hi rend="italic">Babai the Great. Some Useful Counsels on the
       Ascetic Life</hi> (Moran Etho 15; 2001). Babai wrote a set of Rules for monks, preserved only
      in Arabic translation (ed. with ET, <ref type="cr">A. Vööbus</ref>, <hi rend="italic">Syriac
       and</hi>
      <hi rend="italic">Arabic Documents regarding Legislation relative to Syrian Asceticism</hi>
      [1960], 176–84).</p>
     <p>3. Hagiography. In his Life of Gewargis (ed. <ref type="cr">P. Bedjan</ref>, <hi
       rend="italic">Histoire de Mar Jabalaha, de trois autres patriarches, d’un prêtre et deux
       laiques, nestoriens</hi> [1895; repr. 2007], 424–8) Babai gives a list of his hagiographical
      works, but of these only the Life of Mihramgushnasp/Gewargis (martyred in 615) survives in
      full (ed. Bedjan, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de Mar Jabalaha,</hi>416–571; GT by G. Hoffmann,
      1880). Unfortunately the only ms. of a woman martyr, Christina, breaks off soon after the
      beginning (ed. Bedjan, <hi rend="italic">Acta Martyrum et Sanctorum</hi>, vol. 4, 201–7).</p>
     <p>4. Liturgy. Two <hi rend="italic">tešbḥātā</hi> (‘Our Father who is in heaven, holy is his
      nature...’ and ‘Blessed is the Compassionate One who in his grace...’) are specifically
      attributed to him (though some mss. have a different attribution); the first of these also
      features in the Maronite <hi rend="italic">Šḥimto</hi> (Thurs. <hi rend="italic">Lilyo</hi>).
      A Hymn for the Commemoration of the Greek Doctors is also attributed to him (ms. Cambridge
      Add. 1980, f. 210r; not found in T. Darmo’s edition of the <hi rend="italic">ḥudrā</hi>).</p>
     <p>5. Parts of a work on the monastic life are preserved in a ms. (M20N) of the ‘New Finds’ at
      the <ref type="cr">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref>, Mount Sinai.</p>
     <p>A large number of other works by Babai have not survived (<ref type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>
      states that he wrote ‘83 volumes’ in all).</p>

    <head>Baghdad</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>City on the Tigris, approximately 35 km. north of <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>.
      The seat of the Ch. of E. Cath. under the Abbasids and the seat today of the Chald. Patr. and
      Ancient Ch. of E. Patr. ‘Baghdad’, whose etymology is disputed, was originally the name of one
      of the villages that stood on the site of the city founded by the second Abbasid caliph
      al-Manṣūr under the name of Madīnat al-Salām ‘City of Peace’ in 762. Later Syriac authors
      often call the city ‘Babel’, i.e. Babylon. From 762 until 1258, when it was taken by Hulagu
      (except in 836–92, when the caliphs resided in Sāmarrāʾ), Baghdad was the seat of the Abbasid
      caliphate, and in the first half of that period was among the most prosperous and culturally
      advanced cities in the world. Capital of a province corresponding largely to the central part
      of today’s Iraq under the Ottomans (1534–1623, 1638–1918), Baghdad became the capital of the
      newly formed state of Iraq in 1921.</p>
     <p>The first Ch. of E. Cath. to spend time in Baghdad was Yaʿqob II (753–73), namely in a
      prison there, an experience shared by the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref type="cr">Giwargis</ref> I
      (759–90) and the Melk. Patr. Theodoros (751–97). Cath. <ref type="cr">Ḥenanisho</ref>ʿ <ref
       type="cr">II</ref> (773–80), though elected in the Monastery of Mar Petion in Baghdad,
      continued to reside in Seleucia-Ctesiphon. With <ref type="cr">Timotheos I</ref> (780–823) the
      Catholicoi begin to reside permanently in Baghdad. Major groups of Christians who settled in
      the city came from earlier E. Syr. centers at <ref type="cr">Ḥirta</ref>, Kashkar (al-Wāsiṭ),
      and <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>. W.-Syr. Christians also had a significant presence in
      Baghdad by the end of the 8th cent. Beginning with Timotheos I himself, in the period down to
      the middle of the 11th cent., Syr. Christian scholars played a vital role in the intellectual
      life of Baghdad, especially as physicians and as translators of Greek philosophical and
      scientific works into Arabic — scholars such as <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873),
      Abū Bishr Mattā b. Yūnus (d. 940), <ref type="cr">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (893–974), and <ref
       type="cr">Abū al-Faraj ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043), to name but a few (see <ref type="cr"
       >medicine</ref> and <ref type="cr">Greek, Syriac translations from</ref>). Though not subject
      to official persecutions as occurred earlier under the Sasanians, the Christians in Baghdad
      were subject to certain discriminations and were vulnerable to attacks by the populace,
      especially at times of instability under weak governments, which was often the case from the
      middle of the 10th cent. onwards.</p>
     <p>The residences of the Catholicoi generally followed the movement of the political and
      commercial center of the city. In the first period, they resided on the right bank of the
      Tigris, in the Monastery of Klil Ishoʿ (also called Dayr al-Jāthalīq ‘Monastery of the
      Catholicos’) to the south of the ‘Round City’, where most of the Catholicoi from Timotheos I
      to Sargis I (860–72) were buried, and in the Monastery of Mar Petion (Dayr al-ʿAtīqa) in the
      former village of Sūrāyā (al-ʿAtīqa) to the east of the Round City, which predated the
      foundation of Madīnat al-Salām and was restored by Sabrishoʿ II (831–35). Yoḥannan II (884–91)
      was the first Catholicos to establish his residence on the left bank, in the Shammāsiyya
      Quarter in the northern part of the walled city of that period. Most of the Catholicoi from
      Yoḥannan III (893–899) to Eliya II (1111–32) resided there and were buried in the ‘Palace of
      the Greeks’ (Dār al-Rūm). Barṣawma  I (1134–36) moved his residence south to the Church of Mar
      Sabrishoʿ in Sūq al-Thalātha, and Yahbalaha II (1190–1222) to the Church of St. Mary in the
      Karkh Quarter on the west bank. After the fall of Baghdad to the initially pro-Christian
      Mongols, Makkika  II (1257–65) was given a group of buildings centered around the mansion of a
      former vizier on the Tigris as his residence, but his successor Denḥa I (1265–81) was forced
      to withdraw to <ref type="cr">Arbela</ref> by Muslim reactions against Mongol rule in the
      city. <ref type="cr">Yahbalaha III</ref> (1281–1317), <ref type="cr">Timotheos II</ref>
      (1318–32) and, probably, Denḥa II (mid-14th cent.) were still consecrated in Baghdad, but
      normally resided away from Baghdad in northern Iraq and (today’s Iranian) Azerbaijan.</p>
     <p>Ḥabib, the first known Syr. Orth. bp. of Baghdad, is attested in 818. Among the churches
      belonging to the Syr. Orth. community in Baghdad was that of Mār Tūmā, the burial place of
      Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī, in the Christian quarter (Qaṭīʿat al-Naṣārā) to the south of the Round City.
      Ch. of E. Cath. Yoḥannan V (1000–11) succeeded in obtaining a decree from the caliph
      forbidding the long-term residence of Syr. Orth. maphrians in Baghdad during a visit to the
      city by Maph. Ignatius bar Qiqi (991–1016) in 1003/4. Nevertheless, <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon bar
       Maʿdani</ref> (Maphr. 1232–53, Patr. 1253–63) was later able to spend several years of his
      maphrianate in Baghdad, devoting part of that time to the study of Arabic literature. The last
      pre-modern Syr. Orth. bp. of Baghdad was Timotheos Yeshuʿ, ordained there by <ref type="cr"
       >Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> in 1265.</p>
     <p>Little is heard of the Christians in Baghdad after the sack of the city by Timur in 1401,
      and it is only in the 17th cent. that we have evidence again of the presence of Christians in
      any significant numbers. From the middle of the 19th cent., the Chald. patriarchs (bearing the
      title ‘of Babylon’), though normally resident in <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>, often visited
      Baghdad. Two of them, Yoḥannan  VIII Hormizd (1830–38) and ʿAbdishoʿ V Khayyāṭ (1895–99), died
      and were buried in Baghdad. The Chald. patriarchate was transferred from Mosul to Baghdad de
      facto under Yawsep VII Ghanīma (1947–58) and officially under Pawlos   II Cheikho (1958–89).
      The Ch. of E. Patr. Shemʿon XX Pawlos (1918–20), who died as a refugee in Baʿqūba, was
      interred in Baghdad. The Ch. of E. has had a bishop in Baghdad since 1951. Baghdad has been
      the seat of the patriarchs of the Ancient Church of the East since 1968, when <ref type="cr"
       >Toma Darmo</ref> (d.  1969) was elected patriarch there by those opposed to the introduction
      of the Gregorian calendar in the Ch. of E. The Syr. Catholic Church has had a bp. resident in
      Baghdad since 1862. The new Syr. Orth. see of Baghdad and Baṣra was erected in 1960, and has
      had the scholar Būlus Behnām (metr. 1962–69) and the future patriarch Severus (later Ignatius)
      Zakkā ʿIwāṣ (metr. 1969–80, Patr. 1980–) as its occupants.</p>
     <p>There are around fifty churches of various denominations in the city today (including 24
      Chald., 7 Syr. Orth., 4 Ch. of E., 3 Syr. Catholic, and 2 Ancient Ch. of E. in regular use,
      according to S. Rassam, <hi rend="italic">Christianity in Iraq</hi>, 2005). The oldest is that
      of Virgin Mary on al-Maydān Square near the northern end of the Ottoman city area, built in
      1639 and now in Armenian Orthodox hands. A number of churches were founded in the 19th  cent.
      in the area that came to be called ʿAqd al-Naṣārā nearer the center of the old city, including
      the Chald. Church of Mary Mother of Sorrows (Umm al-Aḥzān; place of burial of Patr. Yoḥannan
      VIII, ʿAbdishoʿ V, and Pawlos II) and the former Syr. Cath. cathedral, as well as the Latin
      church now used by the Coptic Orthodox. Many of the newer representative churches are found in
      the area to the southeast of the city center, including the new Syr. Cath. Cathedral of Our
      Lady of Deliverance/Sayyidat al-Najāt (1968, commonly called Umm al-Ṭāq) and the Chald. Church
      of St. Joseph (Kharbanda, 1956; place of burial of Patr. Yawsep VII) in the eastern part of
      al-Karrāda. The Syr. Orth. cathedral (Sts. Peter and Paul, 1964) is located further east near
      the University of Technology, and the Ancient Church of the East cathedral (Virgin Mary, 1988)
      further southeast in Ḥayy al-Riyāḍ. Another important Christian area of the city is al-Dawra
      to the south of the large bend of the Tigris, including the ‘Assyrian Quarter’ (Ḥayy
      al-Āthūriyyīn) in its southern part and Ḥayy al-Mīkānīk further south with the Ch.  of E.
      Church of Mar Zaya (built to replace the former Cathedral of Mar Zaya in Karrādat Maryam which
      was demolished by the government in 1985) and the Pontifical Babel College for Philosophy and
      Theology (founded in 1991, temporarily transferred to ʿAynkawa near Arbela in 2007). Many of
      the churches in Baghdad have been the targets of terrorist attacks in the period of
      instability since 2003.</p>
     <p>The Syriac Corporation of the Iraqi Academy of Science, originally founded as the Syriac
      Academy in 1975, has played an important role in the promotion of the academic study of
      Syriac. A Department of Syriac Language was established at the University of Baghdad in 2004.
      The troubles since 2003 have had adverse effects on the state of Syriac and Christian Arabic
      mss. in Baghdad, including those in major collections, such as those of the Chald. Monastery
      of St. Antony (collection formerly at the Monastery of Our Lady of the Seeds at <ref type="cr"
       >Alqosh</ref>), the Chald. Patriarchate (incorporating collections from elsewhere in Iraq)
      and the Ch. of E. Archbishopric, as well as those in other ecclesiastical, public and private
      collections.</p>

    <head>Bahdeidat</head>
    <div type="body">
     <p>Bahdeidat is 12 km. northeast of Jbeil (Giblet or Byblos), 47 km. from <ref type="cr"
       >Beirut</ref>, 550 m. above sea level. The small church of Mar Tadros, which is nowadays
      Maronite, is built as a single barrel-vaulted nave with a wide, protruding porch open at the
      west end. It measures ca. 13x8 m. without the porch.</p>
     <p>The east end is covered with a coherent program of wall paintings spilling over to the
      northern and southern walls of the nave. In the semi-dome is the Enthroned Christ in Majesty,
      with the Cherubim and Seraphim on either side, waving standards that give the words of the
      Trisagion. Behind the throne are the four beasts of the Apocalypse, the man (Matthew), the
      lion (Mark), the bull (Luke) and the eagle (John). Behind these are the standing figures of
      Mary and John the Baptist, their hands held out in supplication. The twelve apostles stand
      below this Vision, with the prophet Daniel at the northern end of the row and St. Stephen on
      the south.</p>
     <p>The triumphal arch shows the Christ Emmanuel, between the Sacrifice of Isaac on the north
      and Moses Receiving the Tablets of the Law on the south. Below them are Mary and Gabriel of
      the Annunciation.</p>
     <p>On the nave walls, on either side of the apse, is the equestrian knight St. Theodore
      spearing a dragon and the riding St. George, bearing the small water-carrier behind him. Both
      the equestrian knights are shown with donor portraits beneath the horses.</p>
     <p>All the wall paintings are inscribed in a mixture of Serṭo and Esṭrangela.</p>
     <p>These wall paintings represent the only comprehensive series of paintings executed by one
      workshop to have survived in Lebanon. In style they closely resemble the paintings of a church
      in the nearby village of <ref type="cr">Maʿad</ref>. According to a ms. in Dayr al-Shife, not
      far from Bahdeidat, a Syr. Orth. priest called Naʿman was ordained in Bahdeidat in 1256. This
      13th-cent. date accords with the style of the paintings in both Bahdeidat and Maʿad and they
      belong to the Syr. Orth. tradition of painting, like the paintings of <ref type="cr">Dayr Mār
       Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>. At some point after the 13th cent. the church would have passed from
      the Syr. Orth. to the Maronites.</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Balad, Assyrian Balaṭ, Syriac and Arabic Balad or Balaṭ, and modern Aski Mosul (Turkish for
      ‘Old Mosul’) are names referring to a town located some 40 km. northwest of <ref type="cr"
       >Mosul</ref>, on the west bank of the Tigris. Balad occurs in the inscriptions of the
      Assyrian king Sennacherib (BC 705–681), and in Syriac sources as part of the province of <ref
       type="cr">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>. In the late 5th cent. it became an E.-Syr. bishopric seat,
      beginning with bps Ḥawaḥ and Shubḥa l-Ishoʿ, who were present at the synod of Mar Babai that
      took place in <ref type="cr">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> in 497. The long line of E.-Syr. bps.
      ended around 1364 with Aaron. Balad was also a Syr. Orth. bishopric seat, but only one bp.,
      Mushe (mid 9th cent.), bore the title ‘bp. of Balad’. The other bishops may have resided in
      Dayr al-Muʿallaq ‘Hanging Monastery’, located some 15 km. from the city, on Mt. Buṭmān. They
      bore the title ‘bp. of Beth ʿArbaye’, having under their jurisdiction Sinjār and <ref
       type="cr">Nisibis</ref>, in addition to Balad. The last bp. was called ‘of Sinjār’ and served
      in this rank between 1317 and 1345, a fact that led Patr. <ref type="cr">Afram Barsoum</ref>
      to date the final destruction of Balad to the 14th cent. Two famous Syr. Orth. bps. originated
      from Balad, <ref type="cr">Aḥudemmeh</ref> and <ref type="cr">Athanasios II</ref>.</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Physician, scribe, and author of a Syriac-Arabic Lexicon. In spite of some confusion in the
      scholarly literature (see Butts), Ishoʿ bar ʿAli can in all likelihood be identified with ʿĪsā
      b. ʿAlī, student of the well-known translator <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873).
      From Arabic sources, it is known that he was the personal physician of Caliph al-Muʿtamid (r.
      870–892), and that he authored two works (in Arabic) in the field of medicine, the ‘Book of
      the benefits made use of from the organs of animals’ and the ‘Book of poisons’. In addition,
      he is mentioned as a scribe in the colophon of two mss. of the Arabic Diatessaron (Vatican,
      Borg. Arab. 250; Oxford, Bodleian Arab. e 163).</p>
     <p>Bar ʿAli is, however, best known for his Syriac-Arabic Lexicon (ed. Hoffmann [<hi
       rend="italic">ʾālap</hi>through <hi rend="italic">mim</hi>]; Gottheil [<hi rend="italic"
       >nun</hi> through <hi rend="italic">taw</hi>]). In the preface to his Lexicon, Bar ʿAli
      states that he undertook its writing at the behest of a certain deacon Abraham. During his
      readings, Abraham had been employing the Lexicon of Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq as well as a Lexicon
      compiled by <ref type="cr">Ishoʿ of Merv</ref>. Abraham seems to have been happy with the
      former, but less so with the latter. In addition, according to Abraham, the lexicon of Ḥunayn
      b. Isḥāq and that of Ishoʿ of Merv differed at times in their definitions. Thus, Bar ʿAli
      undertook composing a new lexicon on the basis of these two previous works and supplemented by
      his own readings. At the end of the Preface, Bar ʿAli exhorts his future readers to expand and
      supplement his Lexicon with additional words. The name of one such expander is known from a
      postscript found in some mss., and it is none other than the aforementioned deacon Abraham.</p>
     <p>The Lexicon of Bar ʿAli is an important source for Syriac lexicography. Already in the
      1830s, the Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer F. H. W. Gesenius pointed out the significance
      of Bar ʿAli’s Lexicon for Semitic studies. In addition, the Lexicon of Bar ʿAli — along with
      that of <ref type="cr">Ḥasan Bar Bahlul</ref> (mid-10th cent.) — was incorporated into R.
      Payne Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Syriacus</hi>and, to a lesser extent, C.
      Brockelmann’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Syriacum</hi>.</p>
     <p>Finally, it should be noted that Bar ʿAli is to be distinguished from two other individuals
      with similar names: 1. ʿĪsā b. ʿAlī, who was the son of the ‘good vizier’ ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā b.
      Dāʾūd b. al-Jarrāḥ (d. 946), who was a student of <ref type="cr">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (d. 974),
      and who died in 1001 (see J. L. Kraemer, <hi rend="italic">Humanism in the Renaissance of
       Islam. The cultural revival during the Buyid age</hi> [1986], 134–36); 2. ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā
      al-kaḥḥāl, who authored the ‘Prescription of Oculists’<hi rend="italic"></hi>(<hi
       rend="italic">tadhkirat al-kaḥḥālīn</hi>), who was a student of <ref type="cr">Ibn
       al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043), and who died sometime after 1010 (see E. Mittwoch, in <hi
       rend="italic">EI</hi>2, vol. 1, 388).</p>

     <p>Scholar and lexicographer. Born in Awāna, ca. 60 km. north of <ref type="cr">Baghdad</ref>,
      in the region of Ṭirhan, Bar Bahlul spent most of his life in Baghdad and belonged to the
      Christian intellectual elite, who interacted with Muslim scholars and were thoroughly
      bilingual. Bar Bahlul used both Syriac and Arabic in his publications. He was involved in the
      election of Cath. ʿAbdishoʿ I in 963.</p>
     <p>Bar Bahlul’s Lexicon (Syr. <hi rend="italic">Leksiqon</hi>) deals with scholarly and
      technical terminology and includes both Syriac words and Greek words in Syriac
      transliteration. The explanations are primarily in Syriac, but mostly contain equivalents
      and/or short comments in Arabic. Common Syriac words are normally not included. The words are
      taken from the Bible as well as from theological, philosophical, and scientific writings; a
      number of proper names are included as well. The words are in alphabetical order, even though
      Bar Bahlul occasionally groups together Syriac words that are based on the same root. The
      Lexicon brings the Syriac tradition of lexico­graphy to full fruition. In composing it, Bar
      Bahlul heavily relied on two works by <ref type="cr">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873) — a work
      on homographs and a no longer extant lexicon proper (<hi rend="italic">puššāq šmāhe</hi>) — as
      well as on a no longer extant lexicon by <ref type="cr">Ḥenanishoʿ bar Seroshway</ref> (ca.
      900).</p>
     <p>By way of these main sources and through personal reading Bar Bahlul included in his work
      words culled from many different authors and texts of Greek, Syriac, and Arabic origin. Some
      Syr. Orth. authors are occasionally quoted as well, such as <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of
       Serugh</ref>, <ref type="cr">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Mushe bar
      Kipho</ref>, along with a few non-Christian works, such as the Proverbs of the <ref type="cr"
       >Arameans</ref> (<hi rend="italic">matle d-Ārāmāye</hi>) — a title that reminds one of the
       <ref type="cr">Aḥiqar</ref> proverbs — and <ref type="cr">Kalila and Dimna</ref>. Bar Bahlul
      also provides rare information on dialectal variation within the Syriac language of his day,
      referring, among others, to the languages of <ref type="cr">Beth Aramaye</ref>, <ref type="cr"
       >Beth Qaṭraye</ref>, <ref type="cr">Beth Garmai</ref>, <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> (Atur),
      Gazarta, <ref type="cr">Edessa</ref>, and <ref type="cr">Ḥarran</ref>. Several words,
      expressions, names, and titles of works are known to us only through Bar Bahlul’s Lexicon,
      which has rightly been called a ‘linguistic and cultural encyclopedia’ (Ḥabbi). Preserved in
      both E.- and W.-Syr. mss., much of the information of the ‘Lexicon’ was incorporated in the
      modern dictionaries of R. Payne Smith and, to a lesser extent, of C. Brockelmann.</p>
     <p>Another work by Bar Bahlul became known only a few decades ago. His ‘Book of signs’ (<hi
       rend="italic">Kitāb al-dalāʾil</hi>), written in Arabic between 942 and 968, has the same
      encyclopedic breadth as the Lexicon. Probably intended as a manual for travelers, it deals
      with issues of calendar and, among other things, lists the festivals and commemorative days of
      Christians, Muslims (arranged according to the lunar months), Jews, Armenians, Copts, the
      people of Ḥarran, and the Sabians. Of particular importance is Bar Bahlul’s insider
      information on the feasts of the Ch. of E. Toward the end, the scope of this work broadens; a
      final section on dream interpretation has been identified as a summary rewriting of the dream
      manual written by the Muslim author Ibn Qutayba (d. 889).</p>

     <p>Maph. (since 1264) and polymath. Foremost representative of the <ref type="cr">Syriac
       Renaissance</ref> of the 12th–13th cent. Bar ʿEbroyo was born as a son of the physician Ahrun
      in <ref type="cr">Melitene</ref>. The view that links his name to a Jewish ancestry is best
      rejected in favor of one associating it with the village of ʿEbro on the Euphrates downstream
      of Melitene. After periods of study in <ref type="cr">Antioch</ref>, Tripoli (both then still
      in the hands of the Crusaders) and, possibly, <ref type="cr">Damascus</ref>, Bar ʿEbroyo was
      made bp. in 1246 of Gubos and a little later of Laqabin (both sees in the vicinity of
      Melitene) by Patr. Ignatius III Dawid<ref type="cr"></ref>(Maphr. 1215–22, Patr. 1222–52). In
      the schism that followed the death of Ignatius III, Bar ʿEbroyo sided at first with Dionysios
       ʿAngur<ref type="cr"></ref>(Patr. 1252–61) and was appointed by him in ca. 1253 to the see
      of <ref type="cr">Aleppo</ref>, where he was to witness the fall of the city to the Mongols in
      1260. The synod held in Cilicia following the death of Patr. <ref type="cr">Yuḥanon bar
       Maʿdani</ref> in 1264 saw the double election of Ignatius IV Yeshuʿ (Patr. 1264–82) to the
      patriarchate and of Bar ʿEbroyo to the maphrianate. Bar ʿEbroyo’s normal place of residence as
      maph. was <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref> and the nearby <ref type="cr">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>,
      but a significant part of his maphrianate was spent in Maragha and Tabriz, the new centers of
      power and learning under the Mongol Īl-Khāns, where Bar ʿEbroyo befriended the leading Muslim
      scholars of the day. During his maphrianate Bar ʿEbroyo ordained a total of twelve bishops,
      including his biographer <ref type="cr">Diosqoros of Gozarto</ref>, and saw his erstwhile
      disciple Philoxenos Nemrod<ref type="cr"></ref>(Patr. 1283–92) elected to the patriarchate in
      1283. He also entertained a friendly relationship with his Ch. of E. counterparts Denḥa I
      (Cath. 1265–81) and <ref type="cr">Yahbalaha III</ref>. Bar ʿEbroyo died in Maragha on 29/30
      July 1286. His remains were later transferred to Dayro d-Mor Matay, where they rest to this
      day together with those of his younger brother and successor in the maphrianate, <ref
       type="cr">Grigorios Barṣawmo Ṣafī</ref>.</p>
     <p>Bar ʿEbroyo composed over forty works covering a wide range of subjects, mostly in Syriac,
      but occasionally also in Arabic. Taken as a whole, Bar ʿEbroyo’s literary output may be seen
      as an attempt at a revival of learning in Syriac through the use of the latest scholarly
      literature which was available in his day mostly in Arabic. Bar ʿEbroyo frequently modelled
      his works on works of Arabic and Persian authors (e.g. Ibn Sīnā, Ghazālī, Naṣīr al-Dīn
      al-Ṭūsī) and incorporated into the framework provided by these models materials taken from
      both Arabo-Persian and Syriac sources, thus making a new synthesis out of the older Syriac and
      more recent Arabo-Persian literature. Bar ʿEbroyo has often been characterised as a skillful
      but unoriginal compiler of earlier works. This is a characterization that overlooks the
      originality to be found in his choice of sources and in his openness to the knowledge found in
      the works of Islamic scholars and those of other Christian denominations. His works were to
      remain for a long time the standard texts in many fields not only among the Christians of the
      W.-Syr. tradition but also among those of the E.-Syr. and Maron. traditions. Many of his works
      were later translated into Arabic, most notably by <ref type="cr">Daniel of Mardin</ref>
      (1326/7 – after 1382) and Grigorios Yūḥannā b. al-Ghurayr al-Zurbābī<ref type="cr"></ref>(Bp.
      of Damascus 1668–84).</p>
     <p>His literary works include:</p>
     <p>1.   Exegesis: ‘Storehouse of mysteries’ (<hi rend="italic">Awṣar roze</hi>).</p>

     <p>Disciple of <ref type="cr">Abraham of Kashkar</ref>; monastic leader. Bar ʿEdta is credited
      with the foundation of an important monastery, probably in 561 (or 571). The location of this
      monastery, which traditionally was assumed to be to the north of the village of Tarjilla, ca.
      6 km. east/northeast of <ref type="cr">Karamlish</ref> (near <ref type="cr">Mosul</ref>), was
      questioned by Fiey, who argued instead for a location in the district of Marga, near the river
      Khāzir. This monastery is said to have had as many as 400 monks. Bar ʿEdta’s life is known
      ­primarily through a metrical composition by Abraham Zabaya (from the region near the river
      Zab), who wrote at the request of the metropolitan Bp. ʿAbdishoʿ (who might have been <ref
       type="cr">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</ref>, even though it cannot be ruled out that we are dealing
      with an 11th-cent. namesake). Abraham mentions as his main source a prose narrative by Bar
      ʿEdta’s disciple Yoḥannan the Persian. Bar ʿEdta also features prominently in <ref type="cr"
       >Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>’s ‘Book of chastity’ and is discussed both in <ref type="cr">Toma of
       Marga</ref>’s ‘Book of governors’ and in the Chronicle of <ref type="cr">Siirt</ref>. Among
      Bar ʿEdta’s many disciples was Rabban Hormizd. Bar ʿEdta thus played an important role in the
      transmission of E.-Syr. monastic ideals.</p>

    <div type="body">
     <p>Earliest known Syriac author. He was active at the court of Abgar VIII (177–212) in <ref
       type="cr">Edessa</ref>, where the chronicler Julius Africanus met him in 195 (<hi
       rend="italic">Kestoi</hi> I.20), and recorded his skill at archery. Bardaiṣan’s name derives
      from that of the river Daiṣan (Greek <hi rend="italic">Skirtos</hi> ‘Leaper’) which in his day
      flowed through Edessa. His own writings, which included works against <ref type="cr"
       >Marcion</ref> and the Chaldeans (that is, astrologers), are unfortunately lost, since his
      views on cosmology were later considered unorthodox. What survives is a philosophical dialogue
      on fate and freewill in which Bardaiṣan is the protagonist; this work, probably by his pupil
      Philip, is generally known as the ‘Book of the Laws of the Countries’, due to a section on
      ethnography (whose accuracy in the passage on Ḥaṭra is now confirmed by a Ḥaṭran inscription,
      no. 281). The work was translated into Greek, and quotations from it are given in <ref
       type="cr">Eusebius</ref>’s ‘<hi rend="italic">Preparation for the Gospel</hi>’ (VI.10.1–48)
      and the ‘Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions’ (IX.19–29). His teaching, some of which was conveyed
      in verse as well as in prose, has to be reconstructed from later hostile sources (above all,
       <ref type="cr">Ephrem</ref>); it was evidently syncretistic in character, with elements drawn
      from Greek philosophy and Iranian and Gnostic cosmology; it may have served <ref type="cr"
       >Mani</ref> as a partial model. The teaching on freewill in the ‘Book of the Laws of the
      Countries’ has been shown to be largely dependent on Alexander of Aphrodisias.</p>
