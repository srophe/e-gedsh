                <div type="body">
                    <p>Teacher of biblical interpretation, author, Cath. (540–52). Born from Zoroastrian
               parents, Aba converted to Christianity and studied at the <ref rend="bold">School of
                  Nisibis</ref>. He traveled to the Roman Empire and visited <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (where he was taught Greek, probably by his later disciple <ref rend="bold">Toma of Edessa</ref>), Palestine, Egypt, and Constantinople. Upon his
               return, he became a teacher of biblical interpretation (<hi rend="italic">mpaššqānā</hi>) at the <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref> and subsequently at
               the School of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, which he is said to have
               founded. Following the death of Cath. Pawlos, he was elected as his successor in 540.
               In 544 an itinerant synod was held, during which Aba, accompanied by a changing
               number of bishops, visited several dioceses, many of which still suffered from the
               division in the church that had existed prior to the short tenure of Cath. Pawlos.
               The <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref> has preserved the following documents,
               which are related to this ecclesiastical visitation and, more broadly, to Aba’s
               reforms: 1. on reform of church governance; 2. on the orthodox faith; 3. on the <hi rend="italic">politeia</hi> of correct behavior (focusing on Christian marriage
               and rejecting various kinds of illicit unions); 4. on the deposal of the initiators
               of division and schism; 5. on the various degrees in the ecclesiastical hierarchy; 6.
               a letter entitled <hi rend="italic">Practica</hi> (fragments); 7. canons (1–40;
               incomplete). Aba came into conflict with the Persian authorities and spent several of
               his years as Cath. in prison and in exile.</p>
                    <p>The sources attribute to Aba several commentaries on OT and NT books, of which only
               fragments exist in later works, such as the commentaries of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad
                  of Merv</ref>. During his travels, around 530, he served as the instructor in
               biblical matters to the Egyptian author Cosmas Indicopleustes, who ca.  550 wrote his
               ‘Christian Topography’. Cosmas (in Book II.2) acknowledges Aba, whom he calls
               Patrikios (derived from the Greek word for ‘father’), as his source and is aware of
               Aba’s later election as Cath. in Persia. Interested in the Greek originals of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>’s and <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref>’s
               works, Aba may have gathered around him a team of translators. One of these may have
               been the Syriac translator of Nestorius’s ‘Book of Heraclides’, who dedicated his
               work to Aba. A comment in the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref> led Baumstark
               to suggest that Aba may have authored a Syriac translation of the Greek OT, but this
               cannot be substantiated.</p>
                    <p>In addition to a number of Syriac and Arabic sources providing details of Aba’s life,
               there is an important Syriac Life (published by Bedjan), which presents itself as the
               work of one of Aba’s disciples. Two of Aba’s other disciples, <ref rend="bold">Qiyore
                  of Edessa</ref> and Toma of Edessa (who died in Constantinople around 543), are
               known through their own writings.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Scholar, Bp. of Kashkar, and Cath. (741–751). Born in (the vicinity of) Kashkar in
               641 as son of Brik Ṣebyaneh (‘Blessed be His Will’). He received his education in the
               School of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> and was for a certain time Bp. of
               Kashkar before his election as Cath. in 741. In the sixth year of his Catholicate a
               conflict between Aba and the clergy of Seleucia-Ctesiphon arose; the latter accused
               the Cath. of having illegally taken the possessions of the city’s School. According
               to a letter written by Aba to the director, the teachers, and the other ‘brothers’ of
               the School, these charges were brought against him while he stayed outside the
               patriarchal seat for some time (probably for reasons of health). According to some
               medieval sources the Cath. retired in a monastery of al-Wāsiṭ for a year, but
               returned to Seleucia-Ctesiphon after the conflict was settled. Aba is known as the
               author of different works which, except for ‘the Letter to the leaders of the
               School’, are lost: the Book of the Governors (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā
                  d-esṭraṭige</hi>), a Commentary on the Theologian (<ref rend="bold">Gregory of
                  Nazianzus</ref>), a Commentary on some works concerning dialectics (probably some
               books of the ‘Organon’ of <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>), a Homily on the Martyr
               Zakhe, and Exegetical Homilies (<hi rend="italic">Memre puššāqāye</hi>). From the
               latter many fragments and extracts have been preserved in the <ref rend="bold">Gannat
                  Bussāme</ref>, containing the exegesis of passages from Gen., Num., Isa., and the
               four Gospels. These fragments and extracts are of great importance for the cultural
               and intellectual history of the Ch. of E. for at least three reasons: 1.  they
               represent the genre of exegetical prose homilies in a style which shows a strong
               influence from and a very sophisticated use of Greek rhetoric; 2. they show a very
               dynamic and varied exegetical tradition, in which not only influences from the works
               of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> but also from the works of <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref> and from the ancient tradition of the <ref rend="bold">School of Edessa</ref> become noticeable; 3. they present interesting
               early examples of apologetic and polemic dispute in response to Islamic criticism of
               Christian tenets such as the Trinity and the Divinity of Christ. Although Aba is
               reported to have maintained as Cath. good relations with the Muslim governor of Iraq,
               Yūsuf b. ʿUmar al-Thaqafī, his homilies testify that he took a fierce polemical stand
               against the anti-Christian proclamations that the Arab authorities propagated in his
               days.</p>

                    <p>Disciple of <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, author, and biblical commentator. The
               ‘Testament of Ephrem’ mentions Aba as the first of Ephrem’s seven disciples. He must,
               therefore, be the same person as ‘Mar Aba, the disciple of Ephrem’ to whom several
               fragments are attributed in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,194, a 9th-cent. W.-Syr.
               collection of extracts from exegetical and theological works. These fragments,
               published by Nau, are taken from a Commentary on the Gospel (3 fragments), a Psalm
               Commentary (one fragment), and a <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> on Job the (OT) athlete
               (one fragment). To these meager remains some new texts may perhaps be added.</p>
                    <p>Aba is explicitly quoted in a work on the Holy Chrism by <ref rend="bold">Anṭun of
                  Tagrit</ref>, which exists in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,726 (f. 72r–85r) and
               remains unpublished.</p>
                    <p>In 1975, Beck published a long extract (240 lines of 7 syllables each) from a poem
               attributed to ‘Mar Aba, the disciple of the holy Mar Ephrem’ from ms. Sin. Syr. 67
               (9th cent.). It deals with God’s immeasurable power and mercy.</p>
                    <p>In 1980, Reinink drew attention to forty fragments preserved in the <ref rend="bold">Gannat Bussāme</ref> and quoted under Ephrem’s name. While other fragments
               bearing Ephrem’s name in the same work can be located in Ephrem’s Commentary on the
                  <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref>, these forty fragments do not belong to that
               work. Similarities with the previously identified Aba fragments suggest Aba’s
               authorship. These unpublished fragments show the author’s familiarity with the
               Diatessaron, even though he also knew the four separate Gospels.</p>
                    <p>More recently, among the <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> mss. a long ascetic text
               has come to light under the title ‘<hi rend="italic">Memrā</hi> on faith’ (<hi rend="italic">haymānutā</hi>). In two marginal notes the work is identified as
               ‘Book of the mind’ (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-reʿyānā</hi>) and is explicitly
               attributed to ‘Mar Aba, the disciple of Mar Ephrem’. Possible connections come to
               mind with a <hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-reʿyāne</hi> (plur.), translated by W.  Wright
               as ‘Book of sentences’, which is attributed to Ephrem and extracts of which exist in
               ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,167, f. 293v. It cannot be ruled out that we are
               dealing here with an example of the entanglement between the literary heritage of the
               master and the disciple. If that is the case, future research hopefully will be able
               to delineate the disciple’s contribution and to bring him out of his master’s
               shadow.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Logician, theologian, legal scholar, translator, and metropolitan, first of <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref>, and later of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> and Ḥazza. The
               name ‘Bahrīz’ reveals his Persian descent. Ḥabīb was probably his given name and
               ʿAbdishoʿ his ecclesiastical name. Most of our information about ʿAbdishoʿ derives
               from Muslim sources, most importantly from Ibn al-Nadīm, who mentions that he
               translated many works of logic and philosophy, and that he wrote commentaries on
               classical works for the Abbasid Caliph al-Maʾmūn (d. 833), and made summaries of <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>’s ‘Categories’ and ‘On Interpretation’. Ibn al-Nadīm
               also makes reference to his works in defense of ‘Nestorian’ Christology, among which
               is a response to two works by a Syr. Orth., in which ʿAbdishoʿ refuted the Syr. Orth.
               and Melk. belief in the ‘oneness of hypostasis’ (in Christ), and hence showed that
               ‘his wisdom was close to the wisdom of Islam’. In an anonymous report of a brief
               Christological discussion between ‘ʿAbdishoʿ, the Nestorian Muṭrān, <ref rend="bold">Abū Qurra</ref>, the Melkite Bishop, and Abū Rāʾiṭa, the Jacobite’ before a
               Muslim vizier (ed. with ET by Toenies Keating), the name of the ‘Nestorian’ has been
               taken by most modern scholars as a reference to Cath. <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar
                  Nun</ref> (823–28), but it is more likely that this name points to ʿAbdishoʿ bar
               Bahrīz, who was also a contemporary of these interlocutors. ʿAbdishoʿ’s apologetic
               work entitled <hi rend="italic">Maqāla fī al-tawḥīd wa-al-tathlīth</hi>, ‘Treatise on
               the Unity and Trinity (of God)’ possibly still survives in mss. in Syria that have
               remained inaccessible so far (see Swanson). Of two works that have been published,
               one is in Syriac and one in Arabic. The former is his legal handbook on marriage and
               inheritance law (ed. Selb), the latter a treatise on logic based on Aristotle’s
               ‘Categories’ and <ref rend="bold">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Isagoge’ (ed. Dānishpazhūh). This
               work on logic, <hi rend="italic">Kitāb ḥudūd al-manṭiq</hi>, was commissioned by
               Caliph al-Maʾmūn. ʿAbdishoʿ’s connection with the Abbasid elite is further evidenced
               by the fact that he translated Nicomachus’s ‘Introduction to Arithmetic’ from Syriac
               into Arabic, for the Abbasid general Ṭāhir b. al-Ḥusayn (see Freudenthal and Lévy).
               He also translated works for his friend <ref rend="bold">Gabriel bar Bokhtisho</ref>ʿ,
               presumably in the field of medicine.</p>

                    <p>Bp. and scholar. ʿAbdishoʿ was bp. of Sinjar and <ref rend="bold">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>,
               before becoming metropolitan bp. of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> (Ṣoba) and Armenia
               (ca. 1291). He wrote in Syriac and in Arabic. Although in many ways his writings
               crowned the achievements of a highly productive era in E.-Syr. scholarship, many of
               them do not survive, e.g. a commentary on OT and NT, along with other works treating
               doctrine, canon law, philosophy, and science. His surviving works include: <hi rend="italic">Margānitā</hi> ‘The Pearl’, an influential systematic explanation of
               E.-Syr. theology; the <hi rend="italic">Nomocanon</hi>, a compilation of synodal

               authoritative in the Ch. of E.; a ‘Treatise on the Rule of Ecclesiastical
               Judgements’, for use as an ecclesiastical court manual; and a collection of
               theological poetry entitled ‘Paradise of Eden’ (also known as the <hi rend="italic">Maqāmāt</hi>). His metrical ‘Catalogue of Books’ is an invaluable repository of
               information about the authors and works of the Syriac literary heritage, including
               many that are no longer extant. Published with a Latin translation by J.-S. Assemani
               in Rome in 1725, the ‘Catalogue’ helped clarify for western scholarship the breadth
               and basic contours of Syriac literature, providing stimulus and some direction for
               the nascent study of Syriac literary history in the West.</p>

                    <p>ʿAbdishoʿ bar Yoḥannan d-Beth Maron, monk of the monastery of Mar Aḥa the Egyptian,
               in the region of Gazarta (Cizre), participated in the Synod which deposed Patr.
               Shemʿon VII bar Mama (1552) and elected <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref> as
               Patr. Cath. Recognized by the Pope, Yoḥannan ordained ʿAbdishoʿ Metr. of Gazarta.
               After Yoḥannan Sullaqa’s violent death in 1555, ʿAbdishoʿ succeeded him as Patr. of
               the newly established E.-Syr. Uniate (Chaldean) Church. He mainly resided in the
               Monastery of Yaʿqob the Recluse near <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref>.</p>
                    <p>He wrote three Syriac panegyrics of unequal length on his predecessor. The first
               describes the alleged debaucheries of Patr. Shemʿon VII bar Mama, the election of
               Yoḥannan Sullaqa, his journey to Rome and his profession of faith submitted to the
               Pope, his consecration as archbishop and Patr. and his return to the Middle East. The
               work ends with an original description of the churches of Rome. The second poem
               describes the assassination of Yoḥannan Sullaqa at the instigation of Shemʿon  VII.
               The third is a funeral <hi rend="italic">madrāšā</hi>. He composed in Syriac a
               profession of faith, destined to the Roman authorities (original lost, preserved in
               different Latin redactions and a retroversion into Syriac), an acrostic <hi rend="italic">turgāmā</hi> in honor of Pope Paul IV, several liturgical pieces, a
               grammatical poem, and a <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> on the soul.</p>

                    <p>Patr. (1521–57) and advocate for <ref rend="bold">printing</ref> the first Syriac NT.
               He was born in Qalʿat Mara probably at the end of the 15th cent. ʿAbdullāh moved the
               patriarchal see temporarily from <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> to <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>. Having heard about the possibilities of printing books in
               Europe, ʿAbdullāh sent his student <ref rend="bold">Mushe of Mardin</ref> to Rome
               sometime before 1549, armed with two mss. of the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> NT.
               ʿAbdullāh lived to see the first printed edition of the Syriac NT, brought to light
               by Mushe and Widmanstadius in 1555. His name appeared in the colophons.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Jersualem</ref> (1872–4) and Patr. (1906–15). Born in Ṣadad of
               deacon Jirjis b. ʿAbdullāh Saṭṭūf and Nasra b. Ḥanna al-Tawīl. He joined <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> in 1857, and later taught at <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> for six years where he was consecrated a deacon. In 1866, he became
               the secretary of Patr. Yaʿqub II in <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref> who, on 19 Feb. 1867,
               tonsured him, then ordained him to the priesthood after two weeks. In 1870, he toured
               the area of <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> and recorded the names of villages,
               monasteries, churches, clergy, and the families living in the area (ed. Bcheiry). He
               was consecrated bp. of Jerusalem on 3 Sept. 1872 by Patr. Peṭros IV and was named
               Gregorius. ʿAbdullāh accompanied the Patr. to England and India from 1874 to 1877.
               After the return of the Patr. from India, ʿAbdullāh stayed for two more years before
               going back to London where he secured a printing press for Dayr al-Zaʿfarān. After
               his return, ʿAbdullāh served as the bp. of Syria from 1880 to 1886.</p>
                    <p>ʿAbdullāh paid a second visit to London, during which he attended sessions of the
               1888 Lambeth Conference, and secured a second printing press. In 1890 he became the
               bp. of Amid. In 1895 or 1896, the Armenians persuaded ʿAbdullāh to sign a petition
               which, according to Shahīn, ‘went against the wishes of the Ottoman government’. The
               government issued an order for his exile, but ʿAbdullāh took refuge with the French
               consul where he joined the <ref rend="bold">Syriac Catholic Church</ref>. In the Syriac
               Catholic Synod of 1898 in <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>, ʿAbdullāh was appointed Syriac
               Catholic bp. of <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref> and Ḥama, and on 9  Oct. 1898 he
               participated in the election of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref>,
               and accompanied him in 1902 to Rome, France, and Constantinople. After the deposition
               of the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdulmasīḥ  II</ref> on 10 Nov. 1903,
               ʿAbdullāh was elected and then consecrated Syr. Orth. Patr. on 5 Aug. 1906. Shortly
               after, he visited London for the third time <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> to India
               in 1908–12. In London, he met King Edward VII twice. In India, he established the
               Knaʿanaya diocese. After his return from India in 1912, he stayed at the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St. Mark</ref> until his death in 1915 and was buried
               there. ʿAbdullāh received a medal from King Edward VII, and two Ottoman medals from
               the Ottoman sultan. In 1910 he reopened the seminary at Dayr al-Zaʿfarān. He
               established al-Ḥikma Magazine in 1913. That same year he established for the first
               time a council that consisted of six clergy and six laymen. The council held its
               first session from 20 Feb. until 17 March 1914 but was short lived due to World War
               I.</p>

                    <p>Abgar is named as the author of the martyrdom of Hormizd and his nine companions from

               (r.  399–420). P. Devos has convincingly shown that three other martyrologies — the
               martyrdom of Narsai of Beth Raziqaye, of Ṭaṭaq of <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref>, and
               of Yaʿqub the Notary  — must also have been written by Abgar. These four martyr texts
               are grouped together in ms. Berlin, Or. oct. 1257 and share similar content and
               style. The execution of all these martyrs took place at Sleq Ḥarobta, not far from
                  <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, and in the proximity of a monastery to
               which in all likelihood Abgar belonged. The ‘cycle of Abgar’, as Devos has named it,
               must have been composed between 421 and 424 (prior to the synod of <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ</ref> and covers the very last years of Yazdgard I’s and the beginning
               of Vahram V Gor’s (r. 420–38) reigns. Abgar must have been a direct witness to many
               of these events, and he describes them in a sober style.</p>

                    <p>Dynasty of kings who ruled in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> from ca. 133 BC until the
               middle of the 3rd cent. The most common names in this line of kings are Abgar and
               Maʿnu, both of which are of a North Arabian type. The disintegration of the Seleucid
               Empire in the 2nd cent. BC allowed the Abgarids to establish their power. With the
               appearance of the Romans in the Near East in the 1st cent. BC, the Abgarids were able
               to maintain Edessa and the surrounding area of Osrhoene as a more or less independent
               buffer state between the Roman and the Parthian empires. Our main source for the list
               of ca. 30 Edessene kings is the late 8th-cent. <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of
                  Zuqnin</ref>. Additional information is occasionally provided by other sources,
               Syriac and non-Syriac, as well as by coins. Of particular interest is the E.-Syr.
               Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (d. 1046).</p>
                    <p>Our knowledge of the earliest history is very limited. It becomes more substantial
               from the moment when Rome began to extend its reach into Mesopotamia, i.e., from
               Abgar VII (109–116) on through the end of the dynasty. In the 2nd and early 3rd cent.
               the relationship between Rome and Edessa intensified; it reached its climax under
               Abgar VIII, the Great (177–212). Rome finally imposed its power on Edessa when in
               212/13 the short-lived reign of Abgar VIII’s successor was ended and the city
               declared a Roman colonia. The dynasty was briefly restored in 239, but by 242 Rome
               had once again taken full control. Whether this was the definitive end or whether the
               dynasty in one form or another continued to exist for some years, as <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> seems to suggest in his Chronicle, is unclear.</p>
                    <p>It is under the Abgarid kings that the distinctive <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref>
               language form that later became known as ‘Syriac’ first started being used in <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref>. The <ref rend="bold">script</ref> of the inscriptions
               is closely related to the <hi rend="italic">Esṭrangela</hi> of the earliest,
               5th-cent. Syriac mss. (even though some of the mosaic inscriptions exhibit a slightly
               more cursive type). Mosaics, numismatic evidence, and a number of inscriptions,
               mostly funerary, provide glimpses into Edessa’s social and cultural life. In addition
               to its Aramaic background, these also reveal the impact of Roman as well as of
               Parthian culture. Several of the preserved mosaics can be dated to the reign of Abgar
               VIII or to the period when Edessa was under Roman rule.</p>
                    <p>The two kings most closely associated with Syriac Christianity are Abgar V Ukkama
               (‘the Black’, 4  BC–AD 7 and 13–50) and Abgar VIII. The former was alleged to have
               corresponded with Jesus and, at the arrival of the apostle Addai, to have converted
               to Christianity, along with most of the city. This legend is first mentioned in <ref rend="bold">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History (early 4th cent.)
               and is further developed in the early 5th-cent. <ref rend="bold">Teaching of
                  Addai</ref>. Some scholars have suggested that the historical kernel relates to
               Abgar VIII and was retrojected into the reign of Abgar V. However, the few
               indications that Abgar VIII might have been a Christian each pose their problems.
               First, the addition in the Book of the Laws of Countries, by <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>’s pupil Philippus (ca. 200), that Abgar VIII outlawed the
               practice of self-castration ‘when he came to faith’ (<hi rend="italic">kad
                  haymen</hi>) may very well be a later interpolation, as it is lacking from the
               quotation of the relevant passage in Eusebius of Caesarea’s ‘<hi rend="italic">Preparation for the Gospel</hi>’ (VI,10,44). Second, even though Sextus Julius
               Africanus describes Abgar VIII as a ‘holy man’ (as quoted from the ‘Kestoi’ in George
               Synkellos’s ‘<hi rend="italic">Chronography’</hi>), this does not necessarily point
               to the Christian religion. As a matter of fact, the various renderings of this term
               include not only <hi rend="italic">hieros</hi>‘holy’ (<hi rend="italic">Synkellos</hi>), <hi rend="italic">sanctus</hi>‘holy’ (Jerome’s Latin translation
               of Eusebius’s Chronicle), and <hi rend="italic">kāhnāyā</hi> ‘priestly’ (Yaʿqub of
               Edessa), but also terms that do not take on a religious connotation, such as <hi rend="italic">šappirā</hi> ‘excellent’ (Chronicle to the year 724) and <hi rend="italic">azniw</hi> ‘noble’ (Armenian version of Eusebius’s Chronicle). Also
               noteworthy is the fact that the coins and the mosaic portrait of Abgar VIII
               (published by Drijvers) do not reveal any Christian symbols or ideology. It is very
               unlikely, therefore, that Abgar VIII — or any other king of the Abgar dynasty — ever
               converted to Christianity. Christianity, however, did exist in Edessa under
               Abgar  VIII. According to Sextus Julius Africanus, the Christian author Bardaiṣan was
               an intimate of the royal court. In addition, a brief comment (seen by some as a later
               addition) in the account of the flood of Edessa in the year 201, as preserved in the
               6th-cent. <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, reports that the ‘sanctuary of
               the church of the Christians’ (<hi rend="italic">hayklā d-ʿedtā da-kresṭyāne</hi>)
               had suffered damage.</p>
                    <p>If none of the Edessene kings ever was Christian, it is all the more interesting that
               the Abgarid dynasty, decades after its disappearance, had a Christian afterlife and
               became an important element in the self-definition of Syriac Christians.</p>

                    <p>Teacher of biblical interpretation and director of the <ref rend="bold">School of
                  Nisibis</ref>. Our main sources for Abraham’s life are the two works attributed to
                  <ref rend="bold">Barḥadbshabba</ref> and the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">               Siirt</ref>. The second part of Abraham’s name, ‘from the house of our master’ (<hi rend="italic">d-Beth Rabban</hi>), is generally understood to refer to <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>, the first director of the School of Nisibis, who may have
               been Abraham’s relative. Barḥadbshabba the historian presents Abraham as Narsai’s
               immediate successor and in charge of the school for 20 years (502/3 – ca. 522).
               According to Barḥadbeshabba, Abraham was then temporarily replaced by <ref rend="bold">Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye</ref> but he returned to his office a few years later and
               held it until his death, probably in 569. Other sources present Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye
               as Narsai’s immediate successor and put the beginning of Abraham’s tenure ca. 510.
               For some time during his directorship Abraham may have been assisted by his relative
                  <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan of Beth Rabban</ref>. During Abraham’s directorship the
               School flourished and had its greatest expansion, despite Abraham often being the
               target of attacks both from within and from outside the E.-Syr. community.</p>
                    <p>Barḥadbshabba the historian credits Abraham with building activities in the School,
               including a hospice (<hi rend="italic">xenodochion</hi>) for the sick and cells and
               baths for the students. As an instructor in biblical interpretation he may have
               played an important role in the transmission of the commentaries of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia.</ref>Barḥadbshabba reports that ‘he edited and explained’
                  (<hi rend="italic">ktab w-paššeq</hi>) Theodore’s commentaries, because they were
               too difficult for the students. In this process he is said to have followed ‘the
               tradition that he had received from his teacher’ (i.e. Narsai). Unfortunately, none
               of Abraham’s works have survived. He is, however, often quoted in later E.-Syr.
               commentaries on several OT books.</p>

                    <p>Monk, founder and abbot of the ‘Great Monastery’ on Mount Izla. Several biographical
               accounts of Abraham’s life have been preserved, but since their primary goal was to
               establish Abraham’s authority as monastic reformer, their historical information
               should be used with caution.</p>
                    <p>Abraham was from the region of Kashkar (later al-Wāsiṭ, in present-day southern
               Iraq). After a period of preaching in <ref rend="bold">Ḥirta</ref>, he is said to have
               traveled to the Egyptian desert of Scetis, to Mount Sinai, and to <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>. He then spent some time at the <ref rend="bold">School of
                  Nisibis</ref>, where he studied with <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref>
               and with <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan of Beth Rabban</ref>, before settling, around the
               middle of the 6th cent., on Mount Izla, in the vicinity of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>. He built the ‘Great Monastery’ and assembled many disciples.
               A  monastic rule, consisting of twelve canons, was issued in 570. In the following
               decades, Abraham’s disciples founded monasteries all over Mesopotamia and Persia.
               Many of the great ascetics of the Ch. of E. are associated with Abraham’s monastic
               movement.</p>
                    <p>Monastic life on Mount Izla was of the Egyptian type and consisted of a combination
               of solitary and coenobitic lifestyles. Whether it was modeled on monasticism in
               Scetis as Abraham personally experienced it during his travels, or whether Abraham’s
               alleged Egyptian ‘pilgrimage’ served to legitimate the reform, remains an open
               question. It also is debated whether E.-Syr. Christianity was exposed to Egyptian
               asceticism only in Abraham’s day or whether this already had happened much earlier,
               perhaps under Mar <ref rend="bold">Awgen</ref>, the 4th-cent. Egyptian ascetic who was
               said to have come to Mesopotamia.</p>
                    <p>Although asceticism and monasticism must have existed in the Ch. of E. long before
               Abraham, they had been marginalized by the synods of the late 5th  cent. Abraham
               succeeded in bringing them back to the center of the church, where they developed
               under the control of the ecclesiastical and theological authorities. Abraham is said
               to have introduced a distinct tonsure and dress for the monks of his new movement,
               thus distinguishing them from Syr. Orth. monks as well as from dissenters within the
               Ch. of E. who, continuing perhaps some of the earlier patterns of asceticism, were
               often branded as ‘Messalians’.</p>

                    <p>Monastic author. Very little is known about the life of Abraham. ‘Nathpar’ (in some
               sources, ‘Nephtar’, or ‘Nephrath’) appears to be the same as modern Guwair, southeast
               of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> in Iraq, and may designate either Abraham’s birthplace
               or the site of his monastery. Abraham flourished during the period of monastic
               revival sweeping the Ch. of E. due to the reforms of <ref rend="bold">Abraham of
                  Kashkar</ref> at Mount Izla. The ‘Catalogue’ of <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ
               </ref>credits Abraham with having written ‘various compositions’, mainly on the
               spiritual life, some of which were translated into Persian. A study of them suggests
               that Abraham tended to adapt older ascetic materials (e.g. <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref>) rather than compose his own. Some of the works ascribed to him
               actually derive from other authors (e.g. <ref rend="bold">Evagrius of Pontus</ref> and
                  <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>). In the mid-7th cent., Sabrishoʿ Rustam,
               while head of the monastery of Beth Qoqa, wrote a biography of Abraham, which has not
               survived (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, vol. 3.1, 454–5).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Syriac writing containing the legendary correspondence between Jesus and King Abgar
               of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, the report of the apostle Addai’s mission to Edessa
               and of the city’s christianization, and the story of the finding of the Cross by
               Protonike, the wife of emperor Claudius. Towards the end, the text claims to have
               been written by Labubna, the king’s scribe, and to have been deposited in the royal
               archives at Edessa.</p>
                    <p>An earlier and shorter version of part of this story exists in the first book (I,13)
               of the Greek Ecclesiastical History of <ref rend="bold">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref>
               (written in the late 3rd and early 4th cent.), who mentions a Syriac document from
               the archives of Edessa as his source. In Eusebius’s text Addai is known by the name
               Thaddaios (Thaddeus), and some of the details of the later story, such as the
               portrait of Jesus, are missing. Eusebius’s account ends after Abgar is healed and
               Thaddaios is asked to speak to the people of Edessa, a prelude to the city’s
               conversion. The Ecclesiastical History was translated into Syriac around 400. The
               exact relationship between Eusebius’s text and the early 5th-cent. <hi rend="italic">Teaching</hi> remains somewhat unclear, and several expansions of the <hi rend="italic">Teaching</hi> obviously belong to the 4th and 5th cent.</p>
                    <p>Eusebius’s claim of a written source appears plausible, which implies that the kernel
               of the story was composed, at the latest, towards the end of the 3rd cent. What is
               remarkable, however, is the paucity of outside corroboration for this story. In the
               approximately 100 years between Eusebius’s work and the Teaching, no mention is made
               of this story in Syriac sources. The complete silence of <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>,
               who spent the last ten years of his life in Edessa, as well as of the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, a mid-6th-cent. composition that includes important
               information on 4th-cent. Edessa, is particularly striking. The earliest affirmation
               of the story is by Egeria, who mentions it in her Latin travelogue (383–84). It is
               only after the <hi rend="italic">Teaching</hi>begins to circulate that Syriac sources
               begin to reference the story.</p>
                    <p>The origins of the story are difficult to discern. The most plausible theory takes
               into account the heterogeneous nature of the earliest Christianity in Edessa. In the
               2nd and 3rd cent. Edessa was home to many competing groups, as the followers of <ref rend="bold">Marcion</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Mani</ref>, a ‘proto-orthodox’ group, and others all vied for authority. The story
               most likely originated inside one of these groups fighting for both supremacy and
               authenticity. Whatever is the case, the group that later became dominant and
               represented orthodox Christianity perpetuated the story in order to substantiate its
               claim as the true faith.</p>
                    <p>The story’s popularity reveals its importance for later Syriac Christianity.
               Accordingly, Syriac Christianity could trace its roots all the way back to the
               apostles and to Jesus himself. Also significant is the connection that the story
               establishes between Edessa, <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, and Rome, thus linking the
               nascent Edessene church to Christianity in the Roman Empire.</p>
                    <p>An interesting subplot surrounds the portrait of Christ in the <hi rend="italic">Teaching</hi>. While this portrait does not occur in Eusebius, and is only
               briefly mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Teaching</hi> as a portrait painted by
               Ḥannan, the tabularius, it later became famous in Byzantine Christianity. From the
               late 6th cent. onwards, the portrait was said to have been ‘made not by human hands’.
               In 944, the portrait was taken to Constantinople and became an icon of great
               importance. There is no trace of it after the sack of Constantinople by the Crusaders
               in 1204.</p>
                    <p>The full Syriac text of the Teaching is preserved in one early ms., which was written
               probably in Edessa around 500 (nowadays in the library of St. Petersburg), while
               extracts exist in a few other mss. In the 5th cent., the Syriac text was translated
               into Armenian; in the ensuing centuries the legend became fully part of Armenian
               historiography. There are also translations into Arabic. From Arabic it found its way
               into Ethiopic, where it enjoyed great popularity.</p>

                    <p>Classical Adiabene, Syriac <hi rend="italic">Ḥadyāb</hi>, refers to the region
               between the Upper and Lower Zab rivers, from the Tigris in the west to Mt. Ṣalāḥ
               al-dīn (= Mt. Pirmum) in the east. Its main city was the ancient Assyrian Arbaʾil
               (modern Arbīl), seat of Ishtar of <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref>, goddess of war and
               collaborator in the creation of humans. Ḥazzā, the name referring to Adiabene in
               Arabic sources, was an earlier center of the region, located some 12 km. southeast of
               Arbīl. The impressive citadel of Arbela contains remains from the Neolithic period to
               modern times, including Sasanian, Christian, and Islamic levels in between. Arbaʾil
               was a caravan city on a trade route linking southern Mesopotamia and Persia with
               Palestine and Egypt, as shown in an Aramaic letter signed by Arshama, the Achaemenid
               satrap of Egypt (late 5th cent. BC). During the 1st cent. AD the local royal family
               converted to Judaism, under Izates, who enjoyed quite a remarkable reign according to
                  <ref rend="bold">Josephus</ref> (‘Antiquities’,20.17–94). Christianity spread into
               this region quite quickly, with Papa possibly serving as its first metropolitan as of
               310. The Synod of 410 held in <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> declared
               Adiabene a metropolitan seat, occupied in that year by Daniel. Thereafter, Adiabene
               grew into a great administrative province of the Ch. of E., though it suffered
               several persecutions, especially under Shapur  II (309–379). The jurisdiction of the
               metropolitan of Adiabene was not restricted to his own province but extended at one
               point to include Azerbaijan and <ref rend="bold">Nineveh</ref>, divided into nine
               suffragan dioceses. When <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> grew in political and economic
               importance at the beginning of the 9th cent., it separated from Adiabene, but the
               latter continued to be a Metropolitan see until the beginning of the 17th cent. By
               the end of the 18th cent. most of Adiabene joined the Catholic uniate movement, and
               Arbela fell under the jurisdiction of the Chaldean archbishop of Kirkuk.</p>

                    <p>Greek author of animal fables which came to enjoy a very wide popularity in numerous
               forms and languages. Three related Syriac collections survive, a standard collection
               with 64 fables, in a number of mss., but a larger one in a single ms. with 83 fables,
               and a third collection with only 10; Aesop’s name was corrupted into ‘Iosipos’ and
               identified as <ref rend="bold">Josephus</ref>in the ‘Catalogue’ of <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>. The Syriac translation has been variously dated between the 9th
               and 11th cent. It subsequently came to circulate in Jewish circles in Hebrew
               characters (attributed to ‘Sophos’), and in the 11th cent. a Greek translation was
               made by Michael Andreopoulos in <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref>; in this the author’s
               name came to be given as Syntipas (the Syriac <ref rend="bold">Sindbad</ref> having
               been translated at the same time).</p>
                    <p>In the Life of Aesop, written in Greek (1st cent. AD), sections 101–23 draw heavily
               on the story of <ref rend="bold">Aḥiqar</ref>, evidently available in Greek (now
               lost).</p>

            narrative set in the Assyrian court.<note/>

                    <p>Aḥiqar, ‘the Aramean Sage’ who is mentioned in an Akkadian text, is the hero of a
               narrative set in the Assyrian Court: as the Minister of Sennacherib (705–681 BC) and
               Esarhaddon (680–69 BC), he instructs his nephew Nadan by means of wise sayings, so
               that in due course he might succeed him; Nadan, however, is impatient and plots to
               have the Assyrian king put Aḥiqar to death, but a friend hides the Sage and only
               reveals that he is still alive when the Assyrian king is put to a challenge by the
               Egyptian Pharaoh. Aḥiqar is produced and solves the riddling challenge; he then
               proceeds to give Nadan a second set of instructions, this time admonitory in
               character.</p>
                    <p>A collection of sayings by Aḥiqar, and a narrative concerning him, is already known
               in Imperial <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref> in fragmentary form from a papyrus from
               Elephantine (south Egypt) dated to the 5th cent. BC (the recent identification of the
               erased under-text as a customs document concerning shipping cargos, dated 475 BC,
               provides a <hi rend="italic">terminus post quem</hi>); here the king is Esarhaddon.
               Very probably the sayings and the narrative once circulated independently in slightly
               different dialects, but in their combined form they have proved very influential over
               the course of time in many different languages, and they have continued to be read up
               to the present day. In the Hellenistic period Aḥiqar is mentioned by name in the book
               of Tobit (1:21–2; 2:10; 11:19; 14:10, 15), and traces of the work have been found in
               Egyptian Demotic. It must also have been translated into Greek, since ‘Akikharos’ is
               mentioned by several Greek authors, and much of the narrative has been reused in the
               Greek Life of <ref rend="bold">Aesop</ref> (probably 1st cent.); furthermore, a lost
               Greek translation must lie behind the subsequent translations into Old Slavonic and
               Romanian.</p>
                    <p>Five recensions of the Syriac form of the Story are preserved, and these evidently go
               back to a lost older Syriac text which will have been the basis for the Armenian
               version (which in turn was the source for the Georgian and Old Turkish translations),
               and for the Arabic adaptations (sometimes under the name of Luqman). The Ethiopic
               translation derives from Arabic, and the Modern Syriac versions, though based on
               Classical Syriac, also show some influence from Arabic forms of the Story.</p>

                    <p>Exegete from <ref rend="bold">Beth Qaṭraye</ref> mentioned by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ
                  bar Brikha</ref>. According to Assemani he lived around 990. Cowley suggests
               identifying this Aḥob with Ayyub, ‘the interpreter of Seleucia’, who lived at the end
               of the 6th cent. His main argument is that <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>
               (9th  cent.) has quoted Aḥob. In all likelihood Christianity had already disappeared
               from the Beth Qaṭraye region by the beginning of the 10th  cent.; therefore, it would
               indeed seem wise not to date him much later than other important scholars from Beth
               Qaṭraye such as <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ</ref>,
               and <ref rend="bold">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref>. Assuming that Cowley is right, Aḥob was
               born in Qaṭar and must have migrated to <ref rend="bold">Seleucia</ref>. The Chronicle
               of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref> states that he was considered for election as Cath. in
               581, when <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb</ref> was chosen.</p>
                    <p>ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha’s ‘Catalogue’ credits Aḥob with an ‘Elucidation of the whole New
               (Testament), of the Pentateuch and all the Prophets, in addition to (or: except for)
               an elucidation of the Beth Mawtbe (i.e. Josh., Judges, 1–2 Sam., 1–2 Kings, Ruth, and
               wisdom books)’. These works have not been handed down to us: the New Testament
               commentary Baumstark suggested to attribute to Aḥob is lost (ms. Siirt 27). We do
               have quotations in later authors, however.</p>
                    <p>The Genesis part of the Anonymous Commentary on the Pentateuch (9th/10th cent.)
               contains two references to Aḥob, according to some of the manuscripts. Especially
               important are the quotations in the Commentary on Psalms ascribed to <ref rend="bold">Denḥa</ref> (9th  cent.?), partly in the margins and partly in the text itself.
               Some of these present the exegesis of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>.
               The parallels between Aḥob and Ishoʿdad of Merv can be explained by assuming that
               Ishoʿdad used Aḥob, but not the other way round. Aḥob was an important source for
               Ishoʿdad’s alternative readings of the biblical text, especially the readings
               attributed to ‘the Hebrew’. The 19th-cent. mss. (ms. Mingana Syr. 58 and ms.
               Cambridge Or. 1318, among others) containing the Denḥa commentary also include a Book
               on the cause of the Psalms of Mar Aḥob Qaṭraya. Mingana and Vosté’s attribution to
               him of yet another treatise, a classification of the Psalms, is probably incorrect,
               however.</p>
                    <p>Fragments of Aḥob were also quoted by <ref rend="bold">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043) in
               his biblical commentaries in Arabic, whence they found their way to Ethiopia, where
               they were first translated into Ethiopic and later received a place in the Amharic
               Andemta commentary tradition. Further references to Aḥob can be found in <ref rend="bold">Bar Bahlul</ref>’s Lexicon and in <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq Shbadnaya</ref>’s
               prose commentary on his own Poem on the Divine Government of the World from the
               Creation to the Consummation (15th cent.).</p>

                    <p>Author of a work on human physiology. He is almost certainly to be distinguished from
               the metropolitan <ref rend="bold">Aḥudemmeh of Balad</ref>; but may be (so Gignoux) the
               bp. of <ref rend="bold">Nineveh</ref> of this name, listed amongst those present at the
               Synod of 554. Two different works ‘On the composition of man’ are attributed to
               Aḥudemmeh. The first (ed. Nau) is preserved in a single W.-Syr. ms. of the 9th cent.
               and is evidently incomplete, while the second (ed. Chabot) is found in an E.-Syr. ms.
               of 1904, and is attributed to ‘Aḥudemmeh Antipatros’; according to Chabot this is not
               by Aḥudemmeh but a work by the 2nd-cent. doctor Antipater, not preserved elsewhere.
               The ms. of 1904 continues with a short anonymous text on man as a microcosm, which
               could be by Aḥudemmeh (so Gignoux, who also considers the previous text to be by the
               6th-cent. Aḥudemmeh; he also draws some parallels with Middle Persian sources, and to
               similar material in <ref rend="bold">Shemʿon d-Ṭaybutheh</ref> and in <ref rend="bold">Gewargis Warda</ref>’s poem on Man as a Microcosm, ed. Gignoux, 1999).</p>
                    <p>Probably yet a third Aḥudemmeh was the author of a grammatical work, mentioned by
                  <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref>.</p>

               Durand) that the original was Greek (and the work is listed in <hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 3340), it is almost certainly a translation from Syriac. The theological
               phraseology makes it very unlikely that the work really belongs to the first half of
               the 4th cent. (thus Bruns), and it would best fit sometime between 410 and 428 (thus

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Italian humanist, belonging to the earliest generation of Syriac scholars. He became
               Doctor of Canon and Civil Law in Pavia, his native city. After receiving the Holy
               Orders and joining the Canons Regular of Saint Augustine, Albonesi went to Rome,
               where Cardinal Bernardino López Carvajal, on behalf of Pope Leo X, commissioned him
               to examine the Syriac version of the Maronite missal. Thus Albonesi made the
               acquaintance of the three delegates of the Maronite patriarch to the Fifth Lateran
               Council (1512–17): the priest Joseph Kūri (Acurius), the deacon Moses, and the
               subdeacon Elias bar Abraham (from whose hand came the first Syriac mss. to enter the
               Vatican Library). At that time Albonesi knew no Syriac, but he had studied Hebrew in
               Rome with some Jewish scholars, among whom were Joseph Zarfati, Abraham of Balmes,
               and a certain ʿAbdias (perhaps ʿObadiah Sforno, Reuchlin’s teacher). Zarfati, who,
               like the Lebanese envoys, spoke Arabic, served as an interpreter, allowing the
               translation of the Syriac missal into Latin via Arabic and Italian (the product of
               this enterprise is found in codex Estensis α.R.7.20 in Modena). Albonesi returned to
               his hometown with the knowledge of Syriac that he had gained by studying under
               Elias’s guidance and with a ms. of the Syriac Psalter that he intended to publish.
               Both the ms. and the types he had produced were, however, destroyed during the sack
               of Pavia on the part of the French army of François I (1527). The unexpected finding
               of his lost ms. among the wrapping paper of a sausage-maker in Ferrara reportedly
               prompted Albonesi to rebuild his typography and to devote himself to the preparation
               of that which he meant to be an introduction to the edition of the Syriac Psalter.
               The book, entitled <hi rend="italic">Introductio in Chaldaicam linguam, Syriacam
                  atque Armenicam, &amp; decem alias linguas…</hi> (‘Introduction to Chaldean,
               Syriac, Armenian, and ten other languages…’, Pavia, 1539), was finally printed by
               Giovanni Maria Simonetta. The previous year Guillaume Postel had already
               xylographically reproduced, in his <hi rend="italic">Duodecim characteribus
                  differentium alphabetum…</hi>(Paris, 1538), two brief Syriac texts. Albonesi’s <hi rend="italic">Introductio</hi>, however, despite some graphic inaccuracies,
               presented for the first time in Europe a substantial amount of information about the
               Syriac language, as well as Syriac texts of some length. Albonesi was also
               instrumental in igniting Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter’s interest in Syriac.
               Widmanstetter, whom Albonesi met in Reggio Emilia in 1529, would eventually publish,
               along with <ref rend="bold">Mushe of Mardin</ref>&gt;, the first edition of the NT
               Peshitta (Vienna, 1555).</p>

                    <p>City in northern Syria and an important center of Christianity in the Middle East
               today as the seat of a total of nine bishoprics (Syr. Orth., Syr. Catholic, Chald.,
               Maron., Melk. Orth., Melk. Catholic, Armenian Orth., Armenian Catholic, Latin).
               Aleppo, nicknamed ‘Grey Aleppo’ (<hi rend="italic">Ḥalab al-šahbāʾ</hi>) in Arabic,
               owes its military and commercial importance to its imposing citadel and its favorable
               position on the trade route linking the nearby Mediterranean coast with Mesopotamia
               and areas beyond. Aleppo’s history goes back at least to the second millenium BC. The
               earliest known names of Aleppo are cognates of the modern name ‘Ḥalab’, but Seleucus
               Nicator (d.  281  BC) who founded a Greek colony here named it after ‘Beroea’ in
               Macedonia, and it is by that name that Aleppo is normally known in older Syriac
               literature. Aleppo came under Roman rule in 64 BC. After the Arab conquest in 636,
               Aleppo first rose to prominence under the Ḥamdānid Sayf al-Dawla (945–67). Aleppo
               later became the seat of lines of Zangids (1129–83) and Ayyūbids (1183–1260). Aleppo
               was taken by the Mongols in 1260 and a little later by the Mamlukes. Under the
               Ottomans (1516–1918), Aleppo became the capital of a province covering much of
               today’s northern Syria and a significant part of Turkey (including <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, Alexandretta/Iskenderun, and ʿAintab/Gaziantep). For much of that
               period, it was the third largest city in the Ottoman Empire after Istanbul and Cairo,
               and the Christians, including Syr. Christians, as well as a larger number of Melkites
               and later an increasing number of Armenians, then played an important role in the
               life of the city, one noteworthy member of the Aleppine Syr. Catholic community from
               the period being the world-famous chess player Philip Stamma (ca. 1705–55). Aleppo is
               today the largest city in Syria with a population of ca. 1.7 million (2.85 million in
               the larger conurbation, in 2008).</p>
                    <p>The first known bp. of Aleppo is Eustathius, who became Patr. of Antioch and attended
               the Council of Nicaea in that capacity. Bp. Peter of Aleppo was a supporter of <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> at the Synod of Sidon in 511, while Bp.
               Antoninus was among the Miaphysite bishops exiled with <ref rend="bold">Severus of
                  Antioch</ref> under Emperor Justin.</p>
                    <p>The first known Syr. Orth. bp. after the reorganization of the church in the mid-6th
               cent. is Matthew (644–669). Among his successors was <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>
               (ca. 1253–64), who was the bp. there when the city fell to the Mongols in 1260.
               Little is known about the Syr. Orth. community in the subsequent period until the
               beginning of the 16th cent., when we first hear of a Syr. Orth. (later Syr. Catholic)
               church of the Mother of God in the Christian quarter of Judayda (Jdeideh), and we
               find Aleppo included, along with <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref> and Ḥama, in the title
               of Metr. <ref rend="bold">Grigorios Yawseph the Iberian</ref> of <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> (metr. 1515–37). From the second half of the 16th cent. onwards,
               we frequently hear of visits to Aleppo by Syr. Orth. patriarchs, including Ignatius
               Pilatus I (Patr. 1591–97) who died and was buried in Aleppo. The Syr. Orth. community
               in Aleppo, reduced to a small number through large-scale conversions to the Syr.
               Catholic Church since the latter half of the 18th cent., was reinforced in the 20th
               cent. by refugees fleeing the atrocities in areas now in the Republic of Turkey.
               These refugees included a group from <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, who migrated to
               Aleppo en masse in 1924, as well as those from the area around <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>.</p>
                    <p>As a center of Latin missionary activity since the beginning of the Ottoman era, with
               Capuchins, Jesuits and Carmelites present in the city by 1526, Aleppo played an
               important role in the formation of the <ref rend="bold">Syriac Catholic Church</ref>.
               Andrew Akhījān (Patr. 1662–78) worked and was elected Patr. in Aleppo, while Michael
               Jarweh (Patr. 1782–1800) was born in Aleppo and was Metr. of Aleppo prior to his
               elevation to the patriarchate. The central role Aleppo continued to play in the life
               of the Syr. Cath. Church is reflected in the fact that five out of the thirteen
               successors of Michael Jarweh have been natives of Aleppo (Michael Ḍāhir, Peter
               Jarweh, George Chelhot, Antony Ḥayek, Peter ʿAbd al-Aḥad), while two others were
               Metr. of Aleppo before ascending to the patriarchate (<ref rend="bold">Ignatius Ephrem
                  Raḥmani</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Gabriel Tappuni</ref>).</p>
                    <p>The E.-Syr. see of Aleppo is attested in the 11th cent. and is also mentioned as a
               suffragan of Damascus in a list of bishoprics appended, in a 13th-cent. ms., to the
               canonical works of Elias of Damascus (ca. 900), but it was probably extinct by the
               13th cent. Nothing is then heard of the E.-Syr. presence in Aleppo until the 17th
               cent. The Chald. diocese of Aleppo, founded as a patriarchal vicariate in 1901 and
               raised to the status of an eparchy in 1957, today covers the whole of Syria.</p>
                    <p>The presence of an early Maronite community in Aleppo in 727 is recorded in the
               Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>. Significant presence of Maronites in
               the modern period dates from the 17th cent., with Maronite bishops regularly resident
               in the city since 1686. Aleppo played an important role in the life of the Maronite
               Church as one of her few urban centers, and the Maronite school there produced such
               men as the three founders of the Maronite Aleppine Order (later Mariamites) and the
               scholar-bishop Germanus Farḥāt (bp. of Aleppo 1725–32). The Maronite woman mystic
               Hindiyya al-ʿUjaymī was born in Aleppo in 1720.</p>
                    <p>In the first decade of the 20th cent., there were reported to be approximately
               35,000–40,000 Christians in the city, making up about one third of the total
               population and including: 3,500 Syr. Catholics (4,000 in the diocese), 50 Syr. Orth.
               (500 in the diocese), 250 Chald. and 3,600 Maron. (Karalevsky); as well as 1,200
               Melk. Orth., 10,000 Melk. Catholics, 15,000 Armenian Orth., 5,500–7,000 Armenian
               Catholics, 1,100 Latins and 1,500 Protestants (Tournebize). The numbers reported
               today for the Syriac dioceses of Aleppo are: Syr. Orth. 15,000 (in 2003, Zinda
               Magazine); Syr. Catholic 8,000 (in 2006, <hi rend="italic">Annuario pontificio</hi>);
               Chald. 15,000 (in 2006, <hi rend="italic">Annuario pontificio</hi>, for whole of
               Syria); Maron. 4,000 (in 2006, <hi rend="italic">Annuario pontificio</hi>). The
               actual numbers (esp. for the Chaldeans) will have been increased significantly by
               those fleeing insecurity in Iraq since 2003.</p>
                    <p>Little is known about the sites of the medieval Syriac churches in Aleppo. The
               churches dating from the Ottoman period are found in the traditional Christian
               quarter in Judayda just north of the medieval city. These include the Melkite and
               Armenian churches concentrated in the Ṣalībat al-Judayda Quarter, as well as the Syr.
               Catholic Church of Mār Āsyā al-Ḥakīm (formerly Mother of God) a little to the east,
               and the Maronite Cathedral of Mar Eliya to the north. A  number of newer churches,
               including the Syr. Catholic Cathedral (Umm al-Intiqāl/Assumption, 1970), are found in
               the ʿAzīziyya District to the north of Judayda. The Chaldean Cathedral and the Syr.
               Orth. Cathedral of Mar Ephrem lie further north in Sulaymāniyya. Further churches
               belonging to the Syriac communities are found in the ‘Old Syriac Quarter’ (Ḥayy
               al-Suryān al-Qadīm) just behind the railway station to the northwest of the city
               center, a quarter established by migrants from Edessa (Mār Jirjis, Syr. Orth.; Mār
               Afrām, Syr. Catholic), and in the ‘New Syriac Quarter’ (Ḥayy al-Suryān al-Jadīd)
               further northwest (Sayyidat al-Suryān ‘Our Lady of the Syriacs’, Syr. Orth.).</p>
                    <p>Important collections of Christian Arabic and Syriac mss. are found in Aleppo at the
               Maron. Archiepiscopal Residence (over 1640 mss.), Fondation Georges et Mathilde Salem
               (most of Sbath Collection, no. 777–1321, and some additional mss.), Syr. Catholic
               Archiepiscopal Residence (ca. 500 mss.) and Syr. Orth. Archiepiscopal Residence and
               Church of Mar Jirjis (including the collection transferred from Edessa, ca. 225
               mss.), as well as at the Melk. Catholic Archiepiscopal Residence (ca. 1,100
               mss.).</p>
                    <p>A large number of ruined Byzantine churches are found in the so-called ‘Dead Cities’
               in the hills to the west of Aleppo, including the ruins of the huge basilica built
               around <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>’s pillar at Qalʿāt Simʿān (approx. 30
               km. west-northwest of Aleppo).</p>

                    <p>The exploits of Alexander the Great (356–23 BC) gave rise to a very large number of
               works, in many different languages. The three main works concerning him in Syriac
               are:</p>
                    <p>1. A translation of Pseudo-Callisthenes, (based on the Greek recension <hi rend="italic">delta</hi>), preserved in a number of late E.-Syr. mss. (ed. with ET
               by Budge). According to Nöldeke, this was not translated directly from Greek, but by
               way of a lost Middle Persian version; this view has, however, been recently
               challenged by Ciancaglini, who points to strong evidence that it was made directly
               from Greek. The Syriac version includes a visit by Alexander to <ref rend="bold">China</ref>, which is an episode absent from all other texts. There is also a
               Modern Syriac version.</p>
                    <p>2. A narrative poem on Alexander attributed to <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>,
               but dating almost certainly from soon after the emperor Heraclius’s victory over the
               Persians (629/30). The different recensions are edited by Reinink (ET in Budge,
               163–200).</p>
                    <p>3. A christianized legend of Alexander entitled ‘The exploits of Alexander’. This is
               found in the mss. of the Syriac version of Pseudo-Callisthenes (and is included in
               Budge’s edition) and, in a somewhat different, but related, form, in the <ref rend="bold">Zuqnin Chronicle</ref>. This too is thought to date from shortly after
               629/30. According to van Bladel (2008), this provided the source for the section on
               Alexander in the Qurʾān.</p>
                    <p>Other Syriac texts relating to Alexander are:</p>
                    <p>4. A short life, preserved in a single ms. of the 8th/9th cent. (ET in Budge,
               159–61).</p>
                    <p>5. Sayings attributed to Alexander, preserved in various sources, including <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s Amusing Stories.</p>
                    <p>6. A set of short laments over Alexander, said to have been uttered by various
               philosophers. These are also found in Arabic, in the Annals of Eutychius (ca.
               935).</p>
                    <p>7. An account of Alexander’s encounter with the Brahmin Dandamis (an excerpt from
                  <ref rend="bold">Palladius</ref>’s ‘On the Peoples of India and on the
               Brahmins’).</p>
                    <p>8. Various notices in Chronicles.</p>
                    <p>9. Ms. Vat. Syr. 555 (W.-Syr., dated 1501) contains an astronomical ‘Book of
               Alexander’.</p>

                    <p>Town 40 km. north of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> in Iraq. Seat of a Chald. bishopric.
               It now numbers around 5,000 inhabitants. Many families and individuals migrated from
               Alqosh to larger Iraqi cities (Mosul, <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>, etc.) or abroad,
               especially to the USA and UK. The town’s economy is based on agriculture (wheat,
               barley, chickpeas, lentils, beans, cucumbers, gourds, melons, grapes, and figs) and
               animal husbandry (sheep and goats). Traditional trades included weaving and dying
               cloth. Alqosh is a major spiritual center. Jews used to go on pilgrimage to the tomb
               believed to be that of the prophet Nahum, who, according to an interpretation of Nah
               1.1, may have come from Alqosh. Two important E.-Syr. monasteries lie close to
               Alqosh: the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Rabban Hormizd</ref>, founded in the
               7th   cent., used to be one of the patriarchal residences of the Ch. of E., later
               moved to Mosul, then Baghdad, and the more recent Monastery of the Virgin, also known
               as ‘the Lower Monastery’ or ‘of Our Lady of the Seeds’. From the 16th cent. the
               cultural life of the village flourished thanks to the so-called <ref rend="bold">School
                  of Alqosh</ref>. Alqosh was pillaged several times, by Murād Bey (Bar Yak) in
               1508, the Pasha of ʿAmadiyya in 1740, the Persians in 1743. People sought refuge on
               the mountain, in the Monastery of Rabban Hormizd, but there were rapes and
               casualties. Around the mid-16th cent. some of the population supported <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref>, the first Chald. Patr. elected with official approval of
               Rome. In 1767, around 100 of the 500 families were Catholic. Literary sources and
               annotations made by European travelers record recurrent cases of pestilence and
               famine, caused by draught or locusts, which devastated the region during the 19th
               cent. In 1832 and 1842 the village was attacked and pillaged by Kurds.</p>

                    <p>City in upper Mesopotamia. Situated on high ground on the right bank of the Tigris
               and surrounded by massive black basalt walls, which later gave it the nickname ‘Black
                  (<hi rend="italic">kara</hi>) Amid’, Amid was by the 4th cent. a key point in
               Rome’s defence of her eastern frontiers and became the most important city in the
               Roman province of Mesopotamia after the cession of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> to
               the Persians in 363. It was taken by the Persians in 359, 503, and 606/7. After the
               Arab conquest in 639, it was ruled by a series of dynasties including the Kurdish
               Marwānids (984–1085), and the Turkmen Īnālids (1097–1183), Ḥisn Kayfā Artuqids
               (1183–1230) and Aq Qoyunlu (1401–1507), dynasties which at one point or another made
               Amid their chief seat. After being taken by the Ottomans in 1515, Amid became the
               administrative center of a province that covered most of northern Mesopotamia from
               Manzikert in the north to Sinjar in the south. It is today a provincial capital and
               the largest city in the Turkish part of Mesopotamia with a population of over half a
               million. The name Diyarbakır (Arabic <hi rend="italic">Diyār Bakr</hi>), which
               originally referred to the region around Amid, came to be used for the city in
               Ottoman times and was officially adopted in 1937, replacing the older name which goes
               back to Assyrian ‘Amedi’.</p>
                    <p>Amid was evangelised at an early date, no doubt from <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>. The
               first known bp. of Amid, Simeon, is said in a late source to have attended the
               Council of <ref rend="bold">Nicaea</ref>. His successors include Acacius, celebrated
               for his ransoming of Roman soldiers taken captive by the Persians in 423/4, as well
               as Asterios and Shemʿon, the only bishops from the province of Mesopotamia to attend
               the councils, respectively, of Ephesus and Chalcedon. The area around Amid was an
               important center of monasticism with five monasteries within the city by 525 (<ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>, Ecclesiastical History, VIII.5). Well-known
               monasteries in the immediate vicinity include those of 1. the Edessenes (4th cent.,
               probably on a site just south of the city wall); 2. Yoḥannan Urṭaya (4th cent., north
               of the city wall), where <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> spent his youth; and
               3. Zuqnin, the home of the <ref rend="bold">Zuqnin Chronicle</ref>. Of importance at a
               later date was the Monastery of Prophet Elijah near the village of Qanqart, ca. 8 km.
               southwest of Amid (attested 11th–19th cent.).</p>
                    <p>In the period after the Council of Chalcedon, Amid was a Miaphysite stronghold, and
               Bp. Mara of Amid was one of those bps. expelled from their sees under Emperor Justin
               I. After a period of persecution for the Miaphysites under the Chalcedonian Bp.
               Abraham bar Kaili, a line of Miaphysite bishops was reestablished with the
               consecration of Eunomius in ca. 546. Among the later occupants of the see was <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>. Amid has been the seat of the Syr. Orth.
               patriarchs on several occasions, including a period in the 11th cent. after Dionysios
               IV (1032–42) took refuge in the then Marwānid city to escape persecution in Byzantine
                  <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref>, during the tenure of Ignatius <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdullāh I bar Sṭephanos</ref> (1521– 1557), and in 1862–71 when Ignatius Yaʿqub
               II (1847–1871) took up residence in the Yoldat Aloho Church in the wake of
               disturbances in <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>. The Syr. Orth. see of Amid lapsed with
               the demise of Metr. Dionysios ʿAbd al-Nūr Aslan in 1933.</p>
                    <p>The presence of E.-Syr. Christians in Amid is suggested by the inclusion of ‘Amid’ in
               the titles of bishops of Maypherqaṭ from the 12th cent. onwards. The first Chald.
               patriarch, <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref>, resided in Amid after his return
               from Rome in 1553. Later, Amid became the residence of a new line of Chald.
               patriarchs from Yawsep I (1681–96) to Yawsep V (Augustin Hindi, 1781–1828). The
               Chald. see of Diyarbakır, vacant after 1923, was revived in name in 1966, with
               residence, however, in Istanbul and jurisdiction over the whole of Turkey (vacant
               since 2005 as of going to press).</p>
                    <p>Syriac Christians originally constituted the majority of the Christian population,
               but came to be outnumbered by the Armenians under Ottoman rule. The Melkite
               community, which had been Syriac-speaking in pre-Islamic times, dwindled after the
               Arab conquest, but was reinforced by migrants from <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> in the
               17th cent. According to a census conducted in 1870, the city had a population of
               21,372, with 9,814 Muslims, 6,853 Armenian Orth., 831 Armenian Catholics, 1,434 Syr.
               Orth., 174 Syr. Catholics, 976 Chald., 305 Melk. Orth., 55 Melk. Catholics, 650
               Protestants and 280 Jews. In 1908, <ref rend="bold">Naʿʿūm Fāʾiq</ref> published there
               the first number of his journal <hi rend="italic">Kawkbo d-madnḥo</hi>. In 1914, the
               Syriac population of the city is reported to have stood at 8,000, and that of the
               thirty or so nearby villages (including Kaʿbiya, Sharukhiya, Qarabash, Quṭurbul, ʿAyn
               Tannūr/Ali Pınar) at 6,450. Though greatly diminished by the massacres during the
               First World War, a sizeable Christian community remained until relatively recently,
               with the Syr. Orth. community still numbering nearly 1,000 individuals in the early
               1960’s. In 2005, the city had one resident Syr. Orth. priest and 7 Syr. Orth., 2
               Chald., and 2 Armenian families.</p>
                    <p>Of the older churches in the city, two, both of them former patriarchal residences,
               remain in regular use: 1. Yoldat Aloho (Syr. Orth., in Lāle Bey Quarter, in the
               southwest section of the old city, 3rd/6th cent.?), with the main church of Yoldat
               Aloho and that of Mor Yaʿqub adjoining it to the north and housing the relics of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>; 2. Mar Petion (Chald., in Özdemir Quarter, east
               of main crossroads). (An Evangelical church opened opposite Yoldat Aloho in 2003).
               Still in situ are: St. George’s (in the citadel, 4th cent.?), Latin (Capuchin, in
               northeast section of old city, 17th cent.), Protestant (southeast) and Armenian
               Catholic (southeast) churches, as well as the Armenian Orth. churches of Surp Giragos
               (adjoining Mar Petion to the east, 16th cent.) and Surp Sarkis (southwest, 16th
               cent.) and chapel of Surp Hagop. Two churches were demolished in the 20th cent.: 1.
               Cosmas and Damian (east of Yoldat Aloho, 4th cent.?, Melk. in modern period); 2. the
               Syr. Cath. Church (northeast, 7th cent.?). Among the churches mentioned in historical
               records, the one built by Emperor Heraclius in 628/9 was probably a Syr. Orth.
               Church, which is to be distinguished from the Melk. church (called St. Thomas?)
               occupying the site of the present Great Mosque (see Palmer). Other known churches
               (some of them possibly identical with those already mentioned) include: St. John the
               Baptist (place of burial, in 649/50, of Bp. Yuḥanon of the Arabs), St. Stephen
               (converted to fire temple in 503), Mor Zʿuro (near Urfa Gate, before 503; burial
               place, in 649/50, of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of the Sedre</ref>and Shemʿun of
               Edessa), Mor Shilo (built by Bp. Mara ca. 520), St. Theodore (northeast, Armenian in
               16th cent.) and Mor Ḥananyo (southeast?). Kırklar Dağı ‘Hill of the Forty’, to the
               south of the city, is probably the site of the Church of the Forty Martyrs built by
               Yuḥanon Soʿuro of Qarṭmin (bp. of Amid 483/4–502), who was responsible also for the
               construction of the nearby Tigris bridge.</p>

                    <p>Patr. of the Maronites, author of a Syriac grammar. Born in Ehden, Lebanon, ʿAmīra
               was sent to Rome in 1583, to study at the newly founded Maronite College (1584). Upon
               his return to Lebanon he was ordained priest, immediately followed by his
               consecration as bp., in 1596. In 1634 he was elected patr. Belonging to the first
               generation of Maronite ecclesiastical leaders trained in Rome, he was instrumental in
               bringing the Maronite Church further in line with the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
                    <p>His significance for Syriac studies lies in the fact that he is the author of a Syr.
               grammar, which he wrote during his stay in Rome and which was published in 1596: <hi rend="italic">Grammatica syriaca, sive chaldaica</hi>. After <ref rend="bold">Andreas Masius</ref>’s publications, which were the first to provide systematic
               descriptions of the Syriac language in Europe (1571), and which served as models for
               some later scholars, ʿAmīra produced an entirely independent grammar, which in
               comparison with Masius’s work was based on a larger corpus of texts, paid more
               attention to the indigenous Syr. tradition, and included more discussion of
               syntactical problems (Contini). A partial French translation by J. F. de la Croix was
               made in 1681 (apparently unpublished). With the exception of some translations from
               Latin into Syriac for the Maronite Missal (published in Rome between 1592 and 1594),
               ʿAmīra did not publish any other Syriac work. His Arabic publications are all related
               to his pastoral and church-administrative work as bp. and patr.</p>

                    <p>The town of Amyūn is situated 20 km. south of Tripoli<ref rend="bold"/>(Northern
               Lebanon), on the road between Chekka and Kousba, built on a high, rocky cliff rising
               above the plains of olives and fruit orchards watered by the Qadisha river. This
               citadel has a long history. Early neolithic burial graves are still visible in the
               rock walls towering over the lower town, and fragments of classical carving are built
               into the walls of the houses along narrow, medieval streets. During the period of the
                  <ref rend="bold">Crusades</ref>, the town belonged to the Seigneury of Besmedin, a
               branch of the Seigneury of Giblet (Jbeil or Byblos). Several medieval churches still
               function in the town.</p>
                    <p>The Church of Mar Phocas, which is nowadays Greek Orthodox, has a simple
               barrel-vaulted nave, a deeply recessed apse and two side-aisles, separated by heavy
               stone piers with pointed arches. Like many of the medieval Lebanese churches, it was
               built over the foundations of a classical temple. Only a few fragments of fresco
               decoration survive, and these are mostly from different periods and differing styles
               indicating different hands.</p>
                    <p>In the apse are the scant remains of an Anastasis painting. Parts of Christ’s flying
               cloak are visible as he pulls Adam out of the grave. Behind Adam is Eve, and behind
               her is Abel. On the other side are David and Solomon, and the remains of a scroll
               once held by John the Baptist. Above the head of Christ is a little flying angel.</p>
                    <p>Below the apse, in the lower zone, are eight apostles on either side of Sts. Peter
               and Paul. Most of these saints are too damaged to be identified.</p>
                    <p>On the northern wall, near the apse, is a large portrait of St. Philip, with the
               small figure of a donor at his side, also called Philip. On the same wall, toward the
               west, are the remains of <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref> between two
               standing saints and two flying angels. The large piers of the church are decorated on
               all four sides with remains of paint, showing several saints, a portrait of St.
               Simeon the Younger Thaumaturgos, a portrait of the standing St. Phocas, Christ
               Pantocrator, and an equestrian St. Theodore spearing a dragon.</p>
                    <p>These wall paintings are all inscribed in Greek. Some attempt has been made to write
               in Syriac over a long inscription in the lower zone of the apse, with the unfortunate
               result that neither the original Greek, nor the later Syriac is legible.
               Stylistically, the apse painting and the tall portrait of St. Philip closely resemble
               contemporary wall paintings in 12th-cent. Cyprus. The wall paintings on the piers
               show at least two layers of paint, and whereas the bottom layer is most likely 12th
               cent., the top layers belong to the 13th.</p>

               refers to its strategic function as an arsenal of victuals and weapons for the
               fortified places along the western frontier. The earliest reliable information comes
               from the historians Ammianus Marcellinus (XXIV 2,9–22; d. ca. 395) and Zosimus (III
               17,3–18,6; ca. 500). Ammianus saw the city (<hi rend="italic">Piri-sabora</hi>) with
               his own eyes during the campaign of Emperor Julian. He describes it as large and
               populated, with a citadel and a double wall. Zosimus reports that the city (<hi rend="italic">Bērsabōra</hi>) was second in rank after the Sasanian capital
               Ctesiphon. During the first centuries of Islam, al-Anbār remained prosperous, being
               the residence of the Abassid Caliphs al-Saffāḥ (750–54) and al-Manṣūr (754–75) until
               the latter moved to the new capital Baghdad (762). The city declined until the end of
               the first millennium; in 1262 it was sacked by the Mongols.</p>
                    <p>Al-Anbār was a see of the Ch. of E., first mentioned in the 5th cent. The main
               sources (surveyed by J.-M. Fiey) are the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref> and
               the ‘Book of the Tower’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-majdal</hi>, ed. H. Gismondi).
               Several bps. are known, the last known was consecrated in 1111. Three of them bacame
               Cath.: Ṣliba Zka (713–28), Theodosios (853–58), and Yoḥannan bar Narsai (884–91).
                  <ref rend="bold">Eliya of al-Anbār</ref> was elected Patr. in 937, but failed to
               receive the Caliph’s approval. There were two monasteries in al-Anbār: St. Quryaqos
               and the famous one of Mar Yonan. The Jewish community in al-Anbār (probably identical
               with Pumbedita) was founded in the 4th cent. It was one of the largest in Babylonia
               (the sources are surveyed by A. Oppenheimer). A second Peruz Shapur is on the eastern
               bank of the Tigris near the Khabur inflow.</p>

               Jerusalem) and, until 1953, Latin patriarchs. Antioch is situated at the foot of Mt.
               Silpius in the valley of the Orontes, approximately 25 km. from the Mediterranean
               coast. Founded by Seleucus I Nicator ca. 300 BC and named after his father Antiochus,
               Antioch grew rapidly as the capital of the Seleucids. For the Romans who took it in
               64 BC it was their largest and most prosperous city in Asia. Antioch was taken by the
               Sasanians for the first time in 256, when Shapur I deported many of its citizens and
               settled them in, among other places, the city he named ‘Better is the Antioch of
               Shapur’, the later Gondeshapur (<ref rend="bold">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>). After its
               destruction by Khusrau I in 540, the city was rebuilt on a smaller scale by
               Justinian, only to be attacked again by the Persians at the beginning of the 7th
               cent. and occupied by them for over a decade from 611. Antioch was captured by the
               Arabs in 637/8. Under the Byzantines again in 969–1084, it was taken by the Crusaders
               in 1098. The Frankish Principality of Antioch lasted until 1268, when it was
               conquered by the Mamluks. A minor provincial town under the Ottomans and the French
               mandate, Antioch became the capital of the short-lived Republic of Hatay in 1938
               before being incorporated, together with the rest of the former district (sancak) of
               Alexandretta, into the Republic of Turkey in 1939.</p>
                    <p>The Apostle St. Peter and St. <ref rend="bold">Ignatius of Antioch</ref> are reckoned
               as the first and third bishops of Antioch, and it is after them that it later became
               customary for the Maron. patriarchs to adopt the name ‘Peter’ and the Syr. Orth. and
               Syr. Catholic patriarchs the name ‘Ignatius’. The city in which St. Paul preached and
               the followers of Jesus were first called ‘Christian’ soon became the most important
               center of Christianity in Asia, and its see was recognised as ranking alongside those
               of Rome and Alexandria at the Council of Nicaea. The area under the ecclesiastical
               jurisdiction of Antioch that later became known as ‘patriarchate’ largely coincided
               with the civil diocese of the ‘East’ (Oriens) — whence the title ‘of Antioch and All
               the East’ still born by the patriarchs  — corresponding roughly to the parts of
               today’s Turkey south of the Taurus, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Holy Land, the
               last of which later formed a separate Patriarchate of <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem
               </ref>(although this was recognized only by the Chalcedonian churches). The
               theological school at Antioch which flourished in the 4th and 5th  cent. was to have
               a major influence on the theology of the Ch. of E. through the writings of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> and others. Antioch was one of the major
               battlegrounds in the Christological controversies of the 5th and 6th cent. that led
               to the formation of the Syriac Churches as separate entities from the Imperial
               Church. Among the patriarchs of Antioch resident in Antioch, John I (428–42) was a
               supporter of <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref>, while Peter the Fuller (468–86, with
               interruptions) and <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> (512–18, d. 538) were
               important proponents of the Miaphysite teaching.</p>
                    <p>Since the expulsion of Severus by Emperor Justin the Syr. Orth. patriarchs have
               usually been unable to reside in, or even visit, their titular see, except on such
               occasions as when Caliph Yazīd II allowed Eliya  I (709–24) to make a solemn entry
               into the city and consecrate a new church there in 721, and during the Crusader
               period, when the Frankish rulers and Latin clergy of the city tended to favor the
               non-Chalcedonian Christians as their allies against Muslims and Melkites. From that
               period we know of a forced sojourn in Antioch of Athanasios (1090–1129) in ca. 1115,
               as well as of more friendly visits by <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> (1166–99),
               who is said to have been enthroned on the chair of St. Peter during one of his visits
               in 1168–69, by Ignatius III Dawid (1222–52), who built a residence for himself on the
               outskirts of the city some time before 1246, and by <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon bar
                  Maʿdani</ref> (1252–63), who was enthroned on the ‘chair of Great Severus’ in
               1253. The Syr. Orth. had three churches in the city in 1170 (Yoldat Aloho, Mor
               Giwargis and Mor Barṣawmo). The visit to Antioch by Patr. Ignatius Zakka Iwas in 2000
               was probably the first by a Syr. Orth. patriarch since the 13th cent.</p>
                    <p>In the 1920s there was a small community of Maronites in Antioch, who together with
               the Latin rite Christians numbered about fifty, alongside larger communities of
               Melkites numbering some 4,500 and Armenians numbering 400 in a total population of
               20,000–30,000. Today, the city still has functioning Melk. Orth. and Latin churches.
               St. Peter’s Church, or Grotto, the cave believed to be the site of the first church
               in Antioch, lies about 2 km. to the northeast of the town center.</p>
                    <p>The Black Mountain (the Amanus Range) to the northwest of Antioch was a renowned
               center of monasticism. A number of Syriac liturgical mss. copied there attest to the
               continued use of Syriac alongside Greek and Georgian by Melkite monks in the region
               in the 11th cent.</p>

                    <p>Author of uncertain date, designated ‘rhetor’ and ‘philoponos’, according to a ms.
               colophon from the family of Gurgin (<hi rend="italic">d-beth Gurgin</hi>), and a
               monk. Nothing is known of him apart from his works and a brief report in the
               Ecclesiastical History of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> to the effect that he
               lived at the time of the patriarch <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref>
               (active in 825), a view which Bar ʿEbroyo declares to be generally accepted by his
               contemporary teachers and elders. Bar ʿEbroyo supports this by identifying an unnamed
               student of Greek poetry in Anṭun’s ‘Rhetoric’ with Dionysios’s brother <ref rend="bold">Theodosios of Edessa</ref>, translator of the poems of <ref rend="bold">Gregory of
                  Nazianzus</ref>. The 9th-cent. dating of Anṭun has thus not gone uncontested.
               Mention of his works by later authors first appears in <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub bar
                  Shakko</ref> and Bar ʿEbroyo.</p>
                    <p>Two mss. in London (Brit. Libr. Add. 17,208 + Dayr al-Suryān 32 and Brit. Libr. Add.
               14,726) contain all his known shorter writings and fragments of his major work, a
               treatise on rhetoric. The shorter writings comprise a substantial work ‘On Divine
               Providence’, notable not least for its knowledge of medicine, a treatise ‘On the
               Myron’, in its prologue largely identical with that by <ref rend="bold">Mushe bar
                  Kipho</ref> and probably dependent upon Pseudo-Dionysius, eight poems (five in
               letter form), and four liturgical hymns.</p>
                    <p>His most significant work is his treatise on rhetoric, in five books. Apart from the
               London fragments, the older mss. have perished or are now in a location difficult to
               access, but some copies were made from the late 19th cent. and have survived. These
               copies preserve the text in full, with the exception of the final part of the fifth
               book. The treatise is unique in Syriac literature, with the exception of its partial
               reproduction and paraphrasing in the ‘Book of Dialogues’ of Yaʿqub bar Shakko. It was
               greatly admired by Bar ʿEbroyo, who cited it frequently in his ‘Book of Splendors’
               and prefaced it to the ‘Organon’ of <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref> in the curriculum
               of ‘external’ (i.e. secular) works he wished to see studied in the schools.</p>
                    <p>The main importance of the work lies in the evidence it provides of a rhetorical
               tradition in Syriac which has clear points of contact with the Greek (see <ref rend="bold">Rhetoric</ref>). It is most unlikely that Anṭun knew Greek, but he
               mentions having had a teacher in the reading of Homer, and much of the treatise can
               only be understood on the supposition that a considerable amount of Greek rhetorical
               theory had been incorporated into Syriac teaching. The work is also remarkable for
               the range of authors cited in it as rhetorical examples. For Anṭun, as for Greek
               Christian rhetors, Gregory of Nazianzus was the supreme model of eloquence, but Anṭun
               was proud of his Syriac heritage, and in his eyes Gregory shared this position with
                  <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, whose poetry also belonged to the sphere of rhetoric.
               In addition to many Greek and Syriac Christian authors, several pagan writers are
               cited, including Homer, Plutarch, Heliodorus, and an unknown Evodius and (Aramean)
               Wapha. Anṭun also exhibits knowledge of the Platonic political-philosophical concept
               of the philosopher-king, a concept which was also important in the thought of
               al-Fārābī, the great Muslim philosopher who studied with Syro-Arabic Christian
               Aristotelian philosophers in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> in the 10th cent.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>One of the earliest Hellenistic city foundations in Syria, Apamea, situated on the
               Orontes ca. 90 km. south of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, from the 2nd cent. onwards
               was an important center of Middle- and Neo-Platonist philosophy. Both Numenius (late
               2nd cent.) and Iamblichus (early 4th cent.) taught here.</p>
                    <p>In the first half of the 5th cent., the region of Apamea was home to the ascetic
               circle around <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>. An important bp. of Apamea
               during Yoḥannan’s lifetime was Polychronius, the brother of <ref rend="bold">Theodore
                  of Mopsuestia</ref>, whose biblical commentaries, written in Greek (not preserved)
               are sometimes quoted in the later Syriac tradition.</p>
                    <p>In the late 5th and the 6th cent., Apamea and the province of Syria Secunda, of which
               it was the capital, became divided between supporters and opponents of the Council of
               Chalcedon (451). The tension between the two groups can be clearly sensed from the
               correspondence of <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref>, who during his tenure as
               Patr. (512–18) had difficulty imposing his authority on the diocese. Eventually Syria
               Secunda was instrumental in bringing about the restoration of Chalcedonian Orthodoxy
               in the Eastern Empire under the emperors Justin I (518–27) and Justinian (527–65).
               The Monastery of <ref rend="bold">St. Maron</ref>, in the Apamea region (although the
               exact location is not known), which was perhaps at the head of a confederation of
               like-minded monasteries, played an important role in these 6th-cent. developments.
               The Chalcedonian convictions of the monks of Saint Maron gradually became
               disconnected from Melk. (Byzantine) orthodoxy and, from the 7th cent. onwards, gave
               rise to the emergence of an independent branch of Chalcedonian Syriac Christianity,
               which later became known as <ref rend="bold">Maronite</ref>. For the Maronites, the
               Apamea region is their cultural and monastic homeland, from which several centuries
               later, they transferred their ecclesiastical center to Lebanon.</p>
                    <p>Apamea had several churches, along with a synagogue (uncovered below one of the
               churches). Parts of mosaic floors are preserved. While the primary language of Apamea
               was Greek, an important Syriac inscription, mentioning Bp. Peter of Apamea (and dated
               to the year 827 ‘in the reckoning of the Apamaeans’, i.e., 515/16) was discovered at
               Maʿar Zayta (a small town to the southwest of Maʿarrat al-Nuʿmān). At a short
               distance from Apamea lies the town of Huarte, in which several churches were
               uncovered, along with a Mithraeum, underneath one of the churches. Some 50 km. north
               of Apamea is the likely place of origin of the famous <ref rend="bold">Rabbula
                  Gospels</ref>, with their extraordinary illuminations.</p>
                    <p>Apamea was abandoned in the early Islamic period and later fell into ruins. In 1930,
               a team of Belgian archeologists started excavating it. Interrupted during World War
               II, and resumed only in 1965, the excavations during the past several years have been
               under the direction of J.-Ch. Balty.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Syriac author of 23 ‘Demonstrations’, known as ‘the Persian Sage’. The name Aphrahaṭ,
               by which he is known today, is first found in <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (d.
               828). In the early 8th cent. <ref rend="bold">Giwargi, bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>
               only knew of him as ‘the Persian Sage’ (V. Ryssel, <hi rend="italic">Georgs des
                  Araberbischofs Gedichte und Briefe</hi>[1891], 44–54), though the oldest ms. of
               his works (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,182, dated 474) names the author ‘Yaʿqub,
               the Sage of Persia’. Confirmation of Yaʿqub as his name comes from the early Armenian
               translation and from the Latin author Gennadius (ca. 500), though both have
               mistakenly taken him to be bp. <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> (d. 338), which
               is impossible, since the Demonstrations are provided with exact dates: 1–10 are dated
               to 336/7, 11–22 to 343/4, and 23 to August 345. They were clearly written in the
               Persian Empire, and by a person in some sort of authority (the late identification of
               him as a bp. of <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> is baseless). The first group
               deals largely with ascetic topics, and Dem. 6–7 are particularly important witnesses
               to the role of the <ref rend="bold">bnay qyāmā</ref> and <ref rend="bold">iḥidāye</ref>
               in the Syriac proto-monastic tradition. Many of the second group concern Judaism and
               are aimed to combat Judaising tendencies among Christians. The long Dem. 14 stands
               apart, being described as a letter addressed to the bishops, priests, and people in
                  <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>. Dem. 21 has as its background Shapur II’s
               persecution. The final Dem. 23 provides a reply to certain questions posed to the
               author concerning the ‘blessing hidden in the cluster of grapes’ (Isaiah 65:8). The
               Demonstrations constitute the first major literary work in Syriac: the opening words
               of Dems. 1–22 provide an alphabetic acrostic, and several Demonstrations contain
               lengthy passages of carefully balanced artistic prose. Besides their literary
               interest, the Demonstrations are of great importance for the light they shed on many
               different topics, in particular: the character of Christianity in the Persian Empire
               and its ascetic developments, relations with Judaism, the early stages of Shapur’s
               persecution, and the history of the Syriac biblical text, together with its exegesis
               and Christology.</p>
                    <p>The Demonstrations are preserved in four mss., three of which date from the 5th and
               6th cent. The 5th-cent. Armenian translation (1–19, attributed to Yaʿqub of Nisibis),
               was first published in 1756, over a century before the Syriac became known. There are
               translations of individual Demonstrations into Arabic (parts of 2–4, 6, 9; attributed
               to <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>), Ethiopic (5, 8; attributed to Yaʿqub of Nisibis),
               and Georgian (6; attributed to <ref rend="bold">Hippolytus</ref>).</p>

                    <p>Apocalypses, or Revelations, aim to disclose eschatological events and in order to
               enhance their authority they are often attributed to past authorities; sometimes it
               is an angel who makes the disclosure. Such works tend to be produced at times of
               crises in society.</p>
                    <p>Two Apocalypses are transmitted in the great Milan ms. of the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> OT (7a1), the ‘Revelation of Baruch’ and ‘The Book of Ezra the
               Scribe who is called Shelathiel’ (usually referred to as IV Esdras); both are edited
               (by S. Dedering and R. Bidawid) in <hi rend="italic">Vetus Testamentum Syriace</hi>
               IV.3 (1973). Lections from both works are sometimes found, indicating their
               quasi-canonical authority. Both Apocalypses are of Jewish origin and are usually
               dated ca. AD 100; their original language was probably Hebrew. The Revelation of
               Baruch survives complete only in Syriac and an Arabic translation (ed. F. Leemhuis,
               A. F. J. Klijn, G. J. H. van Gelder, 1986) made from Syriac (a few fragments only are
               known in Greek); by contrast, IV  Esdras (confusingly also called II Esdras in modern
               translations of the Apocrypha/Deuterocanonical books) is also known in Latin,
               Armenian, Coptic (a fragment), Ethiopic, and Georgian; the intermediary Greek,
               however, is lost.</p>
                    <p>The NT Apocalypse of John is not part of the Peshitta canon, but two later W.-Syr.
               translations were subsequently made, one in the 6th cent. (ed. J. Gwynn, 1897, repr.
               2005), the other ca. 615, by <ref rend="bold">Ṭumo of Ḥarqel</ref> (photographic ed.,
               A. Vööbus, CSCO 400, 1978). Older printed editions of the Peshitta NT include the
               Ḥarqlean version, while more recent ones give the 6th-cent. version. The book only
               occasionally received a commentary (notably by <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar
                  Ṣalibi</ref>).</p>
                    <p>The Apocalypse of Paul purports to describe what Paul saw when he was raised to the
               ‘third heaven’ (2 Cor 12:2), and how he was given a tour of both paradise and the
               place of punishment. The work, which was originally written in Greek (ed. K.
               Tischendorff, <hi rend="italic">Apocalypses Apocryphae</hi> [1866, repr. 1966],
               34–69), proved to be immensely popular, and was translated into many languages,
               including Syriac (ed. G. Ricciotti, in <hi rend="italic">Orientalia</hi>2 [1933],
               1–25, 120–49; ET by J. Perkins, <hi rend="italic">JAOS</hi> 8 [1866], 183–212). It
               has usually been thought that the earliest form of the Apocalypse goes back to the
               3rd cent., and that a ‘second edition’ was later issued, claiming that it had been
               discovered in a house in Tarsus in 388 (or possibly 420). More recently it has been
               proposed that the supposed ‘second edition’ was in fact the original form of the
               Apocalypse. The Syriac translation places the Tarsus narrative at the end, and has a
               preface by the translator at the beginning. The edition of a variant Syriac version
               is being prepared by A. Desreumaux. The Coptic Apocalypse of Paul, found at Nag
               Hammadi is a different work (ed. with FT, J.-M. Rosenthiel, 2005).</p>
                    <p>The turbulent political events of the 7th cent. gave rise to a number of texts of an
               apocalyptic nature, this time all composed in Syriac. The Persian invasion of the
               eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire, capturing <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>
               in 614 and the relic of the Cross, followed eventually by Heraclius’s successful
               compaigns and recovery of the Cross (630), probably provide the scenario for a poem
               (transmitted in three different forms) on Alexander the Great ‘and the Gates of the
               North’, attributed to <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, but evidently composed
               between 630 and 636 (ed. with GT, G. J. Reinink, CSCO 454–5, 1983; ET in E. A. W.
               Budge, <hi rend="italic">The History of Alexander the Great</hi>[1889, repr. 1976],
               163–200). This draws on a christianized form of the <ref rend="bold">Alexander</ref>
               legend from not long before 630 which proved very influential (Budge, <hi rend="italic">History of Alexander</hi>, 144–58 [ET], 255–75 [Syr.]).</p>
                    <p>Another Apocalypse making use of the theme of the ‘Gates of the North’ is the Syriac
               Apocalypse of Daniel (ed. with ET, M. Henze, 2001; ed. with Esperanto tr., M.
               Slabczyk, 2000). This work is completely different from the Greek Apocalypses of
               Daniel; Syriac is clearly its original language and parts of it are parallel with
               another Syriac apocryphon, the ‘Young Daniel, concerning the End’ (ed. H. Schmold,
               Ph. D. Diss., Hamburg; 1972). The lack of any indication of contemporary events,
               prior to ‘the End’, make it difficult to date these works, but the first half of the
               7th cent. seems likely.</p>
                    <p>A <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> ‘On the End’, wrongly attributed to <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Sermo</hi> III.5; ed. E. Beck, CSCO 320–1, 1972),
               which also makes use of the christianized Alexander legend, has been dated to ca.
               640, soon after the Arab conquests, though it could alternatively come from a few
               decades later in the 7th cent. The unrelated Latin sermon ‘on the End’, also
               attributed to Ephrem, is probably later than the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius.</p>
                    <p>The Second Civil War (683–92) and the plague of 686–7 gave rise to the inclusion of a
               number of apocalyptic features in the final book 15 of <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan bar
                  Penkaye</ref>’s ‘Book of the Main Points’, written ca. 687 in north Mesopotamia.
               The apocalyptic preface to the <ref rend="bold">Testament of our Lord</ref>, translated
               by Yaʿqub (probably, of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>) in 686/7 will also date from
               that time if the preface was indeed the work of the translator.</p>
                    <p>The immensely influential <ref rend="bold">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</ref>,
               attributed to the bp. of that name who was martyred in 312 very probably dates from
               691/2, the time of ʿAbd al-Malik’s tax reforms and the building of the Dome of the
               Rock (ed. with GT G. J. Reinink, CSCO 540–1, 1993; ET in P. J. Alexander, <hi rend="italic">The Byzantine Apocalyptic Tradition</hi>[1985], 36–51; partial ET in
               A. Palmer, <hi rend="italic">The seventh century in the West-Syriac chronicles
               </hi>[1993], 230–42). This draws on themes found in the <ref rend="bold">Cave of
                  Treasures</ref>, the <ref rend="bold">Julian Romance</ref>, and the Alexander
               legend, and foretells, in eschatological terms, the end of Arab rule. Related to
               Pseudo-Methodius, but from slightly later, is the ‘Edessene Fragment’ (ed. F. Nau, in
                  <hi rend="italic">JA</hi> 11.9 [1917], 415–71; ET in Palmer, <hi rend="italic">The
                  seventh century</hi>, 243–50); following the example of Pseudo-Methodius, it draws
               further on the Julian Romance, and also on the legend of Queen Helena and Judas
               Quryaqos, for its portrayal of the Last World Emperor on Golgotha. The apocalyptic
               section in the <ref rend="bold">Gospel of the Twelve Apostles</ref> attributed to John
               ‘the Little’, is thought to date from much the same time.</p>
                    <p>The extended apocalyptic section in the legend of Bḥira (see <ref rend="bold">Sargis
                  Bḥira</ref>) probably dates from about the mid-9th cent. in its present form, but
               its roots may go back to the end of the reign of Maʾmūn (813–33).</p>
                    <p>‘The Question asked by Ezra in the desert with his disciple Carpus concerning the end
               of the times of the Ishmaelites’ (ed. with GT, F. Baethgen, in <hi rend="italic">ZAW</hi> 6 [1886], 193–211; ed. with FT, J.-B. Chabot, in <hi rend="italic">Revue
                  sémitique</hi> 2 [1894], 242–50, 333–46) has been ascribed to many different
               dates, ranging from the 7th to 11th/12th cent. An Ethiopic version (unpublished) is
               also known.</p>
                    <p>The composition of pseudepigraphical apocalypses could also be for the purpose of
               personal ambition, as is indicated by a passage in <ref rend="bold">Michael
               Rabo</ref>’s Chronicle (XI.22) where he tells how Quryaqos bp. of Segestan and Bar
               Salta of <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref> composed an ‘Apocalypse of Enoch’,
               foretelling the reign of Marwān (II) and his son, which they presented to Marwān in
               order to win his support in church affairs.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>and Cath. (484–495/6). Aqaq headed the
               Ch. of E. during a critical period of its history, when it adopted a strictly
               dyophysite Christology. Aqaq had studied at the <ref rend="bold">School of
               Edessa</ref>, where he became acquainted with the works of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of
                  Mopsuestia</ref>. Among his fellow students were <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref> and
                  <ref rend="bold">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref>. Aqaq’s predecessor, Cath. Babowai, who
               had a strained relationship with Barṣawma, had also come into conflict with the
               Persian Emperor Peroz and was arrested and executed by the latter in 484. When Aqaq
               took office, therefore, the situation of Christianity in the Persian Empire was
               extremely precarious. Our main source for the history of his period is the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. There is no evidence of Aqaq’s involvement in
               a synod held in <ref rend="bold">Beth Lapaṭ</ref> in April 484. This may have been a
               limited synod of Barṣawma’s followers, of which no report is transmitted (and which
               Barṣawma himself later revoked). It was in the wake of this synod that Babowai was
               arrested and executed, and replaced by Aqaq. At a subsequent synod, held in Beth
               ʿEdray, in August-September 485 (of which also no report is preserved), peace between
               Barṣawma and Aqaq was established. A number of letters from this period, included in
               the Synodicon, confirm that Barṣawma and his followers eventually submitted to Aqaq.
               The stage was thus set for the Synod of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, of Febr. 486, in which a
               unified church, under Aqaq’s leadership, adopted dyophysite Christology.
               Additionally, measures were taken to restrain the (excessive) influence of ascetics
               outside their monasteries and to make marriage the preferred status for all clergy,
               including bishops, celibacy being relegated only to monasteries. The specific context
               of these measures is not yet clear. Should they be understood in response to ideas
               prevailing in the Zoroastrian society, or as reactions to over-active wandering
               monks, who also may have propagated Miaphysitism among Persian Christians? Apart from
               the information in the Synodicon, very little is known about Aqaq. The Chronicle of
                  <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref> attributes to him a treatise ‘On faith’, written
               against the Miaphysites, and three discourses on fasting, none of which is preserved.
               The Chronicle also reports that Aqaq translated into Persian a treatise on the
               Christian faith by <ref rend="bold">Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye</ref>, which was presented to
               the Persian emperor Qawad.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Translation from Syriac into Arabic is a well-known phenomenon. This is especially
               true for the translations of philosophical and scientific works that were made in the
               first Abbasid period by <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> and others, which have
               been the object of significant scholarly research (see, e.g., Bergsträsser). Much
               less attention has, however, been paid to the opposite phenomenon: translations from
               Arabic into Syriac. It has even been suggested (by <ref rend="bold">Eliya of
                  Nisibis</ref> in his discussions with the vizier al-Maghribī) that the absence of
               such translations are proof of the superiority of Syriac science and culture. As a
               matter of fact, however, the Syrians already had translations from Arabic some time
               before Eliya. One may distinguish six different, unrelated fields:</p>
                    <p>1. The earliest category consists of ascetical and hagiographic material related to
               the life and spirituality of the monks from the Egyptian desert. Though most of these
               Syriac texts were translated from a Greek original (e.g the apophthegmata by <ref rend="bold">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>), at least a few seem to have had an Arabic original,
               which in its turn goes back to a Coptic Vorlage: a panegyric on John the Small by a
               monk of <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> and the biography of Shenute by his
               disciple Besa (10th cent.).</p>
                    <p>2. The second field covers a few writings pertaining to Syriac entertainment
               literature, such as the stories of <ref rend="bold">Kalila and Dimna</ref> (11th cent.,
               by an E.-Syr. priest, in addition to an earlier Syriac version made from Pahlavi in
               the 7th cent.), ‘<ref rend="bold">Sindbad</ref> the wise’,and the tale of the ‘Ten
               viziers and the son of King Azad-Bekht’.</p>
                    <p>3. The next category is constituted by medical texts of Greek origin, which were
               translated in the first Abbasid period. Though in most cases these texts were
               translated directly from the Greek original into Syriac (which served as the basis of
               a subsequent Arabic translation), there are a few instances in which Arabic served as
               the intermediary between Greek and Syriac. Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq mentions that his
               co-religionist Yūḥannā b. Māsawayh, the private physician of several caliphs,
               requested that Ḥunayn’s nephew Ḥubaysh translate into Syriac three medical works by
                  <ref rend="bold">Galen</ref>, which were already available in an Arabic version. We
               may assume that the reason behind this request was that the very critical Ibn
               Māsawayh held that Syriac was more appropriate than Arabic for expressing scientific
               idioms. A Syriac version of Ḥunayn’s Arabic treatise <hi rend="italic">al-Masāʾil
                  al-ṭibbiyya</hi>‘Book of medical questions’ is preserved in some late Chald. mss.,
               through there is no information about the translator (for discussion, see Teule,
               forthcoming).</p>
                    <p>4. <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> had a good knowledge of Muslim-Arabic literature.
               Many of his works can be characterized as sometimes literal, sometimes paraphrastic
               translations/adaptations of Arabic philosophical and religious writings, such as the
               ‘Ethicon’ and the ‘Book of the Dove’ (based on Ghazālī), the <hi rend="italic">Swād
                  supyā</hi> (based on Ibn Sinā), etc. In these cases, however, the author did not
               intend to make translations, and the origin of the source text was not revealed.
               Nevertheless, Bar ʿEbroyo did also compose several translations that were meant as
               such: the <hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-išārāt wa-al-tanbīhāt</hi> by Ibn Sīna (Syriac
                  <hi rend="italic">Ktobo d-remze wa-mʿironwoto d-Abu ʿAli bar Sīnā</hi>), in which
               he acknowledges the authorship of Ibn Sīnā and does justice to the Islamic context of
               this work, Athīr al-Dīn al-Abharī’s <hi rend="italic">Zubdat al-Asrār</hi> (lost),
               and possibly Ibn Sinā’s ‘Medical Canon’. Bar ʿEbroyo’s translation activities are to
               be understood in the context of the growing acceptance of Muslim cultural and
               religious influences characteristic of the so-called <ref rend="bold">Syriac
                  Renaissance</ref>.</p>
                    <p>In Bar ʿEbroyo’s writings, one can also find several quotations (in Syriac) from
               verses of the Qurʾān. We have no certainty about a complete Syriac translation of
               this work, but <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>gives literal translations of
               several <hi rend="italic">sūra</hi>s in his ‘Treatise against the Muslims’.</p>
                    <p>5. The most important category is composed of theological writings translated from
               Latin or other European languages into Arabic by Western missionaries (16th cent. and
               later) with the help of local Christians, which served as the basis for new
               translations into Syriac. Examples are the <hi rend="italic">Maḥzitā mriqtā</hi> ‘the
               Polished Mirror’ by the Chald. Patr. <ref rend="bold">Yawsep II</ref> (d. 1713), a
               Uniate apologetic treatise, translated by himself, in defense of the Primacy of the
               Pope, and the ‘Book of the Magnet’, a popular book of moral theology. The reason for
               these translations was that the Christian population under the authority of Yawsep II
               (Northern Mesopotamia) did not have sufficient knowledge of Arabic. This is
               explicitly mentioned by the Chald. priest Khidr from <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> (d.
               1751), who translated into Syriac Arabic versions of European works or original
               Arabic treatises composed by Maron. or Syr. Catholic authors. The priest Yawsep
               Abraham from Rāwandūz (1832) translated the <hi rend="italic">Mizān al-zamān</hi>
               ‘the Balance of Time’ an originally Italian work, which was popular in Uniate
               circles, as well as some other theological and spiritual treatises. He also made a
               Syriac translation (from Arabic) of the NT Catholic Letters. An Arabic work by the
               zealous defender of the Uniate cause, the Melk. author ʿAbdallāh Zākhir (d. 1748) is
               also extant in a Syriac translation, probably made in Mesopotamia (on the Trinity and
               Incarnation). This translation activity from Arabic substantially diminished in the
               19th cent., when the Chald. clergy had direct access to Latin and Italian theological
               writings.</p>
                    <p>6. Some modern works written by authors like Bp. <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon
                  Dolabani</ref> or Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Afram Barsoum</ref>(especially his
               history of Syriac literature, translated into Syriac under the title <hi rend="italic">Brule bdire</hi>) were translated from Arabic into Syriac.</p>

                </ab>
                <div type="body">
                    <p>The Aramaic language belongs to the Northwest Semitic subfamily within the larger
               family of Semitic languages. To the same subfamily belong among others Hebrew,
               Phoenician, and Ugaritic. Aramaic itself consists of a great number of language forms
               (and indeed languages), spoken and written in many different scripts over a period of
               3000 years. Aramaic always co-existed and interacted with other, related or
               non-related, languages. Among the Aramaic languages <ref rend="bold">Syriac</ref> is by
               far the best documented language. Geographically, Aramaic first was used in various
               locations of the ‘Fertile Crescent’, in Syria and Mesopotamia. It later spread all
               over the Middle East and well into Central Asia. From the 6th cent. BC to the 7th
               cent. AD, Aramaic, in a variety of interrelated language forms, or ‘dialects’, was
               the most widespread language of the Middle East, co-existing first with Old Persian
               (6th–4th cent. BC), and then with Greek (3rd  cent. BC – 7th cent. AD), and Middle
               Persian (3rd– 7th cent. AD). Under the dominance of Arabic and Islam, Aramaic lived
               on among various religious minorities, Syriac Christianity being the most important
               among them. In the third millennium AD, Aramaic and Syriac are used by a few million
               people — Christians, Jews, Samaritans, and Mandaeans — in liturgy, literature, and/or
               in spoken dialects in the Middle East, Southern India, and the worldwide
               diasporas.</p>
                    <p>Various scholarly attempts have been made at classifying the Aramaic languages. One
               among them, first proposed by J. Fitzmyer, and slightly adapted by S. Kaufman among
               others, has become widely used. It is based on a five-fold division of Aramaic
               linguistic history.</p>
                    <p>1. Old Aramaic (ca. 900 – ca. 600 BC). Aramaic was used by semi-autonomous <ref rend="bold">Aramean</ref> tribes in Syria, Palestine, and Mesopotamia. Royal and
               funerary inscriptions of the <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> region exhibit a relatively,
               but not entirely, unified language in the Phoenician sphere of influence, while the
               bilingual inscription of the Tell Fakhariyya statue (northeast Syria) points to an
               Akkadian linguistic and cultural context. The script is nearly identical to the one
               found in the Phoenician inscriptions, from which it was borrowed.</p>
                    <p>2. Imperial, or Official Aramaic (ca. 600 – ca. 200 BC). Already in the later days of
               the Neo-Assyrian Empire (following the loss of independence of the Aramean city
               states), Aramaic began to be used for trade and communication. The expansion of
               Aramaic went on in the Neo-Babylonian Empire and culminated in the ‘official’ status
               that Aramaic achieved (along with Persian and Elamite) in the Achaemenid Persian
               Empire (mid-6th cent. – 330 BC). Along with inscriptions, a great number of texts on
               papyrus, parchment, and ostraca have been unearthed in Egypt. They evidence the use
               of Aramaic in official documents issued by, and addressed to, the Persian
               administration, in correspondence of a more private character, and in literary
               compositions. The Aramaic documents in the biblical book of Ezra and their narrative
               framework represent the same type of language. The official use of Aramaic implied
               that there was a certain linguistic and orthographical standard, even if individual
               texts often deviated from it. This standard remained authoritative for several
               centuries after the fall of the Persian Empire. Its literary variant has been called
               ‘Standard Literary Aramaic’.</p>
                    <p>3. Middle Aramaic (ca. 200 BC – ca. 250 AD). First, there is the continued use of the
               earlier standardized language, in such texts as the Aramaic chapters of the biblical
               book of Daniel, the Aramaic portions of the Dead Sea documents, and the earliest
               layer of the Jewish Targumim, or translations of the Hebrew Bible (Targum Onkelos for
               the Pentateuch and Targum Jonathan for the Prophets). Second, there are corpora of
               Aramaic inscriptions, produced in the Nabataean Empire (which had Petra as its
               capital), and in the city states of Ḥaṭra, Palmyra, and <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>.
               These lost their independence in the 2nd and 3rd cent. AD. The languages of these
               places each slightly differ from one another and they are written in slightly
               different scripts, derived from the script used in the Persian period. Nabataean
               Aramaic exhibits features that are due to contact with Old North Arabian, which was
               widely spoken throughout the Nabatean Empire.</p>
                    <p>4. Late Aramaic (3rd cent. to ca. 1200 AD). From this period literary texts are
               preserved which received classical status in at least four different religious
               communities. At the same time, a clear distinction emerges between West-Aramaic and
               East-Aramaic dialects.</p>
                    <p>West-Aramaic texts were produced by Jews (Palestinian Targumim, Aramaic portions in
               the Palestinian Talmud and in the Midrashim, Aramaic compositions preserved among the
               Cairo Genizah documents  — many of the texts mentioned represent the Galilean Aramaic
               dialect), Samaritans (Targumim, hymns, and prose compositions); and Christians of the
               Jerusalem area (<ref rend="bold">Christian Palestinian Aramaic</ref>).</p>
                    <p>East-Aramaic texts were produced by Jews (parts of the Babylonian Talmud and Gaonic
               literature), Mandaeans (classical Mandaic literature), and Christians (Syriac). The
               status of Syriac has been somewhat disputed. While Syriac traditionally has been
               considered the westernmost of the East-Aramaic languages, some scholars now tend to
               classify it as a separate branch of late Aramaic. The language of <ref rend="bold">Mani</ref> and of the early Manicheans must have been close to Syriac, but next
               to nothing has survived.</p>
                    <p>Jewish Aramaic texts are written in the Hebrew square script, which itself is an
               adaptation of the earlier Aramaic script. Samaritan Aramaic is written in a separate
               script, which derives from the earlier Hebrew script. Christian-Palestinian Aramaic
               is written in a <ref rend="bold">script</ref> that is related to Esṭrangela, and
               Mandaic has its own script, likely derived from the Parthian/Late Iranian scripts. An
               interesting genre that existed across religious borders is that of the incantations
               written on ‘magic bowls’: texts that are very similar exist in Jewish (Babylonian)
               Aramaic, Mandaic, and Syriac (written either in Esṭrangela or in a different script,
               which has been called ‘Proto-Manichean’).</p>
                    <p>Each of these languages had its heyday in the pre-Islamic period, when the literary
               languages to a large extent reflected, and were nourished by, the spoken languages.
               In the Islamic period, when Arabic became more prominent, the literary languages
               gradually became disconnected from the waning spoken dialects, which survived in
               geographical and social isolation.</p>
                    <p>5. Modern Aramaic, or Neo-Aramaic (to the present day). While the classical
               languages, shaped and standardized in the previous period, continued to be
               transmitted and written — and do so up to the present day  — the spoken variants
               started having their own history, much of which went unrecorded. It is only in the
               17th cent. that some dialects began to be written for the first time. This happened
               in Northern Iraq with Modern Jewish Aramaic and with Modern Syriac (see <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref>), which was written in and around <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref>. In the 19th cent., under the impulse of American missionaries, a
               new literary language was created for the Christians of <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref>
               and its surroundings. First used for a new translation of the Bible, Literary Urmia
               Aramaic later was adapted and upgraded to serve as the vehicle of the <ref rend="bold">Assyrian</ref> identity. As such it is still used today among E.-Syr. Christians
               in the Middle East and in the worldwide <ref rend="bold">diaspora</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The modern spoken dialects are generally subdivided as follows:</p>
                    <p>a. West-Neo-Aramaic, spoken in Maʿlula and in a few neighboring villages to the north
               of Damascus by Christians (Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic) and by some Muslims.
               This language may be seen as an offshoot of West-Aramaic, described under 4. Some
               texts are available in contemporary scholarly transliterations.</p>
                    <p>b. Central-Neo-Aramaic, of which the main dialect is <ref rend="bold">Ṭuroyo</ref>,
               spoken in <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, mainly by Syr. Orth. Christians. The
               language is now widespread among the Syr. Orth diaspora. There have been a few
               attempts to write it down, most successfully among the Swedish communities (in Latin
               script).</p>
                    <p>c. North-East-Neo-Aramaic, spoken to the east of the Tigris, in Eastern Turkey,
               Persian Kurdistan, and Northern Iraq (north of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>) by both
               Christians and Jews. Due to massive relocation throughout the 20th cent., originally
               distinct languages have been mixed and cases of Koine formation have emerged. Here
               again, many speakers live in the diaspora; Jewish Aramaic lives on in Israel.</p>
                    <p>d. South-East-Neo-Aramaic, represented by much endangered Mandaic dialects, spoken in
               southern Iraq and western Iran.</p>
                    <p>Each of these many modern dialects carries its own cultural and religious tradition.
               Linguistically they share a number of features, particularly in the radical
               transformation of the verbal system. In the lexicon, many loanwords were borrowed
               from the surrounding languages along with phonetic, morphological, and syntactical
               features.</p>
                    <p>In the Syriac tradition the term <hi rend="italic">ārāmāyā</hi> (<hi rend="italic">oromoyo</hi>) is often used, along with <hi rend="italic">suryāyā</hi> (<hi rend="italic">suryoyo</hi>), to denote the Syriac language. Syriac rewriting of
               texts originally composed in other Aramaic languages may be found in the Aramaic
               sections of the Old Testament and in such texts as the story of <ref rend="bold">Aḥiqar</ref>. An awareness of an Aramean unity, based on the language (<hi rend="italic">leššānā</hi> / <hi rend="italic">lešono</hi>) and the written
               tradition (<hi rend="italic">seprā</hi> / <hi rend="italic">sepro</hi>), extending
               from the first Chaldean and Assyrian kings to the Christian Syrians, can be found in
               the second Appendix added to the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>,
               which deals with ‘the kingdoms that have been established in Antiquity by our race,
               (that of) the Arameans, namely the descendants of Aram, who were called Syrians or
               inhabitants of Syria’ (ed. J. B. Chabot, text in vol. 4, 748–51&#160;; FT in vol. 3,
               442–7). Among the present-day Syr. Christians the Aramaic heritage is particularly
               emphasized by the Syr. Orth.</p>

                    <note type="abstract">Arameans feature in the annals of the Assyrian kings for some four centuries (ca. 1100-700 BC), apparently having settled more or less all around the Fertile Crescent; the geographical term Beth Aramaye in Syriac sources reflects their presence in Babylonia as recorded in the Assyrian annals.<note/>

                    <p>Arameans feature in the annals of the Assyrian kings for some four centuries (ca.
               1100–700 BC), apparently having settled more or less all around the Fertile Crescent;
               the geographical term <ref rend="bold">Beth Aramaye</ref> in Syriac sources reflects
               their presence in Babylonia as recorded in the Assyrian annals. In the course of the
               10th cent. BC a number of small independent Aramean kingdoms, using <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref> in their inscriptions, emerged in what is today Syria, though over
               the course of the next two centuries they all became subject to the Assyrian Empire,
               a fate shared with Israel and Judah. The often hostile relations between the Aramean
               kings and those of Israel and Judah are related in the OT (Kings and Chron.). Syriac
               readers of the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>, however, would have known these (with
               the exception of Rezin) as ‘Edomites’, rather than ‘Arameans’, since the Syriac
               translators evidently thought that the Arameans lived only to the East of the
               Euphrates (thus Laban remains an ‘Aramean’, Gen. 31:20). In the Peshitta NT, by
               contrast, ‘Aramean’ renders ‘Hellene’ in the sense of ‘gentile, pagan’ (e.g. Acts
               21:28; Rom. 1:16). At some point a distinction was introduced between the two senses,
               ethnic (<hi rend="italic">ārāmāyā</hi>) and pagan (<hi rend="italic">armāyā</hi>);
               the first definite attestation for the latter is in a <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> by
                  <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (ed. Bedjan, V, 474) where the
               three-syllable form is demanded by the meter (<hi rend="italic">armāyā</hi> is the
               vocalization that is later provided for all the NT passages).</p>
                    <p>In many Syriac writers <hi rend="italic">Ārāmāyā</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Suryāyā</hi> are synonyms; normally this refers to the language, but on occasion
               they are used as alternate ethnic terms: thus in the early Syriac translation of <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref>’s ‘Ecclesiastical History’ <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>
               is described both as a <hi rend="italic">suryāyā</hi> (ed. Wright, 183) and as an <hi rend="italic">ārāmāyā</hi> (243). Likewise <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>,
               in his ‘Encheiridion’ and elsewhere, speaks of ‘we Suryāye, or Ārāmāye’. This
               equation is further elaborated in Appendix II to <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>’s
               Chronicle. In modern times the ethnic identity of ‘Aramean’ has been taken up in some
               circles of the W.-Syr. <ref rend="bold">diaspora</ref> as a corrective to the
               popularity of <ref rend="bold">Assyrian</ref> themes.</p>

                    <p>Capital of modern Kurdistan, in eastern Iraq. It was already inhabited in the 4th
               millennium BC; in the oldest cuneiform texts it is called <hi rend="italic">Urbilum</hi> (Assyrian <hi rend="italic">Arbaʾilu</hi>). One of the stations
               along the royal road between Sardes and Persepolis, it was a cultic center, with a
               temple devoted to the fertility goddess Ishtar, as well as a center of commerce and a
               main point on the caravan routes. It was held successively by the Babylonians,
               Persians, and Greeks, and it was very near Arbela that Darius III was defeated by
               Alexander the Great (331 BC). It was during Alexander’s rule that the country
               surrounding Arbela became known as <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref> (Syr. <hi rend="italic">Ḥadyāb</hi>), which later became part of the Parthian Empire, and
               eventually a governor’s seat during the Sasanian period. In the 1st cent. AD,
               Adiabene became an independent kingdom, subject to the Parthian king, but it remained
               on the periphery of the battle zone between Rome and Parthia. It was in Adiabene,
               according to <ref rend="bold">Josephus</ref>, that the royal family converted to
               Judaism in the 1st cent. AD.</p>
                    <p>Arbela was christianized at a very early date and its inhabitants quickly became the
               victims of persecution by the local governor. The history of its Christian beginnings
               is recounted in the Chronicle of Arbela, a late and dubious mélange of biographical
               sketches of the twenty early bishops of Arbela (ca. 104–511). According to this
               Chronicle, Pekhida, a disciple of Addai, became the first bp.; during the tenure of
               Isḥaq, the third bp., the first church in Arbela was built. The Chronicle also bears
               testimony — and this may be the most historical witness of this text — that many of
               Arbela’s bishops and faithful suffered martyrdom at the hands of the Persians. The
                  <ref rend="bold">Acts of Mari</ref>, a seemingly more reliable source, claims rather
               that Aggai and Mari, missionaries from <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, were the first
               evangelists of Adiabene, and its first bps. Arbela was for some time the metropolitan
               seat of the region of Adiabene, and boasted of several important figures as bishops —
               of whom three later became patriarchs  — who appear in the signatory lists of the
               synods of the Ch. of E. A Christian school located in Arbela also produced a number
               of important monastic figures and bps. In 1295, a second Mongol invasion destroyed
               the Christian churches, killed many Christians, and drove the surviving Christians
               into other regions. Subsequent persecutions were sufficiently harsh that, by the end
               of the 17th cent., there were no remaining Christians in Arbela; small groups had
               begun to re-immigrate in the early part of the 20th cent.</p>

                    <p>Greek Philosopher. In Late Antiquity the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle were
               considered to be in harmony, and not in conflict; accordingly the syllabus for
               studying philosophy began with Aristotle (commencing with his logical works, the
               ‘Organon’, or ‘Tool’), leaving Plato to the climax. This accounts for the fact that
               the early books of the ‘Organon’ (‘Categories’, ‘On Interpretation’, and ‘Prior
               Analytics’ [at first only to I.7]) were the first works of Aristotle to be translated
               (along with <ref rend="bold">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Introduction’), and it is only these
               that actually survive, although there is evidence that much more was translated; it
               also accounts for the fact that no genuine works by Plato were ever translated into
                  <ref rend="bold">Syriac</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The Syriac translations fall into three main periods: 1. the earliest, anonymous,
               translations probably belonging to the early 6th cent.; these survive, and are
               confined to the early books of the ‘Organon’; 2. the 7th- and early 8th-cent.
               revisions by <ref rend="bold">Athanasios of Balad</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of
                  Edessa</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>, several of
               which survive; the later books of the ‘Organon’ were also translated by Athanasios,
               but these are no longer extant; Yaʿqub evidently knew the
               ‘Metaphysics’, but that work appears never to have been translated into Syriac; 3.
               further revisions and new translations made in the course of the ‘translation
               movement’ patronised by the Abbasid caliphs; the new translations also included many
               other works, beyond the ‘Organon’ (see Peters); hardly any of these survive in their
               original form, since they were usually made just to serve as the basis for further
               translation into Arabic; some use of them, however, was made by <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref> in his ‘Cream of Wisdom’ and elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>The earliest Syriac commentators, (for whom, see Hugonnard-Roche, <hi rend="italic">La logique</hi>, 123–291), <ref rend="bold">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Proba</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Pawlos the Persian</ref>, all belong to
               the early or mid-6th cent. (on internal evidence the 5th-cent. date sometimes given
               to Proba cannot be correct). In the 7th cent. <ref rend="bold">Severos Sebokht</ref>
               wrote on syllogisms, while Athanasios of Balad wrote an Introduction to Aristotelian
               logic, and Yaʿqub of Edessa provided an ‘Encheiridion’ of
               philosophical terms. Giwargi’s revision of the first three books of the Organon
               (including the whole of the ‘Prior Analytics’) is accompanied by introductions to a
               number of the books, as well as annotation. E.-Syr. authors from <ref rend="bold">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Babai</ref> onwards also show an
               awareness of Aristotle’s logical works, and writings dealing with topics in the
               ‘Organon’ by <ref rend="bold">Michael Badoqa</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿbokht</ref>,
                  <ref rend="bold">Silwanos of Qardu</ref> (who knows all the books of the ‘Organon’;
               CSCO 464, p. 35), <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>, and others survive, but no
               specific commentaries are preserved. A glimpse at the translation movement in action
               is given by <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref> in his Letters 43 and 48, on translating
               the ‘Topics’. From the late 12th cent. a commentary reaching the ‘Analytics’ by <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> survives (ms. Cambridge Gg. 2.14). In the
               early 13th cent. both <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref> (in his ‘Dialogues’) are concerned with related topics; a
               little later Bar ʿEbroyo, in his <hi rend="italic">Ktobo d-boboto</hi> covers in
               brief the whole of the ‘Organon’, while his ‘Cream of Wisdom’ serves as a general
               compendium of almost all aspects of Aristotelian philosophy.</p>
                    <p>Besides two short biographies (ed. Baumstark, <hi rend="italic">Aristoteles</hi>,
               2*–3*), a number of works falsely under Aristotle’s name were also translated into
               Syriac, the most notable being the <hi rend="italic">Peri Kosmou</hi> (‘On the
               universe’; ed. de Lagarde, <hi rend="italic">Analecta Syriaca</hi> , 134–58),
               translated by Sergios of Reshʿayna. Although it was once thought that the Arabic
               Neoplatonist work known as the ‘Theology of Aristotle’ was translated from a lost
               Syriac text, this is now considered improbable.</p>

                    <p>Armenia, the geographical area of Armenian Christianity and culture, borders the
               homeland of Syr. Christianity. For centuries, <ref rend="bold">Arameans</ref> and
               Armenians lived together in parts of northern Mesopotamia and northern Syria. The
               main cities of Syr. Christianity, <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>(Armenian <hi rend="italic">Uṙhay</hi>) and <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>(Armenian <hi rend="italic">Mcbin</hi>) had a mixed population, which included Syrians and
               Armenians. Within the Sasanian Empire, the lines of demarcation between the Ch. of E.
               and the Armenian Church were very porous. The E.-Syr. ecclesiastical province of <ref rend="bold">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>, which since the synod of <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq</ref>
               (410) had Nisibis as its metropolitan see, included the dioceses of Arzun, Qardu,
               Beth Zabdai, Beth Rahimai, and Beth Moksaye, which all had large Armenian populations
               and which occasionally show up as dioceses of the Armenian Church. In these and in
               other borderlands, there must have been a significant amount of bilingualism,
               reflecting a ‘veritable interpenetration’ between the two groups (Garsoïan 1992,
               63).</p>
                    <p>In the 1st cent. BC, the western part of Armenia was incorporated into the Roman
               Empire, while the larger part (‘Great Armenia’) remained within the Iranian sphere of
               influence, at times enjoying independence, at times ruled by Parthian and later
               Sasanian monarchs. Around 387 the Roman and Sasanian Empires agreed on a formal
               partition of Armenia (even though the frontier subsequently shifted). Despite the
               fact that in its formative period Armenian Christianity, not unlike Syr.
               Christianity, was divided over two empires, this did not lead — as in the case of the
               Syrians — to doctrinal division. This is often attributed to a stronger sense of
               ethnic and cultural identity among the Armenians than among the Syrians. In the
               Islamic period Armenians occasionally had their own kingdom, such as under the
               Bagratid dynasty, from the end of the 9th to the middle of the 11th cent. From the
               late 12th cent. to 1375, an independent Armenian kingdom existed in Cilicia (‘Little
               Armenia’), where many Armenians had settled. Cilician Armenia accepted union with
               Rome at the Council of Sis in 1307, but this union, which failed to receive support
               outside Cilicia, came to an end with the demise of the Cilician kingdom. In the
               Ottoman Empire, Armenians at first flourished. The patriarchate of Constantinople
               (Istanbul) was created to represent Armenian interests (and often other Christians’
               interests as well) at the capital. Armenians also lived in parts of Persia and
               Russia, and there were diaspora communities as far as Lemberg (Galicia, present-day
               Lwow in Poland). Significant emigration to Europe and North America started in the
               middle of the 19th  cent. The early 20th cent. saw the Armenian genocide, which
               largely coincided with the <ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref>, and which was followed by
               further dispersion. The short-lived independent Armenian Republic (1918– 1920) became
               part of the Soviet Union in 1920, to regain its independence only in September
               1991.</p>
                    <p>Christianity came to Armenia no later than the 3rd cent. and the Armenian Church was
               first organized by Gregory the Illuminator in the early 4th cent. An important factor
               in the development of Armenian Christianity was the invention of the Armenian script
               by Maštoc‘ (Mesrop), traditionally dated in or around 407, and preceded by Maštoc‘’s
               travels through Syria and Edessa. This was followed by a period of intense
               translation activity, from both Greek and Syriac. Prior to the invention of their own
               script, Armenians used Greek and Syriac as their literary and liturgical
               languages.</p>
                    <p>Among the translations of the earliest period (first half of the 5th cent.) are
               several Syriac texts, such as the Demonstrations of <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref>,
               transmitted in Armenian under the name of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> (ed.
               Lafontaine), several works by <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>(Armenian: Ephrem Asori ‘the
               Assyrian’ or ‘Syrian’), and a short treatise attributed to bp. <ref rend="bold">Aitalaha</ref> of Edessa, which is not preserved in Syriac. Ephrem’s Armenian
               works include the undoubtedly genuine ‘Hymns on Nicomedia’, which were written
               shortly after 358, and of which only a few Syriac fragments exist (ed. Renoux), and
               the Commentary on the <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref> (ed. Leloir). While for these
               two works (as well as for Aphrahaṭ) we are dealing with quite faithful translations
               of Syriac originals, the relationship to the Syriac original is more problematic for
               other works attributed to Ephrem, such as a collection of hymns (ed. Mariès and
               Mercier), which seem to contain Syriac materials, but may represent later rewritings,
               and an anti-Marcionite exposition of the Gospel (ed. Egan), which is probably not by
               Ephrem (see Bundy, against the view of the editor), even though a 4th-cent. Syriac
               original is very likely. In addition to the translations of originally Syriac works,
               some Greek patristic works were translated into Armenian not from Greek, but from an
               earlier Syriac translation. The two most well-known examples are <ref rend="bold">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History and <ref rend="bold">Basil of
                  Caesarea</ref>’s Homilies on the Hexaemeron. In the earliest layers of Armenian
               biblical and liturgical texts as well, the mark of Armenia’s early contacts with the
               Syriac world is clearly visible. Among indigenous Armenian authors who are well
               informed about Syriac Christianity and write about it or borrow themes or
               interpretations from it are Eznik of Kołb (author of a work known as either ‘Against
               the sects’ or ‘On God’), Koriwn (author of ‘The Life of Maštoc‘’), the author of the
               ‘Teaching of Gregory’ (incorporated into the ‘History of Agathangelos’), and the
               author of the ‘Epic histories’ (formerly known as Faustus of Byzantium).</p>
                    <p>In the aftermath of the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council’s condemnation of
               Antiochene theology, Armenian Christianity moved away from the Syriac sphere of
               influence and increasingly turned to the Greek imperial church. The Council of
               Chalcedon (451) at first did not have an impact on the Armenians, who at the same
               time were involved in the Battle of Avarayr (the outcome of which led to full
               Sasanian rule over Armenia). It is only in the course of the 6th cent. that church
               leaders and councils determined Armenia’s own theological position, partly in
               response to missionary activity carried out by representatives of the emerging Syr.
               Miaphysite Church and of the Dyophysite E.-Syr. Church. Even though the Armenians
               repeatedly took a position against dyophysitism, associated with <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref> as well as with the Ch. of E., a straightforward rejection of the
               Council of Chalcedon only took place at the Council of Dvin in 607. From the
               6th-cent. documents of the Armenian church (preserved in the ‘Book of Letters’) it
               appears that, in contrast with the Syr. Orth. and Coptic Miaphysite churches, the
               works of <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> did not obtain normative status in
               Armenia, but rather that a form of aphthartodocetism gradually became the official
               doctrine (regarding the body of Christ as inherently incorruptible). The question of
               whether this was associated with <ref rend="bold">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref> (whose
               works seem not to have been translated into Armenian), Severus’s opponent, or whether
               this had different roots and was nourished perhaps by the writings of <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>, some of which were translated into Armenian (see
               Ter-Minassiantz, 147–51, and more recently Cowe), has not yet been fully settled. Due
               to this different orientation within the Miaphysite tradition, there was always some
               distance between the Armenian Orth. and the Syr. Orth. Church, and occasionally some
               tension (Ter-Minassiantz). A list of historical complaints of the Syrians against
               the Armenians is found in treatises by <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon X bar Shushan</ref> and
                  <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>.</p>
                    <p>In spite of the theological complexities in their relationship, contacts and
               exchanges between Syr. and Armenian Christians continued throughout the centuries. In
               the early Islamic period, both the Ch. of E. and the Syr. Orth. Church had a presence
               in parts of the Armenian lands. Since the 8th cent., there was in Khilat (or Akhlat),
               on the western shore of Lake Van, an E.-Syr. metropolitan bp. as well as a Syr. Orth.
               bp. (Fiey 2003, 1427), while an E.-Syr. bp. also is attested for Bardaʿa (Armenian
               Partaw), on the Terter River (Van Lantschoot 1932). The E.-Syr. metropolitan see of
               Khilat was later given up as an independent see and added to Nisibis, whose
               metropolitan bp. in the 13th cent. had ‘Nisibis and Armenia’ in his title (Fiey, <hi rend="italic">Nisibe</hi>, 106). Translation activity from Syriac into Armenian
               went on. For example, some of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>’s exegetical work
               found its way into an Armenian commentary attributed to Ephrem (ed. Mathews), and the
               9th-cent. Commentary on the Gospel of John by <ref rend="bold">Nonos of Nisibis</ref>
               is preserved only in Armenian.</p>
                    <p>Intense contacts on all levels took place in the period of the Armenian Kingdom of
               Cilicia. Many Syrians must have settled in the relative safety of Cilicia, where the
               Syr. Orth. had bp. sees in Adana, Anazarba (ʿAyn Zarba), Sis (patriarchal residence
               between 1292 and the early 15th cent.), and Tarsus. There were Syr. Orth. monasteries
               in Cilicia as well, in particular those of Gawikat (or Kawikhat) and Paksimeṭ (or
               Baksimeṭ). <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, in his Chronicle, provides a wealth of
               information on Armenian history; in addition, one of the appendices to the Chronicle
               (no. 5) explicitly deals with the Armenians. Of Michael’s Chronicle two different
               translations were produced, one in 1246, by the Armenian author Vardan Arewelc‘i in
               collaboration with the Edessene monk Yeshuʿ (of Ḥeṣno d-Kifo, see Barsoum), the other
               in 1248 by Vardan alone (possibly after Yeshuʿ’s death). The translation was made
               from Michael’s autograph, which along with other mss. had been transferred from the
                  <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref> to Hṙomklay (Qalʿa Rumayta), where the
               Syr. Orth Patr. Ignatius Dawid resided for some time and where a Syr. Orth. church
               had been built. Both translations present a periphrastic and much shortened version
               of Michael’s Chronicle (Schmidt 1996). Other translations from Syriac made in
               Cilician Armenia include the ‘Syro-Roman Lawbook’ and the ‘Sententiae Syriacae’ (see
                  <ref rend="bold">Juridical literature</ref>); homilies by <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of
                  Serugh</ref> (Weitenberg, 349 and 350); the Psalm Commentary by <ref rend="bold">Daniel of Ṣalaḥ</ref>; and several works of medical content. A unique work on
               horse-medicine (written ca. 1300) was translated from Arabic, but the author
               explicitly identifies himself as a veterinary of Syrian descent and creed.
               Translations typically resulted from the collaboration of an Armenian and a Syriac
               native speaker (Weitenberg, with further references). While all the examples quoted
               here concern Syriac writings translated into Armenian, an interesting case of a
               Syrian author’s interest in Armenian may be seen in <ref rend="bold">Bar
               ʿEbroyo</ref>’s biblical commentaries, which in particular in the commentary on
               Psalms contain about 160 quotations of, or references to, the Armenian Bible
               (Göttsberger). The fall of the Cilician kingdom (1375) brought the close contacts
               between the Armenian and Syr. Orth. intellectual elite to an end, even though for the
               subsequent centuries further evidence exists of the ongoing interaction between
               Syriac and Armenian Christians (see, e.g., Kaufhold).</p>
                    <p>Among the cities in which Armenians and Syrians lived together for many centuries,
               Edessa assumes a special position. The Armenian presence there can be traced back to
               a very early period and some sources (including Yaʿqub of Edessa, in his Chronicle)
               present king Abgar and the original population of Edessa as Armenian. The story of
               Abgar’s conversion to Christianity became widely popular in Armenian, whereby an
               increasing Armenization took place, from its first attestation in Eusebius’s
               Ecclesiastical History and the 5th-cent. work attributed to Labubna, or Łerubna (the
               Edessene king’s scribe who is also mentioned in the Syr. <ref rend="bold">Teaching of
                  Addai</ref>) to the rewritten versions in Moses Xorenac‘i’s ‘History of the
               Armenians’ (probably 9th cent.) and the 10th-cent. historians Thomas Arcruni and
               Uxtanes. When the short-lived Crusade principality of Edessa fell to the Seljuks in
               1144, the Armenians were bewildered as much as the Syr. Christians were (see
               Dionysios bar Ṣalibi), as is shown by the lament written by Nerses Shnorhali (ET van
               Lint), the later Cath. of all Armenians (1166–99), who is known for his friendly
               relationship with Michael Rabo.</p>
                    <p>The contacts between Armenian and Syr. Christians are also reflected in art, as is
               illustrated in the 9th-cent. illuminated Gospel ms. of Queen Mlke (Venice, San
               Lazzaro 1144), which has been connected with the Syriac <ref rend="bold">Rabbula
                  Gospels</ref> (Stone et al.).</p>
                    <p>For the more recent period (16th–18th cent.) a number of Syriac-Armenian lexica are
               attested, reflecting language contact and bilingualism. Both within these lexica and
               outside of them, interesting examples of boundary crossing between the two langauges
               are found in Armenian texts written in Syriac script and in (at least) one Syriac
               text written in Armenian script (Van Lantschoot 1964, Brock, Schmidt 2007, Takahashi
               and Weitenberg [forthcoming]).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>A comprehensive study of Syr. Christian art and architecture is still missing, and
               only a few subfields are relatively well covered in overview monographs, such as the
               architecture of Syria west of the Euphrates (Butler; Lassus; Tchalenko), floor
               mosaics in churches of Syria and Lebanon (Donceel-Voûte), manuscript illumination
               (Leroy 1964), and wall paintings in Syria and Lebanon (Cruikshank Dodd; Immerzeel
               2009). Given Syr. Christianity’s intertwinement, throughout its history, with other
               linguistic, cultural, and religious traditions, the definition of what constitutes
               ‘Syr. Christian’ art or architecture is somewhat elusive and should not be attempted
               here. In the early period much of Syr. Christianity was situated in the Roman Empire,
               in which there was a great deal of overlap between Syr. Christian and Greek Christian
               art and culture. In the Islamic period certain forms of art were shared between Syr.
               Christians and Muslims. In addition, the proximity of Byzantine Christianity or even
               Western Christianity (esp. in the period of the <ref rend="bold">Crusades</ref>) had
               its impact on themes and forms of expressions. There is some evidence in the early
               Syr. tradition of the use of portable icons (the image of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, which was believed to be a portrait of Jesus, being the most famous of
               these), but it is only among the Christians of the Chalcedonian traditions (Melkite
               and Maronite) that the art of icon painting flourished and that local styles emerged,
               such as in the 13th cent. in Tripoli and in the 17th cent. in <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>. In the other Syr. traditions (Syr. Orth. and Ch. of E.) the cult of
               images in whatever form never became as prominent as it was in the Byzantine
               tradition, even though there is no evidence of any opposition to the use of
               figurative art, and suggestions that Syr. Christianity was somehow connected to the
               iconoclastic movement within the Byzantine tradition or to any other an-iconic
               tradition should be rejected (Brock 2004; Teule). In general, the study of Syr.
               Christian art and architecture is seriously hampered by the fact that the surviving
               remains are fragmentary and mostly deprived of their original context. Accompanying
                  <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref>, occasionally containing dates and names, may
               provide crucial information. In the present overview only a few areas will be
               highlighted.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">1. Pre-Christian Edessa</label>
                    <p>The art of the semi-independent kingdom of Edessa is accessible to us in a number of
               funerary mosaics, dated or datable to the first three cent. AD (prior to the mid–3rd
               cent.). Some of these show portraits of the deceased, often with their family; others
               have topics or figures from Greco-Roman antiquity, such as the Phoenix or Orpheus
               playing the lyre. Reflecting the life of the urban aristocracy, the mosaics show the
               proximity of the Parthian world, in particular in the costumes (Leroy 1957). Most of
               the mosaics (some of which are dated in their inscriptions) are contemporaneous with
               the nascent Christian communities in Edessa, and with our earliest Christian authors,
               such as <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>, but none of them can be identified as
               specifically Christian (Drijvers and Healey; Healey; Segal).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">2. Christian Architecture in Syria, Ṭur ʿAbdin, and
               Mesopotamia</label>
                    <p>The earliest dated church in the Syr. Christian area is the church of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref>which in a baptistery inscription that survives to the
               present day is dated to 359, i.e. the time when <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>lived in
               the city. Even though we are in the easternmost corner of the Roman Empire and in the
               heartland of Syr. Christianity, the inscription is not in Syriac, but in Greek.</p>
                    <p>Most of the evidence for churches between the 4th and 7th cent. is from the region
               between <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>and Aleppo. Known as the ‘Dead cities’, because
               they were abandoned in the early Islamic period due to shifting patterns of economy
               and trade (and are still largely deserted today), numerous sites show the secular and
               religious buildings of villages and medium-size communities. Several churches are
               impressive, and the architectural skeleton of some of them is well-preserved, having
               been exposed to the forces of nature only, not to re-use or destruction by humans.
               Some churches are very small (such as the single-aisled church of Qirqbize). Other
               churches derive their importance from their role as pilgrim destinations, such as the
               church of Qalbloze, and above all the magnificent church of <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun
                  the Stylite</ref>, which was built in the late 5th cent. and which consists of
               four three-aisled basilicas converging on the saint’s pillar. Even today the
               scattered ruins and the very refined capital sculptures evoke the church’s former
               majesty. Another popular pilgrim destination, which flourished in the 6th cent., is
               the shrine of Mar Sargis (St. Sergius) in Resafa, more eastwards in the Syrian steppe
               (ca. 160  km. southeast of Aleppo).</p>
                    <p>The region of <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> and the wider area around it also
               preserve some of the earliest churches of Syr. Christianity, some of which were
               expanded throughout the centuries and are still in use today. The well-preserved main
               church of <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> dates back to the 6th cent., while
               some of the rebuilding and refurbishment of the church of the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref> can be dated to the reign of the Byzantine emperor
               Anastasius (r. 491–518). Several other churches in this area go back to the early
               Islamic period, such as the church of Ḥaḥ and the church of the Holy Cross, in the
               monastery of the same name (<ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Ṣalīb</ref>).</p>
                    <p>A special architectural feature in some of the earliest churches is the bema. This is
               a raised platform, usually horseshoe-shaped and with low walls, which is located in
               the middle of the nave and on which the liturgy of the Word was performed. The
               above-mentioned churches of Qirqbize, Qalbloze, and Resafa provide interesting
               examples, while detached pieces of the bema construction have found their way to
               modern museums, such as the stone bema lectern of Bennawi, which is presently shown
               in the garden of the National Museum of <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref> (Brock and
               Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Hidden Pearl</hi>, vol. 2, 43). In recent years the bema
               has received considerable attention, both from liturgists and archeologists (Cassis,
               Loosley, Renhart, and Taft).</p>
                    <p>Several other detached pieces of church decoration, chancel panels, or door lintels,
               exhibiting ornamental motifs or iconographical themes, are found scattered all over
               the world. Two chancel panels in stone, uncovered at Rasm al-Qanafez (to the east of
               Salamiyya, Syria) and presently in the National Museum of Damascus, show Daniel among
               the lions and the three Magi approaching the Virgin with Child (<hi rend="italic">Syrie</hi>, 358–59; Peña, 84).</p>
                    <p>Floor mosaics as well often have left their original location. Most of the mosaics
               belonging to churches in Syria and Lebanon have conveniently been brought together by
               P. Donceel-Voûte, with the ‘Adam mosaic’ in the Michaelion of Huarte (ca. 15 km.
               north-northeast of <ref rend="bold">Apamea</ref>) as one of the highlights
               (Donceel-Voûte, 105), to be compared with the royal Adam shown on a mosaic panel in
               the Museum of Ḥama, the latter with a Greek and Syriac caption (ibid., 113; also in
               Brock and Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Hidden Pearl</hi>, vol.2, 41). More recently
               beautiful mosaics have been uncovered at Tall Biʿa, near Raqqaʿ/Kallinikos, in the
               church of a monastery that may have been the Monastery of Mar Zakkay, to which <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Tella</ref> once belonged (Kalla, with further
               references).</p>
                    <p>While by far the largest part of our evidence for the early period belongs to the
               W.-Syr. tradition (in particular Syr. Orth. and Melkite), there has been in recent
               years considerable and promising archeological activity in the geographical area of
               the Ch. of E. (Hauser; Kröger, with further references). The Christian monuments of
               Iraq (belonging to either the Ch. of E. or the Syr. Orth. tradition), a number of
               which go back to the first millennium, have been surveyed by Fiey in his three-volume
               publication <hi rend="italic">Assyrie chrétienne</hi>, while the same scholar devoted
               a separate volume to <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> (1959). Sites of particular
               significance are the city of <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref> (Harrak 2001), <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Behnam</ref>
               (nowadays Syr. Cath.), with its exceptional 13th-cent. carvings on the main entrance
               door. There is also some evidence of building activity associated with the Ch. of E.
               in the Holy Land, in particular a hermitage near Jericho (Fiey 1983, and Brock and
               Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Hidden Pearl</hi>, vol. 2, 46) and possibly a monastic
               complex at Tel Masos, in the northern Negev (Fritz and Maiberger).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">3. Manuscript Illumination</label>
                    <p>An excellent survey of illuminated mss. kept in Western and Middle-Eastern libraries,
               with detailed analysis, is available in Leroy 1964. The most significant set of early
               illuminations is found in the opening quire of the 6th-cent. ms. that contains the
                  <ref rend="bold">Rabbula Gospels</ref> (named after the scribe of the Gospel text),
               with its richly decorated canon tables and its full-page illuminations. Of the same
               period, or possibly slightly later, is the so-called ‘Syriac Bible from Paris’
               (Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 341), which contains mostly OT themes and figures (Sörries).
               The art of ms. illumination came to full fruition in the 11th to 13th cent.: along
               with biblical mss., such as the ‘Buchanan Bible’ (ms. Cambridge, Univ. Libr.
               Oo.I.1,2; on which, see Hunt), there are a number of lectionaries, most of them
               belonging to the Syr. Orth. tradition. The number of E.-Syr. illuminated mss. is very
               limited (for some 15th-cent. examples, see Leroy, 417–18 and 393–403; Brock and
               Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Hidden Pearl</hi>, vol.2, 237–38). In the 16th cent. the
               tradition of ms. illumination was given new life among the Chaldeans (see e.g. ms.
               Borgia Syr. 169, Leroy, 404–8). For more recent studies, esp. on the Syr. Orth. mss.
               of the 11th–13th cent., see e.g. Doumato. It should also be noted that ms.
               illumination is not limited to the mss. of the mainstream ecclesiastical traditions,
               but is also found, e.g., in magic mss. (Balicka-Witakowska 2008).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">4. Wall Paintings</label>
                    <p>Most of the late antique churches must have contained painting, either of a purely
               ornamental nature or intended to provide instruction or to impart devotion. Remains
               of painting can be found on some of the ruins, but no full Christian wall paintings
               from the first millennium have survived. The <ref rend="bold">wall paintings in Syria
                  and Lebanon</ref> deserve separate attention, with those of <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Qara</ref>, and the Lebanese Qadisha
               Valley as unmistakable highlights. Most of these belong to the period between the
               11th and 13th century. To the same period in all likelihood belongs a newly
               discovered wall painting in the church of Mar Gewargis in <ref rend="bold">Qaraqosh</ref>, near Mosul, representing the Baptism of Jesus (Snelders 2007).
               The art of wall painting continued well into the modern area. Interesting 18th-cent.
               examples are found in the Syr. Orth. church of Sergius and Bacchus in Ṣadad, ca. 100
               km. north east of Damascus (Brock and Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Hidden Pearl</hi>,
               vol. 2, 147–50).</p>
                    <p>In addition to the heartlands of Syr. Christianity, wall paintings reflecting Syriac
               Christianity may be found in <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in Egypt, which from
               the early 9th cent. onwards had a mixed Coptic and Syriac monastic population. While
               the earliest paintings in the main Church of the monastery predate the arrival of
               Syr. monks, some of the later paintings must reflect the interests and taste of the
               Syr. monks. This may be the case for the probably 10th-cent. painting of the Three
               Patriarchs (Innemée 1998), and even more so for the very fragmentarily preserved
               paintings of Emperor Constantine and King Abgar (holding the <hi rend="italic">mandylion</hi>), both of which are accompanied by Syriac inscriptions and may
               also belong to the 10th  cent. (Innemée and Van Rompay). Fully preserved paintings in
               three half-domes of the church, with Syriac inscriptions, belong to the early 13th
               cent. (Leroy 1982).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">5. Liturgical Vessels and Accessories</label>
                    <p>A large number of 5th- or 6th-cent. liturgical objects from Syria have been uncovered
               in the course of the 20th cent., in the area south-west of Aleppo (Mundell Mango). In
               some cases inscriptions provide information on the date and on the church to which
               the objects belonged: Kaper Koraon (the exact location of which is uncertain) and
               Beth Misona (three chalices and a paten, now in the Cleveland Museum of Art). While
               the link with Syriac Christianity seems to be obvious, the inscriptions are in Greek,
               not in Syriac. A  rare Syriac inscribed silver dish from the 6th cent., in the
               collection of the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, has been made popular among Syr.
               scholars by R. Murray’s <hi rend="italic">Symbols of Church and Kingdom</hi> (1975
               and 2004). It represents the Ascension, the women at the tomb, and the Crucifixion,
               along with soldiers, Peter and the cock, and Daniel in the lions’ den.</p>
                    <p>To a slightly later period, perhaps 8th or 9th cent., belongs a very well preserved
               bronze incense burner uncovered in Takrit (now in the National Museum of Baghdad); it
               has nine scenes from the life of Jesus (Harrak 2006), but no inscriptions.</p>
                    <p>From the early 13th-cent. a bronze liturgical fan is preserved (<hi rend="italic">marwḥā</hi> or <hi rend="italic">marwaḥtā</hi>, ‘flabellum’), now housed in the
               Belgian Museum of Mariemont. The Syr. inscription reports that it was made in 1202/3
               for Dayr al-Suryān in Egypt; it may have been produced in a workshop in the Mosul
               area (Snelders and Immerzeel). To the same period belongs the church treasure of
               Resafa, which includes a skillfully decorated silver chalice and a paten, both
               bearing inscriptions in Syriac (even though the objects may have been of Western
               origin or inspiration). The paten was a gift to the church of St. Sergius at Resafa
               by Ḥasnon of Edessa. These objects had probably been buried in order to be saved from
               the Mongol invasions of 1259/60 (Ulbert; Brock and Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Hidden
                  Pearl</hi>, vol. 2, 212).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">6. Liturgical Vestments</label>
                    <p>While some information on liturgical vestments may be extracted from literary sources
               and from depictions in ms. illuminations and wall paintings, a rare piece, presently
               housed in the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art, has recently been studied: a
               bishop’s stole (<hi rend="italic">batrashil), bearing inscriptions in Syriac and
                  Arabic. It was made for Bp.</hi>Athanasius Abraham Yaghmur of Nabk in 1534–35
               (Ball).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">7. Syr. Christian Art in the 21st Century</label>
                    <p>While the precious remains of ancient Syr. Christian art and architecture nowadays
               are receiving more attention from Syr. scholars and Syr. Christians alike, Syr.
               Christians at the same time are creating their own art forms, often inspired by the
               treasures of the past, to which they add new layers of interpretation and meaning
               according to their present-day situation. Churches are being renovated or new
               churches are being built in the Middle East, in India, and in the worldwide <ref rend="bold">Diaspora</ref>. In many of these churches the ancient art of wall
               painting is brought to new life, while present-day liturgical publications often
               reflect the illuminated manuscripts of the past (for the Maronite tradition, see e.g.
               Badwi).</p>

                    <p>Maronite polymath, Custodian of the Vatican Library, and titular bp. of Tyre. Born at
               Hasrun, he was educated from an early age at the Maronite College in Rome. From
               1715–7 he travelled in the Middle East, collecting mss., including many from <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in the Nitrian Desert. In 1739 he was appointed
               First Custodian of the Vatican Library, a post he held until his death. It was on the
               basis of the Syriac mss., in large part from Dayr al-Suryān, that he compiled his
               monumental <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Orientalis Clementino-Vaticana</hi>, in four
               volumes (1719–28; repr. 1975, with ‘Postface’ by J.-M. Sauget; and 2002). This was
               effectively the first European history of Syriac literature, and it remains an
               important resource even today, thanks to the many extensive excerpts of Syriac texts.
               The volumes are arranged as follows: I, Orthodox (i.e. Chalcedonian) authors; II,
               Syrian Orthodox writers; III.1, literature of the Church of the East, and III.2,
               history of the Church of the East. (III.1, 3–362 contains an annotated edition of the
               verse catalogue of Syriac authors by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>). The
               three-volume Catalogue of the Hebrew and Syriac mss. in the Vatican Library was also
               compiled by him in conjunction with Stephanus Evodius (1756–9; the Syriac mss. are
               described in vols. 2–3). He was also the editor of the three volumes of Greek texts
               attributed to <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> (1732, 1743, 1746; the three Syriac volumes
               were edited by <ref rend="bold">P. Mubārak</ref>/Benedictus). A list of his extensive
               published literary output was drawn up by A. Mai, in <hi rend="italic">Scriptorum
                  Veterum Nova Collectio III.2</hi> (1828), 165–68; this includes the many works
               left unpublished, or unfinished at his death (he had planned several further volumes
               of the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Orientalis</hi>); some of these were published
               posthumously (e.g. his monograph on the Patriarchs of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>,
               1881), while others perished in a fire several months after his death. Ms. Vat. Syr.
               389 is an autograph Syriac grammar (1707). He also played a central role in the Synod
               of Mount Lebanon (1736).</p>

                    <p>Scholar of the Christian East, professor at the University of Munich. Assfalg was
               born in Hohenaschau, Bavaria, on 6 Nov. 1919 and studied philosophy, theology, and
               Near-Eastern languages (Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac) in Freising and Eichstätt. He
               served in the German army during World War II and became a prisoner of war in France.
               In 1946, he continued his studies at the University of Munich, where he specialized
               in the field of Eastern Christian studies, in particular under the guidance of W.
               Hengstenberg (philology of the Christian East) and A. Spitaler (Semitic languages).
               He earned his doctoral degree in 1950 with a dissertation on ‘The Order of the
               Priesthood’, an Arabic liturgical manual of the Coptic Church, and his ‘Habilitation’
               in 1961 with an edition of the Old Georgian text of the Minor Prophets. Well-versed
               in all the languages of the Christian East, he taught at the University of Munich
               from 1963 and continued to do so, even after his official retirement in 1985. He died
               on 12 Jan. 2001 in Munich.</p>
                    <p>Among his Syriac publications, the catalogue of Syriac mss. in Germany (1963) should
               be singled out. Together with P. Krüger he co-edited the <hi rend="italic">Kleines
                  Wörterbuch des Christlichen Orients</hi> (1975), which was subsequently translated
               (with minor updates) into French (1991) and Polish (1998). His name is also closely
               associated with the journal <hi rend="italic">Oriens Christianus</hi>, of which he
               was co-editor from 1965 until his death. For his 70th birthday, a <hi rend="italic">Festschrift</hi> was presented to him (1979), which includes several
               contributions in the field of Syriac.</p>

                    <note type="abstract">In pre-modern sources, Assyrians (Atorāye) were inhabitants of the area or ecclesiastical province of Ator, around <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/139">Mosul</placeName>.<note/>
                    </note>

                    <p>In pre-modern sources, Assyrians (<hi rend="italic">Atorāye</hi>) were inhabitants of
               the area or ecclesiastical province of Ator, around <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>. In
               modern times, however, the name has taken on two expanded senses: to denote 1. the
               whole ethnic group historically represented by the Ch. of E.; and sometimes 2. the
               supposed ethnic group represented by all the Syriac churches.</p>
                    <p>1. In medieval sources there are isolated references that connect Syr. Christians
               with the ancient Assyrians, but this identification was not developed until the
               19th  cent. A. H. Layard identified the Christians he met as descendants of the
               ancient Assyrians whose buildings he was excavating (<hi rend="italic">Nineveh and
                  its Remains</hi>, vol. 2[1848], 237). Since the area around Mosul had been called
               ‘Assyria’ from ancient times, this identification was not unnatural. It was a further
               development, however, when Anglicans (probably first G. P. Badger), seeking to avoid
               the word ‘Nestorian’, began to use the name ‘Assyrian Christians’ for the whole
               Church of the East. This usage was made official by the Archbishop of Canterbury’s
               Mission to the Assyrian Christians (1886) — although the missionaries did not use the
               word once they were in the field. The general adoption of ‘Assyrian’ and the Assyrian
               ethnology by the people themselves came after 1900 under the influence of nationalist
               writers like Freydon Atoraya. It was further encouraged when the founding of the
               present state of Syria made it more urgent to find an ethnic name other than
               ‘Syrian’. A  popular etymology had it that <hi rend="italic">Surāyā</hi> (a variant
               of <hi rend="italic">Suryāyā</hi>, ‘Syrian’) was a corruption of <hi rend="italic">Asurāyā</hi> (even though correctly ‘Assyrian’ is <hi rend="italic">Atorāyā</hi>). Whatever its background, the name ‘Assyrian’ has proved convenient
               and is now generally used even by those who do not accept the connection with ancient
               Assyria. The Church of the East, although it has not especially promoted this
               connection, is officially styled ‘Church of the East of the Assyrians’ or ‘Assyrian
               Church of the East’. Among Chaldean Catholics, ‘Assyrian’ has had to compete with
               ‘Chaldean’ as the preferred ethnic name. Some have adopted ‘Assyro-Chaldean’ as a
               compromise.</p>
                    <p>2. The name ‘Assyrian’ was already in use in some W.-Syr. circles before World War I.
               It was popularized in the USA by writers like <ref rend="bold">Naʿʿūm Fāʾiq</ref>, and
                  <ref rend="bold">D. B. Perley</ref> who insisted that the different Syriac churches,
               eastern and western, were accidental divisions within a single nation. (From this
               period dates the adoption of ‘Assyrian’ into the names of some American Syr. Orth.
               parishes, who retain it today although without the accompanying nationalist agenda.)
               The Syr. Orth. hierarchy has generally opposed the name ‘Assyrian’, and writers
               within the Church emphasize its Aramean heritage over against any alleged Assyrian
               one.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Long-serving Patr. of the Syr. Orth. Church in the late 6th and early 7th cent. His
               consecration is commonly dated to 594 or 595, but there is confusion in the sources
               as to the exact date: medieval and modern authors have also suggested 587, 597, and
               603 as possibilities. All sources agree that Athanasios died in 631 and one gives 28
               July as the precise day (<hi rend="italic">Chronica Minora</hi>, vol. 2, ed. E. W.
               Brooks, p. 144).</p>
                    <p>Athanasios was ordained Patr. against his will. Afterwards, his bishops agreed to
               allow him to return to his monastery for a year to complete the task which had been
               assigned him there: tending camels. When the bishops came to collect Athanasios a
               year later, they found him working in a mud pit, helping to patch up a camel stable.
               This association with camels earned him the epithet <hi rend="italic">Gamolo</hi>
               ‘Camel Driver.’</p>
                    <p>Athanasios’s patriarchate spanned a tumultuous period in the history of the Near
               East: the Byzantine-Persian wars of the early 7th cent. Most of Athanasios’s actions
               recorded in historical sources relate to his confronting the implications for the
               church of changing political orders; in the course of his service he dealt either
               directly or indirectly with both Byzantine and Persian rulers.</p>
                    <p>Athanasios is credited with reorganizing the structure of the Syr. Orth. Church in
               the Persian Empire. He appointed bishops there and gave <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor
                  Matay</ref> primacy over all other monasteries in the Persian Empire.</p>
                    <p>In perhaps 629–30, Athanasios, along with twelve bishops, met with the Emperor
               Heraclius for twelve days in Mabbug and held theological discussions. When they
               ultimately refused to accept the Council of Chalcedon, Heraclius became enraged and
               unleashed a persecution on Miaphysites throughout the Empire.</p>
                    <p>In either 610 or 616, Athanasios and Anastasius, the Miaphysite Patr. of Alexandria,
               ended the Tritheist Schism which had divided the two churches since the late
               6th-cent. dispute between Damian and <ref rend="bold">Peter of Kallinikos</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The ‘Conflict of Severus’ (PO 4 and PO 49.4), which exists in Coptic fragments as
               well as in Arabic and Ethiopic, is the only stand-alone work of Athanasios which
               survives. His other extant works are all to be found embedded in the Chronicle of
                  <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>. They include: a letter of Athanasios to
               Quryaqos of <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref> (vol. 2, 381–94; vol. 4, 392–9); the synodicon
               established by Athanasios and Anastasios, Patr. of Alexandria, ending the Tritheist
               schism (vol.  2, 381–93; vol. 4, 392–9); an encyclical of Athanasios to the bps. of
               the East (vol.  2, 394–9; vol. 4, 400–2); a <hi rend="italic">libellus</hi> of
               Athanasios to Heraclius (vol. 2, 405–8; vol. 4, 404–8); and a letter to the Monks of
               Mor Matay (vol. 2, 414–7; vol.  4, 411–3).</p>
                    <p>After his death in 631, Athanasios was succeeded as Patr. by his synkellos, <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of the Sedre</ref>.</p>

                    <p>Translator, scholar, Patr. (684–87). Athanasios studied under <ref rend="bold">Severos
                  Sebokht</ref> in the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref> and later was a
               monk at the Monastery of Beth Malka. After being ordained he served in <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>. In 684, the Synod of <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref> made
               Athanasios Patr. <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>,
               the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>, the Chronicle of 846, and the Chronicle
               of 819 speak only briefly of his patriarchate. A single work by Athanasios from this
               time survives, a letter written against Christians who attend pagan feasts and eat
               the meat of pagan sacrifices. A later scribe added an incipit claiming that the
               letter refers to the sacrifices of Hagarenes. Athanasios died in September of 687 and
               was succeeded by Yulyanos Rumoyo.</p>
                    <p>Throughout his life Athanasios was an avid translator of Greek philosophical works
               and patristic authors. Several of his translations still survive. These include a
               translation of <ref rend="bold">Porphyry</ref>’s Isagoge that Athanasios completed in
               645 (ms. Vat. Syr. 158), the translation of an anonymous Greek introduction to logic
               (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,660, ed. Furlani), and selected letters of <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> that Athanasios translated in 669 at the
               request of Matthew the Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> and Daniel the Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,181; ed. Brooks 1902).
               Although none are fully extant, Athanasios also wrote commentaries; an excerpt from
               his scholia on <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref> is found in ms. London,
               Brit. Libr. Add. 14,725 and Michael Rabo refers to Athanasios as an interpreter of
               the scriptures.</p>

               ʿAbd al-Nūr and Narzkhan. Two of his brothers, Thoma and Yawseph, became priests.
               Athanasios became a monk at <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> ca. 1697 and was
               ordained priest before 1705. After he studied under Maph. <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun

               name Athanasios. In 1714, he was appointed bp. of Amid. Athanasios died in 1741; it
               is said that healing miracles took place on his tomb. He was a skilful scribe.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of Alexandria and Greek author. He became bp. of Alexandria in 328, but spent
               much of his life in exile due to his vigorous opposition to Arianism. Many of his
               numerous writings (in Greek) were translated into Syriac, and some of these survive
               in several recensions. Most of Athanasius’s works in Syriac are only known from early
               Syr. Orth. or Melkite mss. (in some cases there have been some dogmatic alterations).
                  <ref rend="bold">Timotheos  I</ref>, however, in his Letters knew of several works,
               and the Letter to Epictetus is quoted in both E.- and W.-Syr. dogmatic florilegia.
               The only work transmitted in a large number of mss. is the Life of Antony, which was
               later incorporated into <ref rend="bold">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>’s ‘Paradise of the Fathers’.
               The following are the most important translations which have so far been edited:</p>
                    <p>1. ‘On the Incarnation’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2091), ed. with ET, R. W.
               Thomson, <hi rend="italic">Athanasiana Syriaca</hi>, vol. 1 (CSCO 257–8; 1965). This
               represents the short recension of the Greek text.</p>
                    <p>2. ‘Life of Antony’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2101), ed. with FT, R.  Draguet (CSCO
               417–8; 1980); earlier editions by P.  Bedjan in <hi rend="italic">Acta Martyrum et
                  Sanctorum</hi>, vol. 5, and E. A. W. Budge in <hi rend="italic">Paradise of the
                  Fathers</hi> (1904). Draguet’s view that the very free translation represents a
               lost earlier form of the Greek text is now discounted.</p>
                    <p>3. ‘Exposition of the Psalms’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2140), ed. with ET,
               Thomson, <hi rend="italic">Athanasiana Syriaca</hi>, vol. 4 (CSCO 386–7; 1977). There
               is both a full and an abbreviated form.</p>
                    <p>4. ‘On Virginity’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2145), ed. with FT, J. Lebon in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>40 (1927), 205–48; ET in Brakke 1995, 303–9. This is only
               known in Syriac and Armenian.</p>
                    <p>5. Homily on Matt. 12:32 (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2096), ed. with ET, Thomson, <hi rend="italic">Athanasiana Syriaca</hi>, vol. 2.</p>
                    <p>6. Letters:</p>
                    <p>a. Festal Letters (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2102), ed. W. Cureton (1848); FT of the
               Syriac index in A.  Martin and M. Albert, in <hi rend="italic">SC</hi> 317 (1985). IT
               and study in A. Camplani, <hi rend="italic">Atanasio di Alessandria, Lettere Festali;
                  Anonimo, Indice delle Lettere Festale</hi>(2003). The Syriac translation is
               particularly important since most of the Greek originals is lost.</p>
                    <p>b. The following letters have been edited, with ET, by Thomson: in <hi rend="italic">Athanasiana Syriaca</hi>, vol. 1: to Epictetus (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2095);
               in <hi rend="italic">Athanasiana Syriaca</hi>, vol. 2: to Adelphius (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2098), (Serapion [<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2096]), the
               Africans (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2133), the Antiochenes (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2134), Maximus (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2100); in <hi rend="italic">Athanasiana Syriaca</hi>, vol. 3: to Jovian (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2253).
               The Letter to Epictetus was also published by P. Bedjan, <hi rend="italic">Nestorius,
                  Le livre d’Héraclide</hi> (1910), 577–96.</p>

               Syriac translations include Against the Arians (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2093), in
               ms. Damascus Patr. 12/24 (beginning and end lost; see S. P. Brock, in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>86 [1973], 437–42).</p>
                    <p>A number of writings claiming to be by Athanasius were put out under his name by
               Apollinarians; some of these were translated into Syriac and have been published: On
               the Incarnation of God the Word (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 3365), ed. with ET,
               Thomson, <hi rend="italic">Athanasiana Syriaca</hi>, vol. 3; That Christ is one (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 3737), ed. with ET, Thomson, <hi rend="italic">Athanasiana

               Lietzmann, 1904).</p>
                    <p>Other texts wrongly ascribed in Syriac to Athanasius are:</p>
                    <p>1. ‘On the Cross and the Passion’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2247), ed. with ET,
               Thomson, <hi rend="italic">Athanasiana Syriaca</hi>, vol. 3.</p>
                    <p>2. ‘Against Apollinarius I’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2231), ed. with ET, Thomson,
                  <hi rend="italic">Athanasiana Syriaca</hi>, vol. 3. Three recensions are

               completing his elementary studies in Alqosh, his uncle the patr. took him to Rome
               where Audo joined the college of Congregatio de Propaganda Fide from 1869 to 1880. He
               was ordained a priest in 1880 and returned to <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> where he
               served under his uncle’s successor Patr. Eliya ʿAbū al-Yūnan. He later served as
               patriarchal vicar to <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> in 1882 for four years, after which
               he returned to Mosul to take charge of the <ref rend="bold">Seminary of St. John</ref>.
               He was consecrated bp. of <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref> and Salamas in 1892, and
               participated in the Synod that elected Patr. ʿAbdishoʿ Khayyāṭ in 1894. During the
               persecutions that occurred during World War I, he protected and provided shelter to
               many refugees, only to become a victim himself when he was assassinated, along with
               other priests and parishioners, on 27 July 1918.</p>
                    <p>Audo produced a Syriac-Syriac lexicon entitled <hi rend="italic">Simta d-leššāna
                  suryāyā</hi> / <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire de la langue chaldéenne
               </hi>(2  vols.; Mosul, 1897–1901); a grammar of Swadaya (i.e. colloquial) Neo-Aramaic
               entitled <hi rend="italic">Gramaṭiqi d-leššānā swādāyā</hi>  / <hi rend="italic">Grammaire de la langue chaldéenne moderne. Dialecte d-Ourmiah</hi> (Urmia, 1905;
               2nd  ed. 1911); and a liturgy for the feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, published
               by <ref rend="bold">Bedjan</ref> in <hi rend="italic">Breviarium Chaldaicum</hi>,
               vol. 3 (Paris, 1886–7). He translated the following works from Latin into Syriac: P.
               Scavini’s <hi rend="italic">Theologia moralis ad mentem S. Alphonsi M. de Ligorio (2
                  vols.; Urmia, 1899, 1900)</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Catechismus Romanus ex decreto

               (French title <hi rend="italic">Instruction pour les ministres de L’Église</hi>;
               Mosul, 1895). He also translated from Arabic into Syriac the fables of <ref rend="bold">Kalila and Dimna</ref> (French title <hi rend="italic">Kalila et Dimna fables
                  indiennes</hi>; Mosul, 1895). He also revised a translation into Syriac, made by
               the Chald. monk <ref rend="bold">Damyanos of Alqosh</ref> (d. 1858), of an Arabic
               version of Paolo Segneri’s <hi rend="italic">Manuale Sacerdotum</hi> (Mosul, 1882;

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Mar Awgen is the traditional founder of monasticism in Mesopotamia. The two primary
               sources for his life are an anonymous ‘Life of Mar Awgen’ and a brief account
               preserved in the ‘Book of Chastity’, composed by <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>of
               Baṣra (9th cent.). He receives an earlier mention in <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ
                  Qaṭraya</ref>, in the 7th cent. Mar Awgen was an Egyptian, born in the time of
               Constantine. He worked for twenty-five years as a pearl diver, but then left this
               occupation to join the nascent monastic movement, and he became a disciple of
               Pachomius, the famous Egyptian monastic leader. After spending some time in the
               monastery of Pachomius, Mar Awgen travelled to <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> and
               founded a monastery on nearby Mt. Izla. His seventy disciples who followed him from
               Egypt were the reputed founders of other monasteries in various parts of Mesopotamia
               and other Syriac-speaking lands. Mar Awgen himself is said to have performed numerous
               miracles in the presence of Shapur, the King of Persia. It has also been reported
               that his remains and those of certain of his disciples were brought to the Monastery
               of Mar Ḥananya (<ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>). Mar Awgen is held in the
               highest esteem in all the eastern churches with Syriac roots.</p>
                    <p>Scholars have now shown that this traditional account does not have a firm historical
               foundation and has served primarily to obfuscate the native origins of
               Syro-Mesopotamian monasticism in favor of reputed Egyptian origins. These accounts
               of Mar Awgen have been shown to be of late origin, anachronistic, and extremely
               divergent on important details, e.g. the number of his disciples ranges from eighteen
               to seventy, and a number of monks named in these accounts actually lived as late as
               the 7th and even 10th cent. Attempts to connect Mar Awgen to the Aōnes mentioned in
               Sozomen’s Ecclesiastical History (VI.33) have failed, and it is even possible, as
               some scholars have surmised, that there was, in fact, no such historical person as
               Mar Awgen.</p>

               interregnum (609–28) following the death of the Cath. <ref rend="bold">Grigor</ref>,
               the Ch. of E. was administered jointly by the Archdeacon and Babai, the latter having
               the title ‘Visitor of the monasteries’. He died shortly after the death of Khusrau II
               (628), who had not allowed the appointment of a successor to Grigor.</p>
                    <p>Babai’s writings cover four main topics:</p>
                    <p>1. Christology. His ‘Book of the Union, on the divinity and humanity (of Christ) and
               on the prosopon of the union’, remains a fundamental statement of the Christology of
               the Church to this day. It is composed in seven books, of which the seventh may
               originally have belonged to another work. The ‘Book of the Union’ was edited (with
               LT) by A. Vaschalde (CSCO 79–80; 1915); there is an unpublished ET by M. Birnie. In
               the same volume of the CSCO there is also a short treatise ‘Against those who say
               “Just as the body and soul are one <hi rend="italic">qnomā</hi>, so too God the Word
               and the Man are one <hi rend="italic">qnomā</hi>” ’. An excerpt arguing that ‘two
               natures’ (in the incarnate Christ) implies ‘two <hi rend="italic">qnome</hi>’
               features in a late collection of Christological texts (ed. with ET by L. Abramowski
               and A. Goodman, <hi rend="italic">Nestorian Christological Texts</hi> [1972], vol. 1,
               207–9 [Syr.], vol. 2, 123–5 [ET]).</p>
                    <p>2. Monastic topics. Of great significance, for its learning as well as for its
               length, is his Commentary on <ref rend="bold">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>’s ‘Gnostic
               Chapters’ (ed. with GT by Frankenberg, 1912). Babai also wrote a Commentary on <ref rend="bold">Mark the Monk</ref>’s ‘Spiritual Law’ (unpublished; study by G. Krüger,
               in <hi rend="italic">OC</hi> 44 [1960], 46–74). A collection of short ‘Useful
               Counsels on the Ascetic Life’ are also unpublished, but there is an ET by G.
               Chediath, <hi rend="italic">Babai the Great. Some Useful Counsels on the Ascetic
                  Life</hi> (Moran Etho 15; 2001). Babai wrote a set of Rules for monks, preserved
               only in Arabic translation (ed. with ET, <ref rend="bold">A. Vööbus</ref>, <hi rend="italic">Syriac and Arabic Documents regarding Legislation relative to Syrian
                  Asceticism</hi> [1960], 176–84).</p>
                    <p>3. Hagiography. In his Life of Gewargis (ed. <ref rend="bold">P. Bedjan</ref>, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de Mar Jabalaha, de trois autres patriarches, d’un prêtre
                  et deux laiques, nestoriens</hi> [1895; repr. 2007], 424–8) Babai gives a list of
               his hagiographical works, but of these only the Life of Mihramgushnasp/Gewargis
               (martyred in 615) survives in full (ed. Bedjan, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de Mar
                  Jabalaha,</hi>416–571; GT by G. Hoffmann, 1880). Unfortunately the only ms. of a
               woman martyr, Christina, breaks off soon after the beginning (ed. Bedjan, <hi rend="italic">Acta Martyrum et Sanctorum</hi>, vol. 4, 201–7).</p>
                    <p>4. Liturgy. Two <hi rend="italic">tešbḥātā</hi> (‘Our Father who is in heaven, holy
               is his nature...’ and ‘Blessed is the Compassionate One who in his grace...’) are
               specifically attributed to him (though some mss. have a different attribution); the
               first of these also features in the Maronite <hi rend="italic">Šḥimto</hi> (Thurs.
                  <hi rend="italic">Lilyo</hi>). A Hymn for the Commemoration of the Greek Doctors
               is also attributed to him (ms. Cambridge Add. 1980, f. 210r; not found in T. Darmo’s
               edition of the <hi rend="italic">ḥudrā</hi>).</p>
                    <p>5. Parts of a work on the monastic life are preserved in a ms. (M20N) of the ‘New
               Finds’ at the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref>, Mount Sinai.</p>
                    <p>A large number of other works by Babai have not survived (<ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> states that he wrote ‘83 volumes’ in all).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>City on the Tigris, approximately 35 km. north of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>. The seat of the Ch. of E. Cath. under the Abbasids and
               the seat today of the Chald. Patr. and Ancient Ch. of E. Patr. ‘Baghdad’, whose
               etymology is disputed, was originally the name of one of the villages that stood on
               the site of the city founded by the second Abbasid caliph al-Manṣūr under the name of
               Madīnat al-Salām ‘City of Peace’ in 762. Later Syriac authors often call the city
               ‘Babel’, i.e. Babylon. From 762 until 1258, when it was taken by Hulagu (except in
               836–92, when the caliphs resided in Sāmarrāʾ), Baghdad was the seat of the Abbasid
               caliphate, and in the first half of that period was among the most prosperous and
               culturally advanced cities in the world. Capital of a province corresponding largely
               to the central part of today’s Iraq under the Ottomans (1534–1623, 1638–1918),
               Baghdad became the capital of the newly formed state of Iraq in 1921.</p>
                    <p>The first Ch. of E. Cath. to spend time in Baghdad was Yaʿqob II (753–73), namely in
               a prison there, an experience shared by the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref rend="bold">Giwargis</ref> I (759–90) and the Melk. Patr. Theodoros (751–97). Cath. <ref rend="bold">Ḥenanishoʿ II</ref> (773–80), though elected in the Monastery of Mar
               Petion in Baghdad, continued to reside in Seleucia-Ctesiphon. With <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref> (780–823) the Catholicoi begin to reside permanently in
               Baghdad. Major groups of Christians who settled in the city came from earlier E. Syr.
               centers at <ref rend="bold">Ḥirta</ref>, Kashkar (al-Wāsiṭ), and <ref rend="bold">Beth
                  Garmai</ref>. W.-Syr. Christians also had a significant presence in Baghdad by the
               end of the 8th cent. Beginning with Timotheos I himself, in the period down to the
               middle of the 11th cent., Syr. Christian scholars played a vital role in the
               intellectual life of Baghdad, especially as physicians and as translators of Greek
               philosophical and scientific works into Arabic — scholars such as <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873), Abū Bishr Mattā b. Yūnus (d. 940), <ref rend="bold">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (893–974), and <ref rend="bold">Abū al-Faraj ibn
                  al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043), to name but a few (see <ref rend="bold">medicine</ref>
               and <ref rend="bold">Greek, Syriac translations from</ref>). Though not subject to
               official persecutions as occurred earlier under the Sasanians, the Christians in
               Baghdad were subject to certain discriminations and were vulnerable to attacks by the
               populace, especially at times of instability under weak governments, which was often
               the case from the middle of the 10th cent. onwards.</p>
                    <p>The residences of the Catholicoi generally followed the movement of the political and
               commercial center of the city. In the first period, they resided on the right bank of
               the Tigris, in the Monastery of Klil Ishoʿ (also called Dayr al-Jāthalīq ‘Monastery
               of the Catholicos’) to the south of the ‘Round City’, where most of the Catholicoi
               from Timotheos I to Sargis I (860–72) were buried, and in the Monastery of Mar Petion
               (Dayr al-ʿAtīqa) in the former village of Sūrāyā (al-ʿAtīqa) to the east of the Round
               City, which predated the foundation of Madīnat al-Salām and was restored by Sabrishoʿ
               II (831–35). Yoḥannan II (884–91) was the first Catholicos to establish his residence
               on the left bank, in the Shammāsiyya Quarter in the northern part of the walled city
               of that period. Most of the Catholicoi from Yoḥannan III (893– 899) to Eliya II
               (1111–32) resided there and were buried in the ‘Palace of the Greeks’ (Dār al-Rūm).
               Barṣawma  I (1134–36) moved his residence south to the Church of Mar Sabrishoʿ in Sūq
               al-Thalātha, and Yahbalaha II (1190–1222) to the Church of St. Mary in the Karkh
               Quarter on the west bank. After the fall of Baghdad to the initially pro-Christian
               Mongols, Makkika  II (1257–65) was given a group of buildings centered around the
               mansion of a former vizier on the Tigris as his residence, but his successor Denḥa I
               (1265–81) was forced to withdraw to <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref> by Muslim reactions
               against Mongol rule in the city. <ref rend="bold">Yahbalaha III</ref> (1281–1317), <ref rend="bold">Timotheos II</ref> (1318–32) and, probably, Denḥa II (mid-14th cent.)
               were still consecrated in Baghdad, but normally resided away from Baghdad in northern
               Iraq and (today’s Iranian) Azerbaijan.</p>
                    <p>Ḥabib, the first known Syr. Orth. bp. of Baghdad, is attested in 818. Among the
               churches belonging to the Syr. Orth. community in Baghdad was that of Mār Tūmā, the
               burial place of Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī, in the Christian quarter (Qaṭīʿat al-Naṣārā) to the
               south of the Round City. Ch. of E. Cath. Yoḥannan V (1000–11) succeeded in obtaining
               a decree from the caliph forbidding the long-term residence of Syr. Orth. maphrians
               in Baghdad during a visit to the city by Maph. Ignatius bar Qiqi (991–1016) in
               1003/4. Nevertheless, <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon bar Maʿdani</ref> (Maphr. 1232–53, Patr.
               1253–63) was later able to spend several years of his maphrianate in Baghdad,
               devoting part of that time to the study of Arabic literature. The last pre-modern
               Syr. Orth. bp. of Baghdad was Timotheos Yeshuʿ, ordained there by <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref> in 1265.</p>
                    <p>Little is heard of the Christians in Baghdad after the sack of the city by Timur in
               1401, and it is only in the 17th cent. that we have evidence again of the presence of
               Christians in any significant numbers. From the middle of the 19th cent., the Chald.
               patriarchs (bearing the title ‘of Babylon’), though normally resident in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, often visited Baghdad. Two of them, Yoḥannan  VIII Hormizd
               (1830–38) and ʿAbdishoʿ V Khayyāṭ (1895–99), died and were buried in Baghdad. The
               Chald. patriarchate was transferred from Mosul to Baghdad de facto under Yawsep VII
               Ghanīma (1947–58) and officially under Pawlos   II Cheikho (1958–89). The Ch. of E.
               Patr. Shemʿon XX Pawlos (1918–20), who died as a refugee in Baʿqūba, was interred in
               Baghdad. The Ch. of E. has had a bishop in Baghdad since 1951. Baghdad has been the
               seat of the patriarchs of the Ancient Church of the East since 1968, when <ref rend="bold">Toma Darmo</ref> (d.  1969) was elected patriarch there by those opposed
               to the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in the Ch. of E. The Syr. Catholic
               Church has had a bp. resident in Baghdad since 1862. The new Syr. Orth. see of
               Baghdad and Baṣra was erected in 1960, and has had the scholar Būlus Behnām (metr.
               1962–69) and the future patriarch Severus (later Ignatius) Zakkā ʿIwāṣ (metr.
               1969–80, Patr. 1980–) as its occupants.</p>
                    <p>There are around fifty churches of various denominations in the city today (including
               24 Chald., 7 Syr. Orth., 4 Ch. of E., 3 Syr. Catholic, and 2 Ancient Ch. of E. in
               regular use, according to S. Rassam, <hi rend="italic">Christianity in Iraq</hi>,
               2005). The oldest is that of Virgin Mary on al-Maydān Square near the northern end of
               the Ottoman city area, built in 1639 and now in Armenian Orthodox hands. A number of
               churches were founded in the 19th  cent. in the area that came to be called ʿAqd
               al-Naṣārā nearer the center of the old city, including the Chald. Church of Mary
               Mother of Sorrows (Umm al-Aḥzān; place of burial of Patr. Yoḥannan VIII, ʿAbdishoʿ V,
               and Pawlos II) and the former Syr. Cath. cathedral, as well as the Latin church now
               used by the Coptic Orthodox. Many of the newer representative churches are found in
               the area to the southeast of the city center, including the new Syr. Cath. Cathedral
               of Our Lady of Deliverance/Sayyidat al-Najāt (1968, commonly called Umm al-Ṭāq) and
               the Chald. Church of St. Joseph (Kharbanda, 1956; place of burial of Patr. Yawsep
               VII) in the eastern part of al-Karrāda. The Syr. Orth. cathedral (Sts. Peter and
               Paul, 1964) is located further east near the University of Technology, and the
               Ancient Church of the East cathedral (Virgin Mary, 1988) further southeast in Ḥayy
               al-Riyāḍ. Another important Christian area of the city is al-Dawra to the south of
               the large bend of the Tigris, including the ‘Assyrian Quarter’ (Ḥayy al-Āthūriyyīn)
               in its southern part and Ḥayy al-Mīkānīk further south with the Ch.  of E. Church of
               Mar Zaya (built to replace the former Cathedral of Mar Zaya in Karrādat Maryam which
               was demolished by the government in 1985) and the Pontifical Babel College for
               Philosophy and Theology (founded in 1991, temporarily transferred to ʿAynkawa near
               Arbela in 2007). Many of the churches in Baghdad have been the targets of terrorist
               attacks in the period of instability since 2003.</p>
                    <p>The Syriac Corporation of the Iraqi Academy of Science, originally founded as the
               Syriac Academy in 1975, has played an important role in the promotion of the academic
               study of Syriac. A Department of Syriac Language was established at the University of
               Baghdad in 2004. The troubles since 2003 have had adverse effects on the state of
               Syriac and Christian Arabic mss. in Baghdad, including those in major collections,
               such as those of the Chald. Monastery of St. Antony (collection formerly at the
               Monastery of Our Lady of the Seeds at <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref>), the Chald.
               Patriarchate (incorporating collections from elsewhere in Iraq) and the Ch. of E.
               Archbishopric, as well as those in other ecclesiastical, public and private
               collections.</p>

                    <p>Bahdeidat is 12 km. northeast of Jbeil (Giblet or Byblos), 47 km. from <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref>, 550 m. above sea level. The small church of Mar Tadros, which is
               nowadays Maronite, is built as a single barrel-vaulted nave with a wide, protruding
               porch open at the west end. It measures ca. 13x8 m. without the porch.</p>
                    <p>The east end is covered with a coherent program of wall paintings spilling over to
               the northern and southern walls of the nave. In the semi-dome is the Enthroned Christ
               in Majesty, with the Cherubim and Seraphim on either side, waving standards that give
               the words of the Trisagion. Behind the throne are the four beasts of the Apocalypse,
               the man (Matthew), the lion (Mark), the bull (Luke) and the eagle (John). Behind
               these are the standing figures of Mary and John the Baptist, their hands held out in
               supplication. The twelve apostles stand below this Vision, with the prophet Daniel at
               the northern end of the row and St. Stephen on the south.</p>
                    <p>The triumphal arch shows the Christ Emmanuel, between the Sacrifice of Isaac on the
               north and Moses Receiving the Tablets of the Law on the south. Below them are Mary
               and Gabriel of the Annunciation.</p>
                    <p>On the nave walls, on either side of the apse, is the equestrian knight St. Theodore
               spearing a dragon and the riding St. George, bearing the small water-carrier behind
               him. Both the equestrian knights are shown with donor portraits beneath the
               horses.</p>
                    <p>All the wall paintings are inscribed in a mixture of Serṭo and Esṭrangela.</p>
                    <p>These wall paintings represent the only comprehensive series of paintings executed by
               one workshop to have survived in Lebanon. In style they closely resemble the
               paintings of a church in the nearby village of <ref rend="bold">Maʿad</ref>. According
               to a ms. in Dayr al-Shife, not far from Bahdeidat, a Syr. Orth. priest called Naʿman
               was ordained in Bahdeidat in 1256. This 13th-cent. date accords with the style of the
               paintings in both Bahdeidat and Maʿad and they belong to the Syr. Orth. tradition of
               painting, like the paintings of <ref rend="bold">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>. At
               some point after the 13th cent. the church would have passed from the Syr. Orth. to
               the Maronites.</p>

                    <p>Balad, Assyrian Balaṭ, Syriac and Arabic Balad or Balaṭ, and modern Aski Mosul
               (Turkish for ‘Old Mosul’) are names referring to a town located some 40 km. northwest
               of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, on the west bank of the Tigris. Balad occurs in the
               inscriptions of the Assyrian king Sennacherib (BC 705–681), and in Syriac sources as
               part of the province of <ref rend="bold">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>. In the late 5th cent. it
               became an E.-Syr. bishopric seat, beginning with bps Ḥawaḥ and Shubḥa l-Ishoʿ, who
               were present at the synod of Mar Babai that took place in <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> in 497. The long line of E.-Syr. bps. ended around 1364
               with Aaron. Balad was also a Syr. Orth. bishopric seat, but only one bp., Mushe (mid
               9th cent.), bore the title ‘bp. of Balad’. The other bishops may have resided in Dayr
               al-Muʿallaq ‘Hanging Monastery’, located some 15 km. from the city, on Mt. Buṭmān.
               They bore the title ‘bp. of Beth ʿArbaye’, having under their jurisdiction Sinjār and
                  <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, in addition to Balad. The last bp. was called ‘of
               Sinjār’ and served in this rank between 1317 and 1345, a fact that led Patr. <ref rend="bold">Afram Barsoum</ref> to date the final destruction of Balad to the 14th
               cent. Two famous Syr. Orth. bps. originated from Balad, <ref rend="bold">Aḥudemmeh</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Athanasios II</ref>.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Physician, scribe, and author of a Syriac-Arabic Lexicon. In spite of some confusion
               in the scholarly literature (see Butts), Ishoʿ bar ʿAli can in all likelihood be
               identified with ʿĪsā b. ʿAlī, student of the well-known translator <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873). From Arabic sources, it is known that he was the
               personal physician of Caliph al-Muʿtamid (r. 870–892), and that he authored two works
               (in Arabic) in the field of medicine, the ‘Book of the benefits made use of from the
               organs of animals’ and the ‘Book of poisons’. In addition, he is mentioned as a
               scribe in the colophon of two mss. of the Arabic Diatessaron (Vatican, Borg. Arab.
               250; Oxford, Bodleian Arab. e 163).</p>
                    <p>Bar ʿAli is, however, best known for his Syriac-Arabic Lexicon (ed. Hoffmann [<hi rend="italic">ʾālap</hi>through <hi rend="italic">mim</hi>]; Gottheil [<hi rend="italic">nun</hi> through <hi rend="italic">taw</hi>]). In the preface to his
               Lexicon, Bar ʿAli states that he undertook its writing at the behest of a certain
               deacon Abraham. During his readings, Abraham had been employing the Lexicon of Ḥunayn
               b. Isḥāq as well as a Lexicon compiled by <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ of Merv</ref>. Abraham
               seems to have been happy with the former, but less so with the latter. In addition,
               according to Abraham, the lexicon of Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq and that of Ishoʿ of Merv
               differed at times in their definitions. Thus, Bar ʿAli undertook composing a new
               lexicon on the basis of these two previous works and supplemented by his own
               readings. At the end of the Preface, Bar ʿAli exhorts his future readers to expand
               and supplement his Lexicon with additional words. The name of one such expander is
               known from a postscript found in some mss., and it is none other than the
               aforementioned deacon Abraham.</p>
                    <p>The Lexicon of Bar ʿAli is an important source for Syriac lexicography. Already in
               the 1830s, the Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer F. H. W. Gesenius pointed out the
               significance of Bar ʿAli’s Lexicon for Semitic studies. In addition, the Lexicon of
               Bar ʿAli — along with that of <ref rend="bold">Ḥasan Bar Bahlul</ref> (mid-10th cent.)
               — was incorporated into R. Payne Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Syriacus
               </hi>and, to a lesser extent, C. Brockelmann’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon
                  Syriacum</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Finally, it should be noted that Bar ʿAli is to be distinguished from two other
               individuals with similar names: 1. ʿĪsā b. ʿAlī, who was the son of the ‘good vizier’
               ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā b. Dāʾūd b. al-Jarrāḥ (d. 946), who was a student of <ref rend="bold">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (d. 974), and who died in 1001 (see J. L. Kraemer, <hi rend="italic">Humanism in the Renaissance of Islam. The cultural revival during
                  the Buyid age</hi> [1986], 134–36); 2. ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā al-kaḥḥāl, who authored the
               ‘Prescription of Oculists’(<hi rend="italic">tadhkirat al-kaḥḥālīn</hi>), who was a
               student of <ref rend="bold">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043), and who died sometime after
               1010 (see E. Mittwoch, in <hi rend="italic">EI<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>

                    <p>Scholar and lexicographer. Born in Awāna, ca. 60 km. north of <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>, in the region of Ṭirhan, Bar Bahlul spent most of his life in
               Baghdad and belonged to the Christian intellectual elite, who interacted with Muslim
               scholars and were thoroughly bilingual. Bar Bahlul used both Syriac and Arabic in his
               publications. He was involved in the election of Cath. ʿAbdishoʿ I in 963.</p>
                    <p>Bar Bahlul’s Lexicon (Syr. <hi rend="italic">Leksiqon</hi>) deals with scholarly and
               technical terminology and includes both Syriac words and Greek words in Syriac
               transliteration. The explanations are primarily in Syriac, but mostly contain
               equivalents and/or short comments in Arabic. Common Syriac words are normally not
               included. The words are taken from the Bible as well as from theological,
               philosophical, and scientific writings; a number of proper names are included as
               well. The words are in alphabetical order, even though Bar Bahlul occasionally groups
               together Syriac words that are based on the same root. The Lexicon brings the Syriac
               tradition of lexicography to full fruition. In composing it, Bar Bahlul heavily
               relied on two works by <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873) — a work on
               homographs and a no longer extant lexicon proper (<hi rend="italic">puššāq
               šmāhe</hi>) — as well as on a no longer extant lexicon by <ref rend="bold">Ḥenanishoʿ
                  bar Seroshway</ref> (ca. 900).</p>
                    <p>By way of these main sources and through personal reading Bar Bahlul included in his
               work words culled from many different authors and texts of Greek, Syriac, and Arabic
               origin. Some Syr. Orth. authors are occasionally quoted as well, such as <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Mushe bar Kipho</ref>, along with a few non-Christian works, such as the
               Proverbs of the <ref rend="bold">Arameans</ref> (<hi rend="italic">matle
               d-Ārāmāye</hi>) — a title that reminds one of the <ref rend="bold">Aḥiqar</ref>
               proverbs — and <ref rend="bold">Kalila and Dimna</ref>. Bar Bahlul also provides rare
               information on dialectal variation within the Syriac language of his day, referring,
               among others, to the languages of <ref rend="bold">Beth Aramaye</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Beth Qaṭraye</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Beth Garmai</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>
               (Atur), Gazarta, <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref>.
               Several words, expressions, names, and titles of works are known to us only through
               Bar Bahlul’s Lexicon, which has rightly been called a ‘linguistic and cultural
               encyclopedia’ (Ḥabbi). Preserved in both E.- and W.-Syr. mss., much of the
               information of the ‘Lexicon’ was incorporated in the modern dictionaries of R. Payne
               Smith and, to a lesser extent, of C. Brockelmann.</p>
                    <p>Another work by Bar Bahlul became known only a few decades ago. His ‘Book of signs’
                  (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-dalāʾil</hi>), written in Arabic between 942 and 968,
               has the same encyclopedic breadth as the Lexicon. Probably intended as a manual for
               travelers, it deals with issues of calendar and, among other things, lists the
               festivals and commemorative days of Christians, Muslims (arranged according to the
               lunar months), Jews, Armenians, Copts, the people of Ḥarran, and the Sabians. Of
               particular importance is Bar Bahlul’s insider information on the feasts of the Ch. of
               E. Toward the end, the scope of this work broadens; a final section on dream
               interpretation has been identified as a summary rewriting of the dream manual written
               by the Muslim author Ibn Qutayba (d. 889).</p>

                    <p>Maph. (since 1264) and polymath. Foremost representative of the <ref rend="bold">Syriac
                  Renaissance</ref> of the 12th–13th cent. Bar ʿEbroyo was born as a son of the
               physician Ahrun in <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref>. The view that links his name to a
               Jewish ancestry is best rejected in favor of one associating it with the village of
               ʿEbro on the Euphrates downstream of Melitene. After periods of study in <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, Tripoli (both then still in the hands of the Crusaders)
               and, possibly, <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>, Bar ʿEbroyo was made bp. in 1246 of
               Gubos and a little later of Laqabin (both sees in the vicinity of Melitene) by Patr.
               Ignatius III Dawid<ref rend="bold"/>(Maphr. 1215–22, Patr. 1222–52). In the schism that
               followed the death of Ignatius III, Bar ʿEbroyo sided at first with Dionysios
                  ʿAngur<ref rend="bold"/>(Patr. 1252–61) and was appointed by him in ca. 1253 to the
               see of <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>, where he was to witness the fall of the city to
               the Mongols in 1260. The synod held in Cilicia following the death of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon bar Maʿdani</ref> in 1264 saw the double election of Ignatius IV
               Yeshuʿ (Patr. 1264–82) to the patriarchate and of Bar ʿEbroyo to the maphrianate. Bar
               ʿEbroyo’s normal place of residence as maph. was <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> and the
               nearby <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>, but a significant part of his
               maphrianate was spent in Maragha and Tabriz, the new centers of power and learning
               under the Mongol Īl-Khāns, where Bar ʿEbroyo befriended the leading Muslim scholars
               of the day. During his maphrianate Bar ʿEbroyo ordained a total of twelve bishops,
               including his biographer <ref rend="bold">Diosqoros of Gozarto</ref>, and saw his
               erstwhile disciple Philoxenos Nemrod<ref rend="bold"/>(Patr. 1283–92) elected to the
               patriarchate in 1283. He also entertained a friendly relationship with his Ch. of E.
               counterparts Denḥa I (Cath. 1265–81) and <ref rend="bold">Yahbalaha III</ref>. Bar
               ʿEbroyo died in Maragha on 29/30 July 1286. His remains were later transferred to
               Dayro d-Mor Matay, where they rest to this day together with those of his younger
               brother and successor in the maphrianate, <ref rend="bold">Grigorios Barṣawmo
                  Ṣafī</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Bar ʿEbroyo composed over forty works covering a wide range of subjects, mostly in
               Syriac, but occasionally also in Arabic. Taken as a whole, Bar ʿEbroyo’s literary
               output may be seen as an attempt at a revival of learning in Syriac through the use
               of the latest scholarly literature which was available in his day mostly in Arabic.
               Bar ʿEbroyo frequently modelled his works on works of Arabic and Persian authors

               provided by these models materials taken from both Arabo-Persian and Syriac sources,
               thus making a new synthesis out of the older Syriac and more recent Arabo-Persian
               literature. Bar ʿEbroyo has often been characterised as a skillful but unoriginal
               compiler of earlier works. This is a characterization that overlooks the originality
               to be found in his choice of sources and in his openness to the knowledge found in
               the works of Islamic scholars and those of other Christian denominations. His works
               were to remain for a long time the standard texts in many fields not only among the

                    <p>Disciple of <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Kashkar</ref>; monastic leader. Bar ʿEdta is
               credited with the foundation of an important monastery, probably in 561 (or 571). The
               location of this monastery, which traditionally was assumed to be to the north of the
               village of Tarjilla, ca. 6 km. east/northeast of <ref rend="bold">Karamlish</ref> (near
                  <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>), was questioned by Fiey, who argued instead for a
               location in the district of Marga, near the river Khāzir. This monastery is said to
               have had as many as 400 monks. Bar ʿEdta’s life is known primarily through a
               metrical composition by Abraham Zabaya (from the region near the river Zab), who
               wrote at the request of the metropolitan Bp. ʿAbdishoʿ (who might have been <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</ref>, even though it cannot be ruled out that we
               are dealing with an 11th-cent. namesake). Abraham mentions as his main source a prose
               narrative by Bar ʿEdta’s disciple Yoḥannan the Persian. Bar ʿEdta also features
               prominently in <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>’s ‘Book of chastity’ and is discussed
               both in <ref rend="bold">Toma of Marga</ref>’s ‘Book of governors’ and in the Chronicle
               of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref>. Among Bar ʿEdta’s many disciples was Rabban Hormizd.
               Bar ʿEdta thus played an important role in the transmission of E.-Syr. monastic
               ideals.</p>

                    <p>Earliest known Syriac author. He was active at the court of Abgar VIII (177–212) in
                  <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, where the chronicler Julius Africanus met him in 195
                  (<hi rend="italic">Kestoi</hi> I.20), and recorded his skill at archery.
               Bardaiṣan’s name derives from that of the river Daiṣan (Greek <hi rend="italic">Skirtos</hi> ‘Leaper’) which in his day flowed through Edessa. His own writings,
               which included works against <ref rend="bold">Marcion</ref> and the Chaldeans (that is,
               astrologers), are unfortunately lost, since his views on cosmology were later
               considered unorthodox. What survives is a philosophical dialogue on fate and freewill
               in which Bardaiṣan is the protagonist; this work, probably by his pupil Philip, is
               generally known as the ‘Book of the Laws of the Countries’, due to a section on
               ethnography (whose accuracy in the passage on Ḥaṭra is now confirmed by a Ḥaṭran
               inscription, no. 281). The work was translated into Greek, and quotations from it are
               given in <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref>’s ‘<hi rend="italic">Preparation for the
                  Gospel</hi>’ (VI.10.1–48) and the ‘Pseudo-Clementine Recognitions’ (IX.19–29). His
               teaching, some of which was conveyed in verse as well as in prose, has to be
               reconstructed from later hostile sources (above all, <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>); it
               was evidently syncretistic in character, with elements drawn from Greek philosophy
               and Iranian and Gnostic cosmology; it may have served <ref rend="bold">Mani</ref> as a
               partial model. The teaching on freewill in the ‘Book of the Laws of the Countries’
               has been shown to be largely dependent on Alexander of Aphrodisias.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>A member of the <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref> in the latter part of the 6th
               cent., who may have composed two of the most important sources for this institution:
               the Ecclesiastical History and the so-called ‘Cause of the Foundation of the
               Schools’. The former is a church history, composed not long after 569, focusing on
               the 4th and 5th cent. from an E.-Syr. perspective (but relying on Western Greek
               sources). In its concluding two chapters it traces the history of the <ref rend="bold">School of Edessa</ref> and the School of Nisibis up to the death of <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref>, head of the School of Nisibis (d. 569).
               Scholars have commonly equated this text, entitled in the one surviving ms. as
               ‘History of the Holy Fathers, persecuted on account of the truth’, with the
               Ecclesiastical History mentioned by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> (see below). The
               ‘Cause’ attributed to Barḥadbshabba, composed between 581 and ca. 610, begins with a
               treatment of epistemology and then provides a history of learning from the time of
               God’s creation of the world to the period of the text’s composition in the late 6th
               cent. It recasts patriarchal, Israelite, ‘pagan’, and Christian history as a long
               series of schools, concluding with the leadership of <ref rend="bold">Ḥenana</ref>
               (ca.  572 – ca. 610), whom Barḥadbshabba views favorably.</p>
                    <p>These two texts have both been attributed to a Barḥadbshabba, but scholars have not
               agreed about his identity and whether he is one and the same person. Two contemporary
               figures named Barḥadbshabba are attested in the sources: Barḥadbshabba ʿArbaya (i.e.
               from <ref rend="bold">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>) and Barḥadbshabba of Ḥulwān (in the mountains
               northeast of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon)</ref>. Their identification is
               supported by their contemporaneity, their mutual connection to <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> and Ḥenana, the common subject matter of their surviving works, and
               the lack of positive evidence to the contrary, though it is far from certain that
               they are one and the same person. It is possible that a Barḥadbshabba from the region
               of Beth ʿArbaye came to Nisibis and was eventually consecrated
               Bp. of Ḥulwān, in which case the two are actually one and the same person, as some
               scholars believe. To the former ʿAbdishoʿ attributes: ‘a book of treasures in three
               parts, and disputes (<hi rend="italic">drāše</hi>) with all religions (<hi rend="italic">deḥlān</hi>) and their refutation, and an ecclesiastical (history),
               and a cause of the followers (Syr. <hi rend="italic">bet</hi>, or ‘school’) of
               Diodore, and a commentary (<hi rend="italic">mašlmānutā</hi>) on Mark the evangelist
               and (the psalms of) David’. A late ms. attributes a hymn to the same person (ms.
               Cambridge Or. Oo. 1. 22). Perhaps the commentary on Psalms mentioned by ʿAbdishoʿ is
               the source of the quotation attributed to a Barḥadbshabba in a later psalm commentary
               (ms. Mingana Syr. 58). <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref> cites a ‘Book of
               Treasures’, which he attributes to Barḥadbshabba the teacher (<hi rend="italic">mallpānā</hi>), probably the same person. The ‘Cause of the Followers of Diodore’
               may be a recherché reference to the ‘Cause of the Foundation of the Schools’ (since
               there were never any formal group of followers of Diodore. Presumably this is <ref rend="bold">Diodore of Tarsus</ref>). The ms. tradition of the ‘Cause’ does not help
               us identify the author, since the more reliable mss. were lost in 1915. The text
               would have been written perhaps before the mid-590s if the author is identical with
               the Barḥadbshabba who participated in opposing Ḥenana at the Synod of 605 and left
               the School some time after, particularly since Ḥenana is highly praised in the
               ‘Cause’. The Khuzistan Chronicle refers to a person by the name of Barḥadbshabba of
               Ḥulwān, known for his compositions in the early 7th cent (Guidi et al., <hi rend="italic">Chronica minora</hi> [CSCO 1], 22). The same person is also one of
               the signatories to the record for the Synod of <ref rend="bold">Grigor I</ref> of 605,
               at which the theological authority of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> was
               re-affirmed (Synodicon Orientale, 471–9). This has been taken by some scholars to be
               an implicit rejection of Ḥenana.The Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref> suggests
               that these two figures are the same, but this may be a later conflation.
               Significantly, the text states that ‘Ḥadbshabba ʿArbaya who became metropolitan of
               Ḥulwān’ was one of the members who left the School of Nisibis due to the
               controversial theology of Ḥenana. Some later sources, such as the 9th-cent. biblical
               commentator <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> and the later <ref rend="bold">Gannat
                  bussāme</ref> (‘Garden of Delights’, a commentary on the E.-Syr. lectionary) refer
               to a Barḥadbshabba without any appellation, and this may also be the same person.</p>

                    <p>A hagiographic tale of Indian (Buddhist) origin which was subsequently christianized
               (Bodisatva becomes Josaphat). Although the Greek text (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi>
               8120) is traditionally ascribed to <ref rend="bold">John of Damascus</ref>, it is now
               considered to have been translated by Euthymius the Athonite (d. 1028) from Georgian,
               which in turn derived from an Ismaili form of the story (FT by D. Gimaret, 1971).
               Although the story has been translated into many different languages, it appears that
               no Syriac version ever existed; nevertheless, it has two separate links with Syriac:
               chapter 27, a discourse by the ascetic Nachor, for the most part reuses the Apology
               of <ref rend="bold">Aristides</ref>, whose Greek original is otherwise almost entirely
               lost, but which survives in Syriac (and Armenian) translation; and secondly, two
               parables from the tale did find their way into Syriac, one of which was incorporated
               by <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> into his ‘Amusing stories’ (10, no. 382).</p>

                    <p>Controversial E.-Syr. Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>. After spending time at the
                  <ref rend="bold">School of Edessa</ref>, Barṣawma was made metropolitan bp. of
               Nisibis (ca. 459, or perhaps as early as 435) by the Cath. Babowai (457–484/6). The
               shah Peroz (457–84) showed a liking to him and may have even commissioned him to
               officiate in matters pertaining to border security, even entrusting him with troops.
               Later Miaphysite sources suggest that he used this force against his theological
               enemies, but there seems to be an exaggeration in this account. Until Gero’s work,
               scholars generally believed the W.-Syr. characterization of Barṣawma as playing an
               important role in the so-called ‘nestorianization’ of the Ch. of E. For example, <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun of Beth Arsham</ref>’s letter on the spread of Dyophysitism
               across the Sasanian Empire was published by Assemani as ‘On Barṣawma, Bishop of
               Nisibis, and the heresy of the Nestorians’, although it only mentions him twice and
               in passing. To what extent he played a central role in the propagation of Dyophysite
               Christology in the Ch. of  E. is unclear, but it seems certain that he was involved
               in some of the major ecclesiastical developments of the day. For example, he may have
               initiated the founding of the <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref>. The sources
               describe him as persuading <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref> to found the new school in
               Nisibis after the expulsion of the Dyophysites from the School of Edessa in the last
               decades of the 5th cent. Barṣawma engaged in a project of ethical reform, which
               included granting permission for clergy to marry. He later had a falling out with
               Narsai, perhaps in part due to his marriage to an ex-nun, Mamai. He openly opposed
               the Cath. Babowai and called together a synod at <ref rend="bold">Beth Lapaṭ</ref> in
               484, which did not include the Cath. This was followed by a synod at Beth ʿEdray (?)
               in 486. We have extant a letter from Barṣawma explaining his absence from the Synod
               of Mar <ref rend="bold">Aqaq</ref>, held in 486, which further addressed the issues of
               clerical marriage. <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> is vague about his
               works, citing various genres, including metrical homilies, liturgical works, and
               epistles (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, vol. 3.1, 66). Gero provides a
               possible chronology for his several extant letters.</p>

                    <p>Monk and abbot. Barṣawmo was a supporter of Dioscorus of Alexandria. In 449, invited
               by Emperor Theodosius II, he attended the Council of Ephesus, which accepted a
               profession of faith by <ref rend="bold">Eutyches</ref>. Two years later, Barṣawmo also
               was present at the Council of Chalcedon, which rejected Eutyches’s views and deposed
               Dioscorus. Barṣawmo expressed his strong opposition to the decisions of this council
               and remained opposed to the council for the rest of his life. It is explicitly stated
               that Barṣawmo spoke Syriac in both councils and that his words were translated into
               Greek.</p>
                    <p>Aside from his brief appearance at these two councils, recorded in the Greek Acts of
               the Council of Chalcedon and in the Syriac Acts of the Council of Ephesus, no further
               contemporary evidence on Barṣawmo exists. Around the middle of the 6th cent.,
               however, a Syriac Life was composed, which situates Barṣawmo’s birth in the region of
               Samosata and details his many travels to <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>, Petra, the
               Sinai, and Cyprus. Barṣawmo is portrayed as an energetic monk, converting
               non-Christians and fighting against Jews and pagans. The historical value of this
               Life, preserved in three incomplete mss. (the earliest from the 11th cent.), is
               doubtful. In his Chronicle, <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, who was abbot in the
               monastery named after Barṣawmo (see <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref>), fails
               to record many of the data provided in the Life.</p>
                    <p>Despite his acceptance of Eutyches, whose legacy was later rejected by the Syr. Orth.
               Church, Barṣawmo became a popular saint. He gave his name to the famous Monastery of
               Barṣawmo, near <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref>. Barṣawmo’s fame also spread to the
               Coptic and Ethiopian churches.</p>
                    <p>Barṣawmo is depicted in an illuminated ms. of the <ref rend="bold">Ḥarqlean</ref>
               Gospels (dated 1054) that once belonged to the Monastery of Barṣawmo and later was in
               the possession of the Syr. Orth. patriarchal library at <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref>. He
               is also portrayed in Coptic wall paintings in the Monastery of Baramus and in the
               Monastery of St. Antony. In the latter he holds an open scroll, which is inscribed
               partly in Syriac and partly in Coptic.</p>

                    <p>The monastery, situated in the mountains to the southeast of <ref rend="bold">Melitene
               </ref>and named after the 5th-cent. ascetic <ref rend="bold">Barṣawmo</ref>, rose to
               prominence as the regular residence of Syr. Orth. Patriarchs in the 11th–13th cent.,
               the period often referred to as the <ref rend="bold">Syriac Renaissance</ref>. The
               ruins of the fortified monastery have been located around a peak 1600 m high at the
               south-western end of the Kaplı Dağı, above the village of Peraş (1300  m) in the
               upper valley of the Kâhta Çayı and approximately 20 km. to the northeast of Nemrut
               Dağı, the site of the ancient sanctuary built by Antiochus I of Commagene (70–38 BC),
               whence the materials may have been brought that were used in the construction of the
               vaults of the new church of the monastery in 1186 (Honigmann, 49).</p>
                    <p>The original monastery founded by Mor Barṣawmo probably lay at the foot of the
               mountain near the Kâhta Çayı. The ‘upper’ monastery must have been built before 790
               when Patr. <ref rend="bold">Giwargis of Bʿeltan</ref>is said to have ascended there to
               die. After the large-scale movement of Syr. Orth. Christians into the area around
               Melitene in the 10th cent., Patr. Yuḥanon da-Srigteh (965–986) and Athanasios Ṣalḥoyo
               (987–1003) normally resided at the Monastery of Barid, which was probably located
               near the River Giḥun (Ceyhan) some way to the west of Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, but
               Athanasios is recorded as having died in Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, and was succeeded by
               Yuḥanon bar ʿAbdun (1004–31), a monk of that monastery. Patr. Dionysios IV (1032–42)
               was forced to seek refuge in <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref> because of persecution by
               Chalcedonians, and, with the exception of Athanasios  Ḥoye (1058–63), his immediate
               successors normally resided outside areas under Byzantine rule, but with the
               weakening of Byzantine control in the wake of the Battle of Manzikert (1071), Dayro
               d-Mor Barṣawmo and the surrounding region became once again the center stage of Syr.
               Orth. activities. Among the patriarchs from that period, Basilios III (1074–75) and
               Athanasios bar Kamore (1091–1129) were monks of Mor Barṣawmo. It is reported that
               measures were taken to strengthen the fortification of the monastery in 1101 and
               1164, measures which were necessitated by the attraction that the monastery with its
               relic of Barṣawmo and its wealth exerted not only on pilgrims but also on less
               welcome visitors, as well as by its precarious position on the border between
               Frankish and Armenian territory to the south and Turkish territory to the north.
               Among the events from the middle of the 12th cent., mention may be made of the
               plunder of the monastery by Count Joscelin II of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> in 1148
               and the synod held there in 1155 under Athanasios VI bar Qeṭreh (1138/9–66). The
               monastery saw its heyday under Patr. <ref rend="bold">Michael I Rabo</ref> (1166–99),
               who had been its abbot before his election as patr. The monastery, which became the
               regular venue for synods under Michael  I, suffered serious damage by fire in 1183.
               Michael I was succeeded as patr. by another abbot of Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, Rabban
               Ṣaliba, who as patr. took the name Athanasios (1199–1207), while his rival <ref rend="bold">Michael II the Younger</ref>, a nephew of Michael I, had also been
               educated in the monastery. Patriarchs begin to reside less frequently at Dayro d-Mor
               Barṣawmo in the following period. Ignatius III Dawid (1222–52), although originally a
               monk of the monastery, spent much of his patriarchate in Armenian and Frankish
               territory at Qalʿa Rumoyto (Hromklay, Rum Kale) and <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>. In
               the schism following his death Dionysios ʿAngur (1252–61) took up residence in the
               monastery and was joined there for a time by <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, who
               was to revisit the monastery as maphrian on at least two occasions. Patr. Ignatius IV
               Yeshuʿ (1264–83) had to engage in a long dispute over the control of the monastery
               with its abbot Yaʿqub and his influential brother Shemʿun of Qalʿa Rumoyto. His
               successor Philoxenos Nemrod (1283–92), a nephew of Shemʿun and Yaʿqub, seems normally
               to have resided in Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, which was badly damaged by an earthquake in
               1284/5, and it was there that <ref rend="bold">Barṣawmo Ṣafī</ref>, the younger brother
               of Bar ʿEbroyo, was consecrated maphrian in 1288. The monastery seems to have been
               deserted not long after the murder in 1293 of Constantine, the Melitenian patriarchal
               claimant in the three-way schism that followed the death of Philoxenos, and, after
               the extinction also of the Cilician line of patriarchs, was replaced by <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> near <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> as the normal
               residence of Syr. Orth. Patriarchs.</p>
                    <p>The 15th cent. saw a revival of Syr. Orth. activities in the area just to the east of
               Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, centred around the town of Gargar (modern Gerger) and the
               Monastery of Mor Abḥai. Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, too, was reoccupied at that time, as is
               indicated by a number of manuscripts dated between 1463 and 1675 that either mention
               or were copied in Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo. There has been yet another revival of Syr.
               Orth. communities in the area in recent years, leading to the appointment of a
               metropolitan for Adıyaman (former Ḥisn Manṣūr) in 2006.</p>
                    <p>Another Syr. Orth. monastery dedicated to Mor Barṣawmo was the ‘little monastery’
                  (<hi rend="italic">dayrunitho</hi>) of Mor Barṣawmo near Kfartuto to the southwest
               of Mardin, which is attested in 12th–13th cent. and was situated between the villages
               of Bagdashiyya (modern Bektaş) and Ḥashray (modern Dikmen) (Honigmann, 44–5; and
               colophons of mss. Vat. Syr. 147 and Yale, Syriac 10).</p>

               Barṣawmo was no doubt in the company of his elder brother for most of the time during
               the latter’s maphrianate and was with him when he died in Maragha in 1286. Barṣawmo
               was consecrated Maph. of the East two years later on 3 July 1288, taking the
               episcopal name of ‘Gregory’ in remembrance of his brother, and ruled over his flock
               in a time of increasing political instability and persecutions for the Christians.
               Barṣawmo died in Barṭelle in 1307/8, and was entombed in Dayro d-Mor Matay alongside
               his brother. Besides the continuations of his brother’s historical works, Barsoum
               ascribes to Barṣawmo an abridgement of the Anaphora of St. John the Evangelist.</p>

               from distinguished families of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, and was named Ayyoub. He
               studied as a child at the Dominican School in Mosul and then taught there after he
               graduated. He also studied Arabic literature and rhetoric at the hands of a local
               Muslim <hi rend="italic">imām</hi>. He joined <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>
               where he was tonsured a monk in 1907 and named Afram after St. <ref rend="bold">Ephrem
               </ref>the Syrian, and later was ordained a priest in 1908. He taught at the school of
               the monastery, and became director of its <ref rend="bold">printing</ref> press in
               1911. In 1913, he embarked on a scholarly trip in the <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>

               represented his church at the Paris Peace Conference and embarked on a second
               scholarly trip across Europe where he spent 17 months visiting libraries that hold
               Syriac mss. In 1927, he embarked on a third scholarly trip visiting Europe and the
               US, where he consecrated three churches in Worcester, MA, Patterson, NJ, and Rhode
               Island. During his stay there, he visited the University of Chicago where he worked
               at the Oriental Institute. In 1932 he became a member of the Syrian Academy. In 1933,
               he was elected and consecrated Patr., and transferred the Patriarchate to Ḥimṣ. He
               established in 1939 the Seminary of Saint Ephrem. He authored numerous books,

                    <p>Educator, modern writer, and translator of liturgical texts into English. He was born
               an orphan in Miden (his father perished in a storm on his way to purchase a sack of
               wheat from a nearby village while his mother was pregnant with him). His mother died
               a few hours after giving birth to him, after which his grandmother took care of him.
               His family immigrated to Palestine after World War I. After a rough childhood, his
               family entrusted him to the care of <ref rend="bold">St. Mark’s Monastery</ref> in
               1925. There he studied Syriac under <ref rend="bold">Dolabani</ref>. Barsoum published
               a small pedagogical reader at the age of fifteen, and taught at the Syr. Orth.
               schools of <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>, Bethlehem, and Amman. During World War II,
               he worked as an interpreter for the British Government for the <ref rend="bold">Assyrians</ref> who were then deported from Iraq. After the Arab-Israeli war of
               1948, Barsoum became a refugee for the third time and lived in Bethlehem. In 1955 he
               immigrated to Jordan and in 1966 to the USA. In 1984, he went on a pilgrimage to his
               homeland <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> with <ref rend="bold">Athanasios Yeshuʿ
                  Samuel</ref>. He died in Los Angeles in 1996. His family established a small
               library to contain his library at St. Ephrem’s Cathedral, Burbank. His works include
               a pedagogical reader (Jerusalem, 1927); translations into English of the orders of
               baptism, matrimony, and burial (1974), and thirteen Anaphoras (1991); editions, with
               English translation, of a short daily prayer book (1993), and a prayer book for the
               clergy (1993). His other writings remain unpublished.</p>

               suffered destruction in the past and during the invasion of Nādir Shāh in the middle

                    <p>1. ‘Homilies on the Hexaemeron’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2835): ed. with ET, R. W.
               Thomson (CSCO 550–1; 1995). This early (and rather free) translation was in turn
               translated into Armenian.</p>
                    <p>2. ‘Treatise on the Holy Spirit’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2839): ed. with ET, D.
               G. K. Taylor (CSCO 576–7; 1999). Only the older version is preserved complete, in
               three very old mss.; of the later version there are only quotations.</p>
                    <p>3. Homilies (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2845–69): these are mostly preserved in both
               an early and a later translation; they remain unpublished. Some of these homilies
               were incorporated into the liturgical Homiliaries.</p>
                    <p>4. Small Asceticon (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2876): the Syriac version, which is
               entitled ‘Questions to the Brethren’, is a particularly important witness to this
               work, since the only other witness is the Latin translation by Rufinus (d. ca. 401),
               the Greek original having been lost (only the Great Asceticon survives in Greek). The
               early Syriac translation, preserved in a number of early mss., has not yet been
               published apart from excerpts (by J. Gribomont).</p>
                    <p>5. Letters (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2900). 18 Letters from Basil’s very large
               correspondence survive in Syriac translation. Letter 2, addressed to <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, on the monastic life, was much read, to judge by the
               number of mss. preserving it (some mss. identify the addressee as Gregory of Nyssa,
               and in others a further text of unknown origin has been added to it). Only two of the
               Letters have so far been published: Letter 38 (in fact probably not by Basil but by
               his brother Gregory of Nyssa, <hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 3196), by M. Parmentier, in
                  <hi rend="italic">Studien zu Gregor von Nyssa</hi>, ed. H.  Drobner and C. Klock
               (1990), 17–55. and (independently) M. Albert, in <hi rend="italic">ARAM</hi> 5
               (1993), 33–64; and Letter 160, by A. Vööbus, in <hi rend="italic">The Synodicon in
                  the West Syrian Tradition</hi> (CSCO 367–8; 1975), 189–94 (Syr.), 178–82 (ET). (An
               edition of Letter 2 is in preparation).</p>
                    <p>6. A few texts attributed to Basil in Syriac are unknown in Greek. This applies to:
               a. A homily against the Anomoeans (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2988.14 Suppl.), ed.
               with LT by A. Van Roey, in <hi rend="italic">OLP</hi> 28 (1997), 179–91. b. 6
               letters, one of which, addressed to the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Tell ʿAda</ref>,
               has been edited by M. Albert, in <hi rend="italic">After Bardaisan</hi>, ed. Reinink
               and Klugkist(OLA 89), 11–22. c. A narrative poem, clearly composed in Syriac, on the
               biblical patriarch Joseph and his brothers; this has been published in two parts, by
               M. Weinberg (1893) and S. W. Link (1895). ET by K. Heal in preparation; there are
               Arabic and Ethiopic translations.</p>
                    <p>7. Various liturgical texts are ascribed to Basil in Syriac: a. A translation of the
               Greek Anaphora of Basil, found in Rum Orthodox liturgical mss.; b. A (different) Syr.
               Orth, and Maron. Anaphora; c. The Melkite (Rum Orthodox) baptismal rite; d. A short
               Maronite baptismal rite.</p>
                    <p>Besides works by Basil, Syriac also preserves some hagiographical texts concerning
               Basil.</p>
                    <p>He is commemorated on 1 Jan.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Missionary and scholar. Paul Bedjan was born and raised in Khosrowa, northwest Iran,
               in a Chald. family with strong ties to the Lazarist mission (St. Vincent de Paul)
               whose missionaries had established themselves in that town in 1840. Bedjan received
               his primary education at their seminary and in 1856 traveled to Paris to enter the
               order and continue his education. In 1861 he returned to Iran where he worked as a
               missionary until 1880, when he left again for Europe, living in Paris,
               Ans-les-Lièges, Seraing (Belgium), and Köln Nippes (Germany), never to return to
               Iran. Several times Iranian clergy and lay people attempted to make Bedjan bp. of
               Khosrowa, but due to opposition from the Chald. patriarchate in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, partly the result of the discussions that surrounded Bedjan’s
               edition of the Chaldean Breviary, as well as to Bedjan’s preference for Europe, this
               never materialized. Despite his estrangement from the Chald. hierarchy and his
               latinizing tendencies, Bedjan succeeded in the prime object of his stay in Europe: to
               provide books for the Chald. community in Iran, among other things to counteract the
               influence of the publications of the Protestant press in <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref>.
               He published thirty-two classical Syriac works and wrote eight books in the
               vernacular language of Urmia, as it had developed in the first half of the 19th cent.
               These include a translation of the ‘Imitation of Christ’ of Thomas à Kempis (1885), a
               retelling of the Bible (<hi rend="italic">Histoire Sainte</hi>, 1888), devotional
               texts on Mary (<hi rend="italic">Mois de Marie</hi>, 1904) and a shortened version of
               the Saints’ lives (<hi rend="italic">Vies des Saints</hi>, 1912). It was through his
               classical Syriac editions, among which the seven-volume collection of Saints’ Lives,
               the History of Mar Yahbalaha, and works of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Toma of Marga</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, that his name became known also to western
               scholars, with some of whom he co-operated. All of his books were published by Otto
               Harrasowitz in Leipzig and/or in Paris and shipped in thousands to the Middle
               East.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Situated ca. 36 km. southeast of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, Dayro d-Mor Behnam
               contains the only full program of medieval church decoration that survives to this
               day in Iraq. The monastery consists of a fortress-like complex, the main buildings of
               which are the monastic church and a separate octagonal mausoleum housing the relics
               of Mor Behnam, which is commonly referred to as either the ‘Pit’ or the ‘Outside
               Martyrion’. The entire complex is known in Syriac as <hi rend="italic">Beth
                  Gubbā</hi>, and in Arabic as <hi rend="italic">Dayr al-Jubb</hi>, ‘Monastery of
               the Pit’. According to the legend of Mor Behnam (ed. P. Bedjan, <hi rend="italic">AMS</hi>, vol. II, 397–441), the monastery was built in the 4th cent. on the site
               of the graves of the martyrs Behnam and his sister Sarah. The first secure evidence
               for its existence is encountered in the 12th cent., in the first place in a
               dedicatory inscription which states that the ‘altar’ (probably meaning the entire
               altar room) was reconstructed in 1164, which suggests that the church existed well
               before this date. These reconstruction activities may have occasioned the writing
               down of the legend of Mor Behnam. The oldest written account is preserved in a Syr.
               Orth. ms. (London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,174), which was copied in 1197 for <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref> near <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref>, and
               contains a note by Patr. <ref rend="bold">Michael I Rabo</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Whatever the exact nature of the restoration work executed at Dayro d-Mor Behnam in
               1164, less than a century later the monastery was the site of large-scale
               refurbishment activities, probably through the involvement of monks from <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>, with which the monastery appears to have
               maintained close administrative and economic ties. Most of the monastic church’s
               extensive sculptural decoration and architectural features closely resemble those
               encountered in monuments dating from the reign of Badr al-Dīn Luʾluʾ, the Atabeg
               ruler of Mosul, and may therefore be dated between ca. 1233 and 1259. Obviously
               benefiting from the economic and cultural boom in the Mosul area during this period,
               the interior and exterior of the church were both provided with new stone carving.
               Three domes with interior stucco decoration probably also date from this period of
               artistic activity. In addition to motifs familiar from contemporary Islamic contexts,
               such as lions and dragons, the decoration program conveys distinctively Christian
               themes, including equestrian saints, martyrs, and monks, as well as two scenes based
               on the life of Mor Behnam.</p>
                    <p>Along with the extensive figural decoration, the numerous <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref> situated on the walls of the monastic church and the
               mausoleum, which date from the 12th through the 20th cent. are of particular
               importance to the study of Syriac Christianity. Mainly written in Syriac, but also in
               Arabic, Armenian, and Uighur, these inscriptions not only include liturgical texts
               and biblical verses, but also historical information, as well as names of artists and
               patrons. According to one of these inscriptions, the monastery was looted in 1295 by
               the invading Mongol army of Khan Baidu. The abbot of the monastery was subsequently
               able to persuade Baidu not only to return all the stolen objects, but even to make a
               donation, which was apparently used for the construction of a new grave for the
               relics of Mor Behnam, built in the mausoleum in 1300. In the 15th and 16th cent.,
               several Maphrians chose Dayro d-Mor Behnam as their seat, including Diosqoros Behnam
               II (1415–17), whose grave is still found in the monastery’s burial room. In 1579/80,
               Maphr. Basilius Pilatus (1576–91) wrote a letter from the monastery to Pope Gregory
               XIII (1572–85) in which he expressed interest in establishing a formal union with the
               Church of Rome.</p>
                    <p>Having suffered a long period of decline, the monastery was finally brought under the
               jurisdiction of the <ref rend="bold">Syriac Catholic Church</ref>in 1839, but continued
               to lead a poor existence until 1936, when Ephrem Abdal established a new community of
               monks there. In addition to revitalizing Dayro d-Mor Behnam’s library, superior Abdal
               (1936–66) initiated the first of a series of large-scale restorations, which were
               continued by his successors, in particular during the 1980s and 1990s. Today, the
               monastery is one of the most flourishing Christian sites in the Mosul area.</p>

                    <p>Beirut, Lebanon is mentioned in many Syr. Orth. texts in connection with the St. Jude
               monastery and church. It was described by <ref rend="bold">Zacharias Rhetor</ref>in his
               ‘Life of <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref>’, the Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>
               (512–38). Although Zacharias wrote originally in Greek, his text survives only in
               Syriac translation. The author narrates Severus’s conversion to Christianity while
               both he and Severus were studying at the famous School of Law in 487–91, and he gives
               a lively description of the lives of young Christians in 5th cent. Beirut. He
               mentions four churches in Beirut among which was a ‘venerable church of the holy
               apostle Jude, brother of James who were both sons of Joseph’. It was located outside
               of Beirut and had a community of ascetics, priests, and monks. Different sources show
               that the community was anti-Chalcedonian. Severus himself in one of his letters
               reports that in 482–83, when <ref rend="bold">Peter the Iberian</ref>, a popular
               anti-Chalcedonian figure in Palestine, passed by Beirut, he prayed in ‘the glorious
               church of the famous martyr and apostle Jude, brother of James who is buried in
               Berytus’. In the early Syr. Orth. tradition, therefore, Beirut’s church of St. Jude
               was known for being a martyrium church as well as having an anti-Chalcedonian stance.
               Medieval Syr. Orth. authors like <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>and <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> support these claims. The monastery apparently survived the
               earthquake of 551 that destroyed Beirut entirely, including its famous Law School,
               although Michael Rabo in his Chronicle describes the effects of the earthquake
               without mentioning the church. It was probably rebuilt eventually by Syr. Orth. monks
               because in a 12th cent. papal letter a church of St. Jude in Beirut is mentioned,
               which was put under the jurisdiction of the Latin bishop of the city. The church was
               destroyed by the army of Ṣalāḥ al-dīn al-Ayyūbī who occupied Beirut for ten years
               (1187–97), for when the German pilgrim Wilbrand of Oldenburg visited Beirut in
               1211–12, he found only the tombs of Jude and his brother Simon in place of the
               monastery outside the walls of the city.</p>
                    <p>A <ref rend="bold">Maronite</ref> presence in Beirut is mentioned for the first time in
               a papal confirmation of 1184. It reports that the Latin bishop of Beirut gave the
               Maronites a chapel with adjacent land (see Pringle). This may have been the church of
               Saint Georges located northeast of the city and cited by an anonymous Rhenan pilgrim
               in 1098. It is there, the pilgrim affirms, that long ago Saint George killed the
               dragon. Under the Ottomans in the 16th cent., the Maronites were in possession of
               that church with an adjacent cemetery where their bishops were buried (Duwayhī). In
               the course of the 17th cent. they lost this church, which became the mosque of
               al-Khidr. Another Maronite church was located within the walls of Beirut, but it was
               taken from them in 1571 by the ruling local emir Manṣūr ʿAssāf in the aftermath of
               his participation in the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus. ʿAssāf seized the church, but
               the Maronites did not leave, and they even named their first known bishop of Beirut a
               few years later, in 1577. Maronite bps. were named for Beirut but did not reside in
               the city, staying instead in different monasteries of the Kisrawān and the Matn
               districts near the capital. In 1736 the Council of Luwayza mentioned eight Maronite
               dioceses among which the Beirut diocese included the Matn, the Jurd, and the Gharb up
               to Jisr al-Qādī near Dāmūr. Around 1748, the emir Yūssif Murād Abillamā authorized
               the general abbot of the Antonine Order to build a monastery in old Beirut and Bp.
               Mikhāʾil Fādil built the small cathedral church of Saint Georges in 1753, which was
               renovated, destroyed, and rebuilt many times but still stands today in the center of
               Beirut. The Maronite see of Beirut was built by Bp. Tubiyā ʿAwn (1844–71) near the
               cathedral, and his successor <ref rend="bold">Yūsuf al-Dibs</ref> (1872–1907)
               transferred it near al-Ḥikma School, where it still is today. The Lebanese civil war
               (1975–90) greatly affected the Maronite diocese of Beirut, which numbered 140
               churches before 1975 but lost 62 during the war as a result of the evacuation of
               Christians from 60 villages.</p>
                    <p>As for the Syr. Orth., a new diocese was created in the 19th cent., when refugees
               from Diyarbakır, <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>
               began to arrive in Lebanon, followed in the 20th cent. by those coming from Adana,
               Tarsus, and <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>. Beirut also became an important center for
               the Syr. Cath. Church, which transferred its patriarchal residence from Mardin to
               Beirut under Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref> (1898–1929) and had
               its main seminary in <ref rend="bold">Sharfeh</ref>. In the second half of the 20th
               cent. Beirut also became an episocopal see for the Chald. Church (with <ref rend="bold">Raphael Bidawid</ref> as its most notable incumbent, between 1966 and 1989) as
               well as for the Ch. of E.</p>

               Benjamin was monk in the Monastery of Mor Yaʿqub (most likely in Kaysum). Later in
               his life he was found teaching at the monasteries of Eusebona (833/4) and Tell ʿAda
               (836/7, when in his capacity of <hi rend="italic">Rabban d-dogma</hi>, ‘professor of
               dogma’, he was there for a period of retreat: <hi rend="italic">kawšo
                  d-tawtobutho</hi>). Benjamin’s work is known to us in the commentaries written
               down by his disciples, who mention him in their colophons. One of them was Daniel
               (see ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,725; Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue … British
                  Museum</hi>, vol. 2, 442). An anonymous commentary on the first volume of Gregory
               is said to have been written ‘according to the tradition’ (<hi rend="italic">mašlmonutho</hi>) of Mar Benjamin (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 17,197; Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue … British Museum</hi>, vol. 2, 441a).</p>
                    <p>While the W.-Syr. information on Benjamin seems to be limited to his work on Gregory
               of Nazianzus (with the exception of a quotation by <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar
                  Ṣalibi</ref>, mentioned by Barsoum), <ref rend="bold">Bar Bahlul</ref> knows a

               to whom on two occasions he specifically attributes a commentary on Dionysius (ed.
               Duval, 475.9–10 and 1383.6–7). In all likelihood we are dealing with the same person.
               (This Benjamin is clearly to be distinguished from the allegedly 4th-cent. monk of
               that name; see Fiey, <hi rend="italic">Saints syriaques</hi>, 56.)</p>
                    <p>A letter of ‘Benjamin, bp. of Edessa, concerning reasons (<hi rend="italic">ʿellotho</hi>) for the Eucharist and baptism’, is preserved in ms. Brit. Libr.

                    <p>This famous monastery was founded in 595/6 by Yaʿqub, a monk of the ‘Great Monastery’
               of <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Kashkar</ref> (on the mountain of Izla), who originated
               from Lashom in <ref rend="bold">Beth Garmai</ref>. Along with others Yaʿqub had been
               banished from the Great Monastery by <ref rend="bold">Babai</ref>for countenancing what
               Babai regarded as monastic laxity. The monastery that Yaʿqub founded was evidently
               near the village of Kherpa, to the northwest of ʿAqra (thus Fiey, against Budge); it
               must have been in or near an earlier inhabited site named Beth ʿAbe since <hi rend="italic">Bethaba</hi>is mentioned in Ptolemy’s ‘Geography’ (VI.1.4). The
               history of the monastery up to 832 is exceptionally well documented thanks to the
               account of its first 20 abbots by <ref rend="bold">Toma of Marga</ref>, himself
               originally a monk of Beth ʿAbe. The monastery was especially flourishing in the mid
               7th cent. when the future Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III</ref>endowed it with
               land and built it a larger church, the monastic community having grown from 80 to
               300. Toma relates that the patr. also left to the monastery ‘a golden Gospel’
               (perhaps a Gospel lectionary with some rubrics in gold, surviving examples of which
               are known from the 13th cent.). One of the most famous monks of the monastery was the
               compiler of the ‘Paradise of the Fathers’, <ref rend="bold">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>, who also
               assisted Ishoʿyahb III in his liturgical reforms. Many interesting details of the
               history and life of the monastery are provided by Toma (summarized by Budge,
               xli–xcvii). After 832 the history of the monastery is very little known, though a
               number of 13th-cent. mss. which were written there survive (Fiey, 247; a high quality
               one is a Gospel Lectionary of 1218, now Chester Beatty [Dublin], ms.4; Hatch, <hi rend="italic">Album of Dated Syriac Mss</hi>., plate CLXXI). The monastery may
               possibly have lasted until the 16th cent.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Ecclesiastical province of the Ch. of E., situated in Central Iraq. It had the
               patriarchal see of <ref rend="bold">Kokhe</ref>, or <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, as its administrative and spiritual center. Its name
               points to a significant presence of <ref rend="bold">Arameans</ref> or speakers of <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref> in the region. The Persian name Asuristan (or Asorestan),
               which is preserved in some Arabic sources as well as in Armenian, may be a
               translation of the Aramaic name. In a letter of <ref rend="bold">Barṣawma of
                  Nisibis</ref>, dated 484, it is reported that there was a ‘<hi rend="italic">marzbān</hi> (i.e. governor) of Beth Aramaye’ (Chabot, 527.3; FT 533), who must
               have been a Sasanian official (Christensen, 136–40).</p>
                    <p>In the Synod of 410 (see <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq</ref>) only one bp. is mentioned under
               the jurisdiction of the bp. of Seleucia-Ctesiphon (later: Catholicos), namely the bp.
               of Kashkar, who is the bp. of Seleucia-Ctesiphon’s right hand and assistant as well
               as the caretaker of his see after his death (Canon 21: Chabot, 33.15; FT 272). But
               four more dioceses of Beth Aramaye are known for the early 5th cent.: Zabe, <ref rend="bold">Ḥirta</ref>, Dayra d-Qunni, and Dasqarta d-Malka (Fiey 1968, 148; map
               facing p. 152), while slightly later sources provide several additional names. Fiey
               (1968, 151–261) distinguishes between the ‘Persian’ and the ‘Arab’ dioceses. The
               ‘Persian’ dioceses, tracing their origin back to the Sasanian period, include: 1.
               Kashkar-Wāsiṭ; 2. Dayra d-Qunni (said to be the earliest monastery in Beth Aramaye),
               Beth Daraye, and Beth Kusaye; 3. Zabe (al-Zawābi, i.e. the region between Seleucia
               and Kashkar), al-Nuʿmāniyya, and Dayr Ḥazqiel); 4. Dasqarta d-Malka (ca. 88 km.
               northeast of <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>); 5. Ḥirta, ʿĀqūlā, and <ref rend="bold">Nagran</ref> (named after Nagran in S. Arabia); 6.  Peruz Shapur, later known as
                  <ref rend="bold">al-Anbār</ref>. The ‘Arab’ dioceses emerged under Abbasid rule.
               They include: 1.  al-Qaṣr, between Baghdad and al-Kūfa; 2. Niffar (ancient Nippur)
               and al-Nīl; 3. ʿAbdāsi and Nahrgūr, both in the southeast of Iraq; 4. al-Rādhān,
               al-Baradān, and Beth Dārūn (of uncertain location, not far from Baghdad). In the
               later Islamic period, dioceses of Beth Aramaye were repeatedly amalgamated. By the
               14th cent., Syr. Christianity had largely disappeared from Central Iraq. It was the
               north of Iraq that gradually became the center of the Ch. of E. (Wilmshurst, <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical Organisation</hi>, 344). The name ‘Beth Aramaye’ lost
               its relevance.</p>
                    <p>While both Persian and Arabic must have existed in the region from an early period
               onwards, in Syriac sources the inhabitants of Beth Aramaye were called <hi rend="italic">Ārāmāye</hi> ‘Arameans’ (most often to be distinguished from <hi rend="italic">Armāye</hi> ‘pagans’), sing. <hi rend="italic">Ārāmāyā</hi>, i.e.
               ‘from Beth Aramaye’ (this usage thus coexisted with a different and broader use of
               the term for the Aramaic language and ethnicity in general). <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  Bahlul</ref>, in his Lexicon, quotes some peculiar forms of the Aramaic language
               of Beth Aramaye, which he, therefore, did not see as identical to Classical Syriac.
               Fiey (1990) has pointed out that in the Islamic period much of the content of the
               term ‘Beth Aramaye’ was transferred to the Arabic name ‘Nabaṭ’ (even though the
               ‘Nabaṭ’ of Central Iraq were distinguished from different groups of ‘Nabaṭ’, esp. in
               Arabia and Syria; see also Nöldeke). The Arabic term <hi rend="italic">nabṭī</hi>
               also carried some of the connotations of ‘Aramean’ and ‘Aramaic’ and even was
               occasionally used, both by Christians and Muslims, as a substitute for ‘Aramaic’.
               This occurs, e.g., in <ref rend="bold">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref>’s ‘Paradise of Christianity’
               (commenting on the first language of the world) and in a related passage in Ibn
               al-Nadīm’s <hi rend="italic">Fihrist</hi> (Fiey 1990, 83–84; cf. K. Samir, ‘Théodore
               de Mopsueste dans le «Fihrist» d’Ibn an-Nadīm’, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 90 [1977],
               355–63). <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, in his <hi rend="italic">Mukhtaṣar</hi>,
               is aware that the Aramaic language (<hi rend="italic">nabṭiyya</hi>) of Central Iraq
               is different from the Syriac of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref> as well as from ‘Palestinian’ Aramaic (quoted in Fiey 1990, 86), but
               it is not clear whether he speaks about the situation of his own day or rather
               reflects notions of a much earlier period.</p>

                    <p>Ecclesiastical province extending from Beth Zabdai northward, <ref rend="bold">Balad</ref> southward, and <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> westward, the latter
               being its capital city. The trade route linking southern Mesopotamia with Syria and
               Egypt passed though this region from at least the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC,
               with Nisibis (Akkadian <hi rend="italic">Naṣībīna</hi>) serving as a caravan center.
               The region corresponds more or less to the Jazīra (lit. ‘island’) of the Arabic
               sources, enclosed by the Tigris and Euphrates. Arabs are attested in this region from
               Assyrian times, and it was the home of the Tanukhites during the Christian era, hence
               its Syriac name ‘Land of the Arabs’. The Synod of 410 established Beth ʿArbaye as an
               E.-Syr. metropolitan province, the second after the province of Elam. The province
               included such cities and regions as Beth Zabdai, Qardu, and Balad, and by the 13th
               cent. it also included Armenia. The long list of E.-Syr. metropolitans in Nisibis
               gives evidence of uninterrupted succession, beginning probably with <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> and ending with another Yaʿqub in the year 1616. Beth
               ʿArbaye was also the home of a large Syr. Orth. community as early as the mid 6th
               cent., the time of <ref rend="bold">Aḥudemmeh</ref> ‘Bishop of Beth ʿArbaye’ who became
               Metropolitan of the East in 559. When Metropolitan <ref rend="bold">Marutha</ref>
               settled in <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref> in 629, the titles ‘of Beth ʿArbaye’ and ‘of
               Tagrit’ became interchangeable.</p>

                    <p>An ecclesiastical province confined between the Lower Zab northward, the Tigris
               westward, the Diyālā river southward, and the mountains of Ḥimrīn eastward. Its
               capital city is Karka ‘The Fortress’ or Karkh Slokh ‘Fortress of Seleucus’, modern
               Kirkuk. Its earlier center was Shahr-gird ‘City of the King’, a town located to the
               east of Kirkuk, though its exact location is not known. Beth Garmai may have been a
               Metropolitan see from the 3rd cent., if not earlier, having its center possibly at
               Shahr-gird, but in any case it was made so at the synod of 410. The earliest three
               bishops of Karka lived during the reign of Shapur II (309–79) and were martyred by
               him, and the last bp. served the province at least until 1318. After the first
               quarter of the 9th cent., the see was transferred from Karka to Shahrzur to the east
               of Beth Garmai, and then to Daquqa. Shahrzur, an E.-Syr. bishopric seat as early as
               the 6th cent., was also the seat of a Syr. Orth. bp. under the jurisdiction of <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref> during the 7th and 8th cent. During the early 19th cent., a
               Chald. diocese was created in Kirkuk that exists to this day.</p>

                    <p>Chief city of Beth Huzaye/Khuzistan, whose metropolitan bishopric ranked second after
               that of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>. Its ruins are near Sahabad, between
               Tustar and Dezful. Beth Lapaṭ was (re-)founded soon after the sack of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> (256) by Shapur I (241–272) with the name Gondeshapur (‘Shapur’s
               Antioch is better’), and was settled with prisoners from the Roman Empire. Among the
               captives was the bp. of Antioch, Demetrianus, and the episcopal line of Beth Lapaṭ
               will have commenced with him. It was at Beth Lapaṭ, one of the Shah’s summer
               residences, that <ref rend="bold">Mani</ref> was put to death in 276/7. Beth Lapaṭ
               produced several martyrs during the persecutions of Shapur II, one being bp. Gadyab
               (mentioned by Sozomen, Ecclesiastical History, II.13), who, according to the early
               Life of Miles, consecrated Miles as bp. of Susa. At the Synod of Seleucia-Ctesiphon
               of 410 the metropolitan of Beth Lapaṭ features first in the list of metropolitan
               sees, and later <ref rend="bold">Mar Aba</ref> specifies that he should preside over
               the election of a new Cath. (<hi rend="italic">Synodicon Orientale</hi>, 543–44, tr.
               554). In 410 its suffragan dioceses are listed as Karka d-Ledan, Hormizd Ardashir
               (Ahwaz), Shushterin (Tustar), and Shush (Susa); later additions were Ram Hormizd and
               Mihraqan Qadaq (linked with Ispahan in the synod of 497). It was at Beth Lapaṭ that
               bp. <ref rend="bold">Barsawma of Nisibis</ref> convened his rebel synod in 484, whose
               acts were later annulled in 486. A theological school is known to have existed in
               Beth Lapaṭ in the late Sasanian Empire; whether or not it also had a medical school
               attached (as was the case at <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> at the end of the 6th
               cent.) is disputed (see Reinink). Such a school is definitely attested for the early
               Abbasid period by <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>’s Letter 13 (ed. Braun, CSCO 74,
               108), and is implied by al-Manṣūr’s summoning of Gewargis, of the Bokhtishoʿ family
               (see <ref rend="bold">Gabriel bar Bokhtisho</ref>ʿ) in Beth Lapaṭ, to be his physician
               in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>. By this time the metropolitan see was known as that
               of Elam. Apart from the names of a number of its bishops little is known of the later
               history of Beth Lapaṭ, and the see evidently came to an end some time in the 14th
               cent. (For a synoptic list of bishops of Beth Lapaṭ and its dioceses, see C. and F.

                    <p>An E.-Syr. bishopric seat the heartland of which was the region extending from the
               small Khabur river to the Tigris, including the area of modern Zakho and part of
               Dehok. Administratively, it was under the jurisdiction of the Metr. see of <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref> established at the synod of 410. By the middle of the 6th
               cent. the diocese included the important plain of <ref rend="bold">Nineveh</ref>, a
               more or less triangular region confined between the Tigris, the Upper Zab, the
               Khāzir, and the Gomal. After the expansion of the Syr. Orth. community in the plain
               of Nineveh during the same century and the creation of their own Beth Nuhadra, the
               E.-Syr. diocese was restricted to the northern and the eastern regions of its former
               domain. The E.-Syr. bishops are attested from the early 5th to the middle of the 13th
               cent. The bishops of the Syr. Orth. Beth Nuhadra are known between the end of the 6th
               cent. and the 8th cent., residing first in the Monastery of Nardos (modern Dayr
               Jundī) and then in Maʿalta. In modern times, the reduced Beth Nuhadra is the domain
               of the Chald. bp. who resides in Zakho.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>The region known in Syriac as Beth Qaṭraye includes not only the peninsula of Qaṭar,
               but also its hinterland Yamāma, and the entire coast of northeast Arabia as far as
               the peninsula of Musandam, in present-day Oman, along with the islands. Christianity
               must have reached Beth Qaṭraye no later than the 4th cent. Eliya, Bp. of Mashmahig,
               was present at the first Synod of the Ch. of E., in <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> (410), while another bp. of Mashmahig was deposed and
               excommunicated at the same synod. From the 6th cent. onwards, in addition to
               Mashmahig, there were bishops in Dayrin, Mazun, Hagar, and Ḥaṭṭa. Initially they were
               under the control of the metropolitan of Rev Ardashir, in <ref rend="bold">Fars</ref>,
               until Beth Qaṭraye obtained its own metropolitan, whose existence is attested only in
               676.</p>
                    <p>Most of the information on Beth Qaṭraye pertains to the early Islamic period. Among
               the correspondence of Cath. <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> (649–59), five letters
               deal with troubles in Beth Qaṭraye. The background is the rebellion of metropolitan
                  <ref rend="bold">Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir</ref> against the Cath.; this triggered an
               uprising among the bishops of Beth Qaṭraye, who likewise turned their back on the
               Cath. Among Ishoʿyahb III’s preserved letters one is addressed to the bishops, two to
               the Christians in general, and two to the monks. Although the details are not known,
               the rebellion had come to an end in 676, when Cath. <ref rend="bold">Gewargis</ref>
               (659–80) went to Beth Qaṭraye for a local synod. Very little is known of the
               subsequent history of Beth Qaṭraye; Christianity may have disappeared from the region
               after the 9th cent.</p>
                    <p>In the 6th and 7th cent., Christian Beth Qaṭraye produced a number of important
               Syriac authors. Most well known among them is the ascetic and mystical author <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>, who was born and lived for some time in Beth
               Qaṭraye, before Cath. Gewargis took him to <ref rend="bold">Beth Aramaye</ref>. After a
               short-lived episcopate in <ref rend="bold">Nineveh</ref>, he withdrew to eremitic life
               in Beth Huzaye. Another very important ascetic author from this region is <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref>. Among the various authors designated as <ref rend="bold">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref> in the sources, there is a biblical interpreter,
               who was a teacher in Seleucia-Ctesiphon in the mid-7th cent., and a commentator on
               the <ref rend="bold">liturgy</ref>, who lived in the first half of the 7th cent. The
               latter Gabriel’s work on the liturgy probably was the main source for the short
               commentary attributed to <ref rend="bold">Abraham Qaṭraya bar Lipeh</ref>. Another
               biblical interpreter frequently quoted in later sources is <ref rend="bold">Aḥob
                  Qaṭraya</ref>.</p>
                    <p>While Christians in Beth Qaṭraye used Syriac as their literary and liturgical
               language, Persian and Arabic must have existed in the region as well. This linguistic
               complexity is reflected in a few dozen glosses, explicitly identified as being in
               the ‘language of Beth Qaṭraye’ (in some cases the adverb <hi rend="italic">qaṭrāʾit</hi> is used) and preserved in later works, esp. in biblical
               commentaries and in the Lexicon of <ref rend="bold">Bar Bahlul</ref>. Some of these
               glosses are attributed to the biblical interpreters Gabriel and Aḥob Qaṭraya. While
               some can be identified as Aramaic, others point to a Persian (Pahlavi or
               proto-Neo-Persian) or to an Arabic origin. Users of this language must have been
               among the readers and writers of Syriac texts in Bet Qaṭraye.</p>
                    <p>Christians from Beth Qaṭraye also served as translators. The Persian translator for
               the (undoubtedly Arabic speaking) Laḥmid king al-Nuʿmān III (579–601) is said to have
               been a Christian from Beth Qaṭraye. A monk from Beth Qaṭraye is credited with the
               translation from Persian into Syriac of the Law Book of Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir.</p>

                    <p>Carmelite priest, scholar of the Ch. of E. and of E.-Syr. mysticism. He was born in
               Paris, entered the Carmelite order in 1945, was ordained in 1953, and in 1958 went to
                  <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> to the Carmelite mission, which had been founded
               there in the 17th cent. He was professor of dogmatic theology at the Chaldean
               Seminary in Baghdad from 1963. At Babel College, which was founded in 1991, he taught
               spirituality, general and oriental, ontology and philosophy of nature. In 1997 he
               began teaching Syriac theology as well.</p>
                    <p>Initially in Paris under the influence of L. Massignon, his teacher, he studied
               Islamic mysticism, but the Carmelite order preferred that he focus on the mystical
               writings of the Syriac church. He studied Near Eastern languages for three years,
               graduated from the École Pratique des Hautes Études in 1971, and presented his
               doctoral thesis at the Sorbonne in 1974. Both parts of his thesis were published: <hi rend="italic">La lumière sans forme</hi> in 1987 and <hi rend="italic">L’enseignement spirituel de Jean de Dalyatha</hi> in 1990. <ref rend="bold">Antoine
                  Guillaumont</ref> was his teacher at the École Pratique and attested to the
               contribution his studies made to scholarship. At that time, <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan
                  of Dalyatha</ref> was largely unedited so that in order to write his thesis Beulay
               had to assemble copies of mss., including the Arabic version — all of this in Baghdad
               far from western libraries. In addition to Yoḥannan of Dalyatha, he did significant
               research on <ref rend="bold">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref> as well, including a translation of
               Yawsep’s ‘Treatise on the nature of the divine essence’, preserved in a 13th-cent.
               ms. from <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref> (Notre-Dame des Semences 237/Dawra 680). His
               commitment to scholarship never waned nor was compromised during his many years in
               Baghdad. He contributed publications and actively participated in seminars and
               international symposia on Syriac studies.</p>
                    <p>He never lost sight of the connection between Syriac writers and their church. Also
               he sought to make this tradition available to the Iraqi people among whose ancestors
               it had developed. He did this while teaching at Babel College. Several articles from
               this period may be found in <hi rend="italic">Patrimoine Syriaque</hi> (1996, 2001,
               2005). Through his teaching and his ministry as priest, he worked to sustain the
               faith of countless students during tragic years in Iraq. Even after he returned
               permanently to France in 2004, for health reasons, his students exiled all over the
               world kept in touch. He died in 2007 in Normandy and was buried in Lisieux.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Ever since the 2nd cent., when the first Syriac Bible translations were produced, the
               Bible has played an important role in Syriac Christianity. It is not just that many
               terms specific to the spirituality of the Syriac Churches have their origin in these
               versions, they have also contributed to the spread of the dialect of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> as a standard language for a large group of Christians. For today’s
               Syriac churches, they remain important, either in the original tongue or in
               translations into English or Malayalam. They have, however, also attracted the
               interest of scholars outside the Syriac communities. This has to do with the fact
               that the Syriac versions are very ancient and have also come down to us in relatively
               ancient mss. (see <ref rend="bold">Bible, OT manuscripts</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Bible, NT manuscripts</ref>). They give us a picture of the original Hebrew and
               Greek texts at the moment the translations into Syriac were made.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Syriac Translations of the Old Testament</label>
                    <p>The first Syriac version of the OT must have been made in the second half of the 2nd
               cent. At least since the 9th cent., it has been known under the name <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>. In contrast to other early Christian translations of the OT, it
               was based on the Hebrew Bible rather than the Greek Septuagint. This fact gives it a
               special place among the witnesses to the Hebrew Bible, the pronunciation of which was
               codified only from the 7th cent. onwards.</p>
                    <p>When Greek OT commentaries started to be translated into Syriac in the 4th and 5th
               cent., their translators used the Peshitta for the biblical quotations. Soon they
               found out that this text did not always agree with the Greek text of the
               commentaries, which sometimes made it hard to understand what the exegete in question
               was referring to. For this reason, E.-Syr. translators started to add <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> translations of the biblical text as quoted in the Greek
               commentary to the verse taken from the Peshitta. They would mark these <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> renderings specifically as ‘the Greek’. At least since
                  <ref rend="bold">Mushe of Aggel</ref> early in the 6th cent., W.-Syr. translators
               started simply to render the biblical text of the commentary, no longer referring to
               the Peshitta. Such <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> renderings have often been mistaken
               for quotations from a version made by the chorepiscopus <ref rend="bold">Polykarpos</ref> in 507/508, which may have extended to the OT: there is evidence
               at least for Genesis, Exodus, and Isaiah (the so-called Syro-Lucianic fragments
               edited by Ceriani may belong to it). This version is indicative of the high status
               accorded to the Greek language and Greek Bible by the person who commissioned it,
                  <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>. Philoxenos was afraid that loose
               renderings might give rise to Dyophysite interpretations.</p>
                    <p>A century later, in 613–17, the status of Greek among the W. Syr. was such that <ref rend="bold">Pawlos of Tella</ref> felt the need to make an extremely literal ‘mirror
               translation’ of the Septuagint, known as the <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref>. Here
               the unit of translation is the single word or even part of it. The name refers to
               Origen’s Hexapla, as it claims to be based on a version of the fifth, Septuagint,
               column supplied with text-critical signs indicating where material has been added or
               omitted, as well as notes referring to the three revisions: Aquila, Symmachus, and
               Theodotion.</p>
                    <p>At a time when the Greek language was losing its status, <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of
                  Edessa</ref> produced his revision of the Peshitta with the help of one or more
               Greek mss.; there is no evidence that he used the Syro-Hexapla, as has been assumed
               by some. It may be seen as a last effort to make the Greek Bible acceptable to Syriac
               readers. Yaʿqub’s version was a compromise between the two positions defended in
               Syriac Christianity: the position of Philoxenos, who would have liked to replace the
               Peshitta with a very literal rendering of the Septuagint, and that of <ref rend="bold">Eusebius of Emesa</ref>, who thought that the Peshitta was reliable because the
               Syriac language was related to the Hebrew. In addition, Yaʿqub wanted to clarify the
               text to his readers.</p>
                    <p>Syriac exegetes of the OT (see <ref rend="bold">Exegesis, Old Testament</ref>) were
               well aware of the existence of alternative readings. In his ‘Commentary on Genesis’
                  <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> already quotes two different renderings, without
               mentioning the source (ad Gen. 49:10 and 49:23). These alternative readings happen to
               agree with Targum Onqelos. In the 5th cent., translations of Antiochene commentaries
               of such authors as Eusebius of Emesa, <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>,
               and <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref> showed to Syriac exegetes the practice of
               quoting ‘the Hebrew’ as well as the revisions of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion.
               Eusebius and Theodore were read by the E. Syr.; John Chrysostom was studied by W.
               Syr. as well. The latter of course also became familiar with this practice through
               the notes in the margins of the Syro-Hexapla.</p>
                    <p>Even though the E. Syr. adopted Theodore of Mopsuestia, who was rather negative about
               the authority of the Peshitta, as their exegete <hi rend="italic">par
               excellence</hi>, and even though the W.-Syr. tradition was influenced by the opinion
               of Philoxenos that favored the Greek text, the Peshitta remained the standard version
               for all: ‘it is in the hands of the Syrians everywhere’ as <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref> had to conclude in the introduction to his scholia on the Bible, the
                  <hi rend="italic">Awṣar roze</hi>. Only occasionally passages from the
               Syro-Hexapla found their way into W.-Syr. lectionary mss. used in the liturgy.</p>
                    <p>Problems of orthography and pronunciation in the Syriac language were dealt with in
               the mss. of the ‘<ref rend="bold">Masora</ref>’, which flourished in the two centuries
               after Yaʿqub of Edessa. The W.-Syr. ‘Masora’, which is associated with the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Qarqaphto</ref>, gives samples from the OT and NT (Peshitta
               and <ref rend="bold">Ḥarqlean</ref>), as well as patristic sources, in order to
               illustrate the correct use of the language in writing and reading; the E.-Syr.
               ‘Masora’ is exclusively biblical.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Syriac Translations of the New Testament</label>
                    <p>The Syriac versions of the NT are all based on Greek texts. Though they are the
               oldest translations in a Semitic language, there is no reason to assume any direct
               connection between these Syriac (i.e. Eastern Aramaic) texts and Jesus’ original
               words in Western Aramaic. Some unusual forms of vocabulary and grammar found in the
               so-called Old Syriactranslation can easily be explained as archaic forms of the
               Syriac language. They should not necessarily be seen as Western, Palestinian Aramaic
               forms. For biblical scholars, the importance of the Syriac versions lies primarily in
               the fact that they are essential witnesses to the text history of the Greek NT, as
               they contain demonstrably archaic variants. Many of these must have originated in
               Greek mss. that are no longer available to us, but even where this is not the case,
               they may still give us insight into the theology and mindset of early Christians.</p>
                    <p>The oldest Syriac version of the Gospels is the <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref>
               (also <hi rend="italic">ewangeliyon da-mḥallṭe</hi> ‘Gospel of the mixed’), written
               in the early 170s. This version, probably produced by <ref rend="bold">Tatian</ref> and
               probably in Syriac rather than Greek, was quoted by such authors as <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref> and Ephrem; the latter even composed a commentary on it. It
               remained in liturgical use until at least the early 5th cent., when it lost its
               canonical status and was replaced by the four separate Gospels (<hi rend="italic">ewangeliyon da-mparrše</hi> ‘Gospel of the separated’). Although it was
               suppressed by force to such an extent that we are left only with quotations, there
               are reasons to believe that it influenced all later versions. Quotations in Ephrem
               indicate that the Acts and Epistles had also been translated by the 4th cent. It has
               been tentatively suggested that these translations, or forerunners of them, might
               also go back to Tatian’s efforts (Petersen).</p>
                    <p>The Vetus Syra or <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac Version</ref> is the oldest version of
               the four separate Gospels. The two surviving mss., the Curetonianus and the
               Sinaiticus, both date back to the 5th cent., but they may be seen as two
               representatives of a translation probably made in the middle of the 3rd cent. The NT
               Peshitta is the result of a thorough revision of Old Syriac material, using slightly
               different Greek mss. The differences between the Old Syriac and the Peshitta can be
               explained on the basis of the different Greek texts used and the development in the
               ideas on translation technique: the Peshitta is more literal. In the time of <ref rend="bold">Rabbula</ref> this version quickly gained currency as the standard
               version of the Syriac NT, replacing the Diatessaron and other early translations. The
               NT Peshitta also covers the Acts and Epistles, apart from 2 Peter, 2–3 John, and
               Jude; it also omitted Revelation.</p>
                    <p>As stated above, for theological reasons Philoxenos of Mabbug preferred a more
               precise rendering of the Greek, which Polykarpos made for him in 507/8. This
               Philoxenian Version was a revision of the Peshitta. There has been considerable
               confusion between this version and the Ḥarqlean <ref rend="bold">Version, made in
                  615/16 by Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref>. On the basis of Philoxenos’s Gospel commentaries,
               Brock has demonstrated that the Philoxenian is lost, apart from Philoxenos’s own
               quotations and perhaps a 6th-cent. translation of the Minor Catholic Epistles and
               Revelation. The Ḥarqlean, which covers all 27 NT books, shares many characteristics
               with the Syro-Hexapla, which was made in the same place, the <ref rend="bold">Enaton</ref> outside Alexandria, and at the same time: it is a revision of the
               Philoxenian with the aim of producing a mirror translation of the Greek. Tuma strove
               to achieve a formal equivalence between Greek and Syriac which extended sometimes
               even below word level.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The Syriac Canon</label>
                    <p>Syriac biblical mss. usually contain no more than one book or a small group of books,
               for instance the Pentateuch, the ‘Book of the Women’ (Ruth, Susanna, Esther, and
               Judith), or the <hi rend="italic">Beth Mawtbe</hi> ‘the Book of Sessions’ (Joshua,
               Judges, Samuel, Kings, Proverbs, Qohelet, Ruth, Song of Songs, Bar Sira, and Job;
               especially in the E.-Syr. tradition). Differences between the very few early <hi rend="italic">pandects</hi> containing the whole OT show that neither the Syriac
               canon of the OT nor the order of books had been defined in the first millenium.
               Though there are reasons to believe that Chronicles, Ezra-Nehemiah, Esther, Job, and
               Song of Songs did not form part of the canon in earlier centuries (Haelewyck), the
               books of the Hebrew Bible are all present in these <hi rend="italic">pandects</hi>.
               The situation with regard to the so-called Apocrypha or Deuterocanonical works, on
               the other hand, still differs from <hi rend="italic">pandect</hi> to <hi rend="italic">pandect</hi>. The Milan ms. (7a1) even contains part of Flavius <ref rend="bold">Josephus</ref>’s ‘Jewish War’. The order of books is often
               chronological, in which Job, identified with Jobab of Gen. 10:29, is placed directly
               after the Pentateuch.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the NT, the <ref rend="bold">Teaching of Addai</ref> states that members
               of the church are to read the Gospel, the Epistles of Paul, and the Book of Acts.
               During the first centuries, ‘the Gospel’ referred to the Diatessaron. As stated
               above, Ephrem already knew the four separate Gospels in the Old Syriac Version; he
               referred to them as ‘the Greek’. Only in the time of Rabbula the Peshitta with its
               four-Gospel canon replaced the Diatessaron. It contained a total of 22 books, as it
               did not include 2 Peter, 2–3 John, Jude, and Revelation (cf. also <ref rend="bold">Apocalypses</ref>). This canon, also known from Antiochene authors, no longer
               included the additional (3rd) epistle to the Corinthians which is quoted in Ephrem’s
               Commentary on the Pauline Epistles (Armenian). It may also have ‘promoted’ 1 Peter
               and 1 John, which were known to Ephrem but probably not considered canonical by him.
               2 Peter, 2–3 John, Jude, and Revelation were translated for the first time in the 6th
               cent. (possibly as part of the version made by Polykarpos for Philoxenos) and are
               also present in the Ḥarqlean Version.</p>

               Leiden Peshitta edition; 459/60), and a Pentateuch (5b1; 463/4). Of the ca. 50 <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> mss. dating from before ca. 1000 (eleven of which are
               dated), two-thirds consist of single books, the remainder being groups of books
               (especially, the Pentateuch), with the exception of three entire Old Testaments (7a1,
               8a1, and 9a1). Occasionally a biblical book is transmitted in the same ms. as
               non-biblical texts. Outside the Pentateuch there is no fixed order of books, even in
               the rare mss. with the entire OT; there the contents as well vary, especially as far
               as the so-called ‘deutero-canonical’ or ‘apocryphal’ books are concerned. In the
               E.-Syr. tradition a grouping of books known as <hi rend="italic">Beth Mawtbe</hi>
               came into use, consisting of the historical books, less Chronicles, followed by
               Proverbs, Sirach, Qohelet, Ruth, Song, and Job (Psalms were usually copied

               of the liturgical year. Illustrations are extremely rare; with the exception of a
               portrait of David in a Sinai ms. of Kings (7h10) these are confined to two <hi rend="italic">de luxe</hi> productions with the entire OT (8a1, 12a1). Bilingual
               mss. are also very rare and almost all are Syriac with Arabic; an exceptional case is
               a pentaglot Psalter, Syriac with Arabic, Armenian, Coptic, and Ethiopic (Rome,
               Barberiniani Or. 2; 14th cent.).</p>
                    <p>Of the versions other than the Peshitta, the most important ms. is the large <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref> in Milan, containing the prophetic and wisdom books
               (8th cent.). The first half of this ms., still extant in the 16th cent., has been
               subsequently lost, with the result that for several books no Syro-Hexapla ms. is
               available; Exodus, however, is preserved in a ms. dated 697. Occasionally the
               Syro-Hexapla features in a separate column alongside other versions: with Peshitta
               (Isaiah; 9k3); with Greek and Arabic (Psalms; ed. N. Pigulevskaya, <hi rend="italic">Palestinskii Sbornik</hi> 1[63] [1954], 59–90); and in a polyglot Psalter (with
               Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic). Passages from the Syro-Hexapla were sometimes used in
               lectionary mss. Some books of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>’s revision
               survive in mss. copied only a decade or two after his death. That of Samuel has
               lections supplied (with a table indicating where to find them) in an early second
               hand.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Most of the important biblical mss. extant today derive from three ancient
               collections in the Near East: From <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān,</ref>from the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref> at Mount Sinai, and from <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> near <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>. A small part of the
               Nitrian collection (from Dayr al-Suryān) was acquired by the Biblioteca Apostolica
               Vaticana in the 18th cent., its larger part came to the British Museum (Library)
               during the 19th cent. The Sinaitic collection remained unmoved from the 6th cent.
               (the time of Emperor Justinian) until today, the mss. of Dayr al-Zaʿfarān moved to
               Mardin, <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>.</p>
                    <p>1. No Syriac copy of the <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref> survived; <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>’s commentary is the only Syriac witness extant today (ms. Dublin,
               Chester Beatty Library 709; 5th/6th  cent., from Dayr al-Suryān).</p>
                    <p>2. Of the <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac Version</ref> only two defective Gospel mss.
               survived: The 5th-cent. ‘Codex Curetonianus’ of the Nitrian coll. (now ms. London,
               Brit. Libr. Add. 14,451), edited for the first time by <ref rend="bold">W.
                  Cureton</ref> (1858) and again by <ref rend="bold">F. C. Burkitt</ref> (1904); and
               the 4th/5th-cent. ‘Sinaitic Ms.’ (ms. Sinai Syr. 30; Hatch, <hi rend="italic">Album</hi> plate xlvi), a palimpsest which is not entirely deciphered, discovered
               in 1892 by Agnes Smith Lewis and published by her in 1894/96 and 1910.</p>
                    <p>3. Most of the Syriac NT mss. in the large collections are <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> mss. Among the ca. 100 of the British Library, ca. 60 are from the
               first millennium, and ca. 30 of them are 5th/7th-cent. mss. Thanks to the Nitrian
               collection of the British Library, we have a good knowledge of the early Peshitta,
               which originates from the beginning of the 5th cent. Though many mss. have lost their
               colophon, a considerable part of them can be assigned to the 5th/6th cent. on
               palaeographical grounds.</p>
                    <p>Early Peshitta mss. of the whole NT (according to the Peshitta canon) are ms. London,
               Brit. Libr. Add. 14,470 (5th/6th, Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue … British
                  Museum</hi>, vol. 1, no. lxiii), Brit. Libr. Add. 14,448 (700/01, no. lxiv), ms.
               Sinai Syr. 17 (9th) and 54 (8th), ms. Damascus, Syr. Orth. Patr. Libr. 12/1
               (7th/8th?), and ms. Mingana Syr. 103 (‘about AD 790’, according to Mingana, but
               rather 8th/9th cent.).</p>
                    <p>The oldest dated Gospel mss. are from the 6th cent.: ms. Dayr al-Suryān 10 (510); ms.
               London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,459 fol. 67–169 (between 528/538, colophon damaged; no.
               ci; Hatch, <hi rend="italic">Album,</hi> plate xiii); ms. Vat. Syr. 12 (548, plate
               xx); ms. Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana Plut. I,56 (586, plate xxxiv). Undated, but of
               the 5th/ 6th cent. are ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 296 fol. 1–38, Sinai Syr. 2, and
               nos. lxvi, lxvii, lxxiii, xc–xciv, xcvi, xcix, cx, cxiii in Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue … British Museum</hi>, vol. 1. Of special interest is Cod. Phillipps
               1388 (5th/6th, Berlin). This Gospel codex is singled out by its archaic
               orthographical features; though doubtless a Peshitta codex, it preserved a
               considerable Old Syriac textual heritage.</p>
                    <p>The earliest Peshitta mss. of Acts and the Catholic Epistles are ms. London, Brit.
               Libr. Add. 14,473 (no. cxxv), Add. 17,120 (no. cxxvi), Add. 17,121 (no. cxxvii), Add.
               14,472 (no. cxxviii, datable before 624), Add. 18,812 (no. cxxix), all of the 6th/7th
               cent.</p>
                    <p>The oldest Peshitta mss. of the Pauline Letters are ms. 3 of the Public Library in
               St. Petersburg (5th/6th), ms. Sinai Syr. 3 and 5 (both 5th/6th), Cod. Syr. 8 of the
               Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich (6th/7th), and ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add.
               14,476 (no. cxxxiii), Add. 14,480 (no. cxxxiv), both from the 5th/6th cent.; Add.
               14,479 (dated 533/34, no. cxxxv), Add. 14,475 (no. cxxxvi), Add. 17,122 (no. cxxxvii)
               from the 6th cent.; Add. 14,477 (no. cxxxviii) and 14,481 (no. cxxxix) from the 7th
               cent.</p>
                    <p>4. No early copy of the Philoxenian version (507/08) survived. Remnants (partly in
               Maronite tradition) ascribed to this version preserve the extra-Peshitta texts (2
               Pet., 2–3 John, Jude, and Rev.) and were published by J. Gwynn 1897 (Rev., based on
               ms. Crawford Syr. 2, 12th/13th, now John Rylands Library, Manchester) and 1909. Among
               Gwynn’s 20 mss. the oldest dated (823) is ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,623
               (Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue … British Museum</hi>, vol. 2, no. dcclxxxi;
               Hatch, <hi rend="italic">Album,</hi> plate xcviii). Today at least ten more are
               availiable, all of the second millennium: ms. Damascus Patr. 1/2; ms. Mingana Syr.
               480; ms. Bibl. Ambrosiana B20.2 inf. (Milan); ms. Vat. Syr. 461; 475, 486, ms. Paris,
               Bibl. Nat. Syr. 429, ms. Berlin, Diez A. quart. 105, ms. Mardin Orth. 36/2.</p>
                    <p>5a. The mss. of the <ref rend="bold">Ḥarqlean version</ref> (615/16) usually catch the
               eye by the numerous Greek and Syriac words quoted in the margins and by the critical
               signs (<hi rend="italic">asterisks</hi> and <hi rend="italic">obeloi</hi>) inserted
               into the text. But this typical feature of the Ḥarqlean version was already reduced
               by revisional development during the first millennium, and then completely omitted in
               mss. mainly of the second millennium. Nevertheless, the oldest dated Ḥarqlean ms.
               (Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana Plut. I,40, dated to 756) already omits all marginal
               annotations (although there are Greek notes), and one of the latest (ms. Oxford, New
               College 333, 12th/13th cent., the whole NT, breaking off Heb 11,27) belongs to those
               with the fullest margin. The <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> (1778–1803) of J.
               White is based on this late ms., which in fact accumulates the marginalia of two
               different stages of development. The dominance of White’s Gospel text was recently
               balanced by ms. Vat. Syr. 268, published by G. A. Kiraz in 1996 (as the Ḥarqlean line
               in Kiraz, <hi rend="italic">CESG</hi>). This ms. from the Nitrian coll. in the
               British Library represents the most original text and margin of the Ḥarqlean Gospels
               by its unrevised non- and pre-Byzantine readings. Though the date ‘1170 A. Gr.’
               (858/59) on the almost illegible fol. 172v is not the original date of the ms. as
               Hatch, <hi rend="italic">Album,</hi> plate lxix declares (for details see Kiraz, <hi rend="italic">CESG</hi>, vol. 1, xlvi– xlvii), it is assigned to the 8th/9th cent.
               on palaeographical grounds. Important Gospel mss. with marginal notes of the first
               revisional stage are ms. Vat. Syr. 267 (8th), ms. Harvard Syr. 16 (8th/9th), ms.
               London, Brit. Libr. Add. 7163, and ms. Mingana Syr. 124 (both 9th/10th), ms. Syr.
               Orth. Patr. Libr. 12/8 (1055, from Dayr al-Zaʿfarān), ms. Syr. Orth. Patr. Libr. 12/9
               (998/999; formerly ms. Jerusalem, St. Mark 25, Hatch, <hi rend="italic">Album,</hi>
               plate lxxvi), ms. Chester Beatty Syr. 3 (1177, copied from a model of 841; Hatch, <hi rend="italic">Album,</hi> plate lxxxiii). Mss. of the first millennium without
               marginal notes are ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,469 (935/36), and ms. Cambridge,
               Univ. Library or. 227 (1061/62, with <hi rend="italic">asterisks</hi> and <hi rend="italic">obeloi</hi>).</p>
                    <p>5b. The second revisional stage (traceable in the Gospels only) is ascribed to <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> according to a subscription in ms. Oxford,
               New Coll. 334 (12th/13th) and ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,124 (1233/34), both
               with marginal notes (Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue  … British Museum</hi>, vol.
               1, 42). Connected with this unhomogeneous stage are some 15 late mss. of which ms.
               Baghdad, Chaldean Monastery no. 25 (12th/13th; Vosté no. 16), ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat.
               Syr. 53 (12th), and ms. Oxford, New Coll. 333 (12th/13th) are furnished with marginal
               and asterisked annotations.</p>
                    <p>5c. Only two mss. of Acts (of unkown revisional stage) are availiable today: ms.
               Oxford, New Coll. 333 (12th/13th) and ms. Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Add. 1700 (1169/70,
               Hatch, <hi rend="italic">Album</hi> plate cxxix). Both mss. provide all books of the
               NT (without Rev.), only the first offers the Ḥarqlean marginal annotations. Besides
               these two mss. ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,474 (9th) includes the Catholic
               Epistles (with annotations; 1 Pet. Peshitta). The Cambridge ms. also includes the two
               letters to the Corinthians ascribed to <ref rend="bold">Clement of Rome</ref>. Ms.
               Jerusalem, St. Mark 37 (9th, with annotations) is the only early witness for St.
               Paul’s Letters. Revelation is represented by ca. ten late mss., ms. Mardin Orth. 36/2
               (13th; ed. by A. Vööbus [as 35/2] in CSCO 400 with an informative introduction) is
               furnished with a subscription, and marginal/asterisked readings. The book of Rev. in
               the Ḥarqlean version is still waiting for a critical edition; I. R. Beacham has,
               however, provided a thorough investigation.</p>
                    <p>A special category of biblical mss. are the mss. of the so-called <ref rend="bold">Masora</ref>.</p>
                    <p>6. Dated and datable mss. of the Peshitta (first millennium): Complete NT: ms.
               London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,448 (700/01), Add. 7157 (767/68); ms. Pierpont Morgan
               Library 236 (749/750), ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 342 (894); Gospels: ms. Dayr
               al-Suryān 10 (510); ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,459, fol. 67–169 (between
               528/38), ms. Vat. Syr. 12 (548), ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,464 (before 583),
               ms. Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana Plut. I,56 (586; the <ref rend="bold">Rabbula
                  Gospels</ref>), ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,460 (599/600), Add. 14,471
               (614/15); Acts/Cath. Epistles: ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,472 (before 624);
               Pauline Epistles: ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,478 (ante 621/22), Add. 14,479
               (533/34).</p>
                    <p>For two reasons Peshitta mss. offer good conditions for qualified dating. Firstly,
               the number of dated and datable mss. is considerable. There are at least 10 such mss.
               of the 5th–8th cent.; their palaeographical features and codicological data offer
               help for an approximate dating of undated codices. Secondly, the large number of
               Peshitta mss. allows for tracing the development of variant readings. Considering the
               place of the dated mss. within this development, it is mainly possible to assign an
               approximate date to undated mss. by knowledge of their variants; e.g. misdated mss.
               corrected this way are ms. Sinai Syr. 3 (5th/6th, not 7th cent.), ms. Vat. Syr. 266
               (10th/11th cent., not 7th); ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,478 (5th/6th cent., not
               621/22, which is the date of the owner’s note).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>The earliest attempts at collecting and systematizing knowledge about Syriac
               Christian authors and their writings can be traced back to the Syrians themselves.
               One might refer to the ‘Catalogue of Books’ by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha
               </ref>(d. 1318), a poem listing all Syriac authors known to him and their writings.
               An annotated edition of the ‘Catalogue’ was an important component in <ref rend="bold">J. S. Assemani</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Orientalis</hi> (1719–28),
               which marks the transition between pre-modern and modern scholarship. Ample
               references to 19th- and early 20th-cent. publications on Syriac authors can be found
               in <ref rend="bold">A. Baumstark</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der syrischen
                  Literatur</hi> (1921), while the first six decades of the 20th cent. are covered
               in I. Ortiz de Urbina’s <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Syriaca</hi> (2nd ed. 1965).
               Both of these works provide a narrative, albeit fragmented, history of Syriac
               literature and are not primarily designed as bibliographical tools. C. Moss’ <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Syriac books and related literature in the British
                  Museum</hi> (1962), on the other hand, is a pure bibliography. Though limited to
               the holdings of one institution, it provides a very useful key to Syriac scholarship.
               Ancient and modern authors are listed indiscriminately in alphabetical order, and
               some broader topics (e.g., ‘Bible’, ‘Liturgies’) are included as well. This approach
               necessitated a great number of cross-references and, in addition, the user has to go
               back and forth between the main part (col. 2–1174) and the ‘Addenda’ (col. 1–206).
               Where Moss left off (1960), S. P. Brock picked up with a series of installments of
               his ‘Syriac studies: a classified bibliography’, published in <hi rend="italic">Parole de l’Orient</hi>. Organized around the names of ancient authors and
               themes, each installment originally covered a ten year span, but since 1980 the
               bibliography has appeared in five year increments. Four installments, altogether
               covering the years 1960–1990, were integrated into one book form publication (Brock
               1996). Three more installments have since appeared: 1991–95 in <hi rend="italic">ParOr</hi> 23 (1998), 1996–2000 in <hi rend="italic">ParOr</hi> 29 (2004), and
               2001–2005 in <hi rend="italic">ParOr</hi> 33 (2008). Brock also publishes an annual
               list of new books on Syriac topics in the winter issue of <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi>, but in contrast to the <hi rend="italic">ParOr</hi> bibliographies,
               this does not include papers in journals or individual chapters in books. Selective
               bibliographies, aimed at beginning scholars, can be found in Brock’s <hi rend="italic">Introduction to Syriac studies</hi> (most recently 2006) and in M.
               Albert’s ‘Langue et littérature syriaque’ (1993).</p>
                    <p>In addition to the general bibliographies mentioned so far (of either the exhaustive
               or the selective type), there exist a number of specialized bibliographies. Brock’s
               contribution to Muraoka’s Syriac grammar (1997 and 2005) covers grammatical studies.
               In the field of Syriac literature, the absence of a fully updated version of
               Baumstark is compensated to a certain extent by Brock’s <hi rend="italic">Brief
                  Outline of Syriac Literature</hi> (1997), which contains many bibliographical
               references. In addition, there are bibliographies dealing with one author, such as
               the very exhaustive bibliographies on <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> (Den Biesen 2002)
               and <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (Takahashi 2005), or the more limited ones on
                  <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serug</ref> (Alwan 1986), <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of
                  Antioch</ref> (Mathews 2002 and 2003), and <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>
               (Kruisheer 2008). Other bliographies are devoted to the OT <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> (Dirksen 1989 and 1995, since 1999 regularly updated in the <hi rend="italic">Journal for the Aramaic Bible</hi>, and since 2003 in <hi rend="italic">Aramaic Studies</hi>), <ref rend="bold">liturgy</ref> (Sauget 1962 and
               Yousif 1990), Syriac sources on early Islam (Penn 2003 — to be used alongside
               Hoyland, <hi rend="italic">Seeing Islam</hi>, and Thomas and Roggema, <hi rend="italic">Christian-Muslim relations</hi>, vol. 1. <hi rend="italic">600–900</hi> [2009]), <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref> (Brock 1978 and
               Desreumaux 1980), and Neo-Syriac (see <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref>), as part of the
               broader field of Neo-Aramaic (Krotkoff 1990 and Younansardaroud 2003). A bibliography
               of Syriac mystical literature is forthcoming (Pinggéra and Kessel). Fiey’s
               posthumously published <hi rend="italic">Saints syriaques</hi> (2004) provides an
               introduction to Syriac hagiography and present-day hagiographical studies. A very
               useful survey of holdings of Syriac manuscripts world-wide is available in
               Desreumaux’s <hi rend="italic">Répertoire des manuscrits syriaques</hi> (1991).</p>
                    <p>While the focus of scholarly monographs is obviously on the topic they study, they
               often provide very useful windows into segments of contemporary scholarship. Examples
               are R. Macuch’s 1976 book on later Syriac literature (as a sequel to Baumstark) and
               J. F. Coakley’s 2006 study of Syriac typography. Where Syriac is not the primary
               language, such as is the case for a number of apocryphal texts and for Syriac
               translations of Greek patristic works, the existing bibliographical tools by Geerard
               (1974–2003 and 1992) and Haelewyck (1998) are very helpful. Similalrly, the Christian
               Arabic bibliographies by Teule and Schepens (2005 and 2006) contain many items
               relevant to Syriac studies.</p>
                    <p>Along with the main periodicals in the field, collective works organized around one
               specific theme or field often give a convenient overview of the state of the art and
               provide bibliographical references. The successive volumes published in the
               collection ‘Études syriaques’ may be singled out as examples. They deal with
               inscriptions   (no. 1), apocrypha (2), liturgies (3), the Greek Fathers (4), and the
               OT (5). Several contributions to the volume ‘Nos sources’ (Atallah 2005) include
               bibliographical details as well. Bibliographies of individual scholars often are
               found in Festschrifts or memorial volumes, or are part of obituaries; references to
               such bibliographies are included in the section ‘Bibliography’ of Brock’s
               bibliographies.</p>
                    <p>In recent years a number of on-line databases have started to provide access to
               important resources and search tools. The following sites may be singled out:</p>

               1957 was consecrated bp. of ʿAmadiyya where later he witnessed the mass exodus of

                    <p>Terms for a committed community of ascetic individuals, originating in the
               pre-monastic 4th cent. and continuing in various forms to the present.</p>
                    <p>The meaning of the term has long been debated. <hi rend="italic">Qyāmā</hi> is
               derived from the root <hi rend="italic">qwm</hi> with the basic meaning ‘to stand’,
               ‘to rise’, but also has the range of ‘stance’, ‘status’, ‘state’, ‘station (in
               life)’. From this some see the concept of ‘taking a stand’ or ‘covenant’ to have
               developed. A <hi rend="italic">bar/ba(r)t qyāmā</hi> is a ‘son/daughter of the
               covenant’ or ‘covenanter’ (see Nedungatt) — one who has accepted or adopted the
               covenant of the Christian ascetical way of life. The word <hi rend="italic">qyāmā</hi> by itself was frequently used as a synonym not only for the
               consecrated elite, but for the whole Syriac Christian community.</p>
                    <p>Some scholars believe the term suggests <hi rend="italic">bnay qyāmtā</hi> ‘sons of
               the resurrection’ and while this requires shifting the masculine <hi rend="italic">qyāmā</hi>to feminine <hi rend="italic">qyāmtā</hi>, an allusion is possible with
               reference to Luke 20:36, ‘for they have become children of the resurrection’.</p>
                    <p>More recently, some scholars have explored the possible connections between <hi rend="italic">qyāmā</hi>and the Greek term <hi rend="italic">kanōn</hi>(as an
               equivalent of ‘clergy’)and theHebrew term <hi rend="italic">maʿămād</hi> (especially
               in the Jewish institution of the <hi rend="italic">anšē maʿămād</hi>) (see Macina, as well as M. J. Pierre, <hi rend="italic">Aphraate, le Sage persan:
                     Les exposés</hi> [SC 249; 1988], 99 n. 84).
                    </p>
                    <p>The principle source for the early history of the <hi rend="italic">bnay/bnāt
                  qyāmā</hi> is <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref>’s Sixth Demonstration, ‘On the <hi rend="italic">Bnay Qyāmā</hi>’, particularly in the section dubbed ‘Aphrahaṭ’s
               Rule’ (<hi rend="italic">Dem</hi>. 6.8). Celibacy is no longer a requirement for
               inclusion, nor is absolute poverty required as almsgiving is encouraged. Fervent
               faith, evidenced in zealous fasting and prayer, is the foundation. Much attention is
               directed to sincere and careful speech, avoiding gossip and envious feelings, as well
               as treating enemies and evil ones without enmity.</p>
                    <p>The goal is the imitation of Christ, whereby Aphrahaṭ used the term <ref rend="bold">iḥidāyā</ref> ‘solitary, single’, as a synonym for <hi rend="italic">bar/ba(r)t
                  qyāmā</hi>, <hi rend="italic">iḥidāyā</hi> being also the term for Christ, ‘the
               Only-Begotten One’ (Greek <hi rend="italic">monogenēs</hi>). The <hi rend="italic">bnay/bnāt qyāmā</hi> were solitaries who followed the way of the <hi rend="italic">Iḥidāyā</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Aphrahaṭ cautions against excessive behavior, fancy clothes and hair, and going to
               intemperate feasts. His greatest concern is the practice of ‘spiritual marriage’
               among males and females of the <hi rend="italic">qyāmā</hi> who live together for the
               purposes of helping one another in the maintenance of a household.</p>
                    <p>The activity of the <hi rend="italic">bnay/bnāt qyāmā</hi> is referred to in a number
               of later documents and contexts. <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> reputedly organized and
               conducted a choir of <hi rend="italic">bnāt qyāmā</hi> who sang most of his hymns.
               The 15th canon of the Synod of Laodicea of Phrygia (between 343–81) prohibits anyone
               to sing in the church except <hi rend="italic">bnāt qyāmā</hi> and other chanters.
               Nearly half of the canons of <ref rend="bold">Rabbula</ref>, bp. of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (411–32) deal with the <hi rend="italic">bnay/bnāt qyāmā</hi>,
               proscribing excessive behavior and indicating a wide-spread presence and involvement
               in the administration and active ministries of local churches, towns, and
               villages.</p>
                    <p>During the 4th and 5th cent. the <hi rend="italic">bnay/bnāt qyāmā</hi> were
               novitiates living in the world, preparing for the priesthood or monastic vocation.
               Many used the institution as a youthful rite of passage and training experience
               rounding them out for a secular career upon attaining maturity. In general,
               communities of the <hi rend="italic">bnāt qyāmā</hi> appear to have maintained a more
               vital existence than those of their male counterparts.</p>
                    <p>Later references to the institution are found in <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of
                  Ephesus</ref> (d. 586), whose life of Simeon the Mountaineer (<hi rend="italic">Lives of the Eastern Saints</hi>, 16) depicts an ascetic who settles in a
               village, reestablishing there the church and <hi rend="italic">bnay qyāmā</hi>,
               though not without resistance; in <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref> (7th cent.);
               in canons of the 7th and 12th cent.; and in <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (d.
               1286). Gradually, the <hi rend="italic">bnay/bnāt qyāmā</hi> lost their status as the
               ascetical elite to monks and solitaries who live apart from the town and village.
               Monasticism proper assumed their roles, though Bar ʿEbroyo points to a brief revival
               of <hi rend="italic">bnay/bnāt qyāmā</hi> in the 13th cent. The term <hi rend="italic">ba(r)t qyāmā</hi> survives in W. Syr. as <hi rend="italic">bath
                  qyomo</hi> to denote a priest’s wife until this day.</p>

                    <p>Proposed dates range from mid-4th cent to ca. 430. Collection of thirty Syriac
               discourses (<hi rend="italic">memre</hi>) preceded by an introductory essay (<hi rend="italic">mamllā</hi>) on the spiritual life and the pursuit of perfection.
               The anonymous author gives very few historical or geographical details in the <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, but one reference points to a location of the author and
               his spiritual community in northeast Iraq near the Lesser Zab River.</p>
                    <p>The collection does not have a Syriac title. Its Latin title (<hi rend="italic">Liber
                  Graduum)</hi> was given by Michael Kmosko in his 1926 critical edition of the
               Syriac text (with Latin translation), referring to the ascetical steps (<hi rend="italic">massqātā</hi>) one must climb along the steep road to the heavenly
               city of Christ. This term is mentioned only in two <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>,
               numbers 19 and 20. Kmosko utilized fifteen mss., only three containing more than five
                  <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Kmosko theorized that the the book was a primary text of the Messalian movement in
               the mid-to-late- 4th cent. This view was accepted by I. Hausherr and dominated
               scholarship for the next thirty years. In the 1950’s A. Vööbus challenged the
               Messalian characterization of the book and directed scholars towards its witness to
               early Syriac asceticism and spirituality. Others focused on the pneumatology (A.
               Guillaumont), ecclesiology (R. Murray), anthropology and prayer (A. Kowalski),
               structure (L. Wickham), and christology and asceticism (D. Juhl).</p>
                    <p>The thirty <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> are of uneven length and utilize a variety of
               genres: extended biblical exegeses, sermons, discourses on ascetical method. The
               dominant theme threading throughout the collection is the description of the two
               statuses of Christian life: uprightness (<hi rend="italic">kenutā</hi>) and
               perfection or maturity (<hi rend="italic">gmirutā</hi>) and those individuals who
               attempt to embody these ways of life — the Upright (<hi rend="italic">kene</hi>) and
               the Perfect (<hi rend="italic">gmire</hi>).</p>
                    <p>Writing in the midst of a pre-monastic religious community, the author of the ‘Book
               of Steps’ attempted to counter a decline in the standards and fervor among the
               Perfect. The first half of the collection presents a rule for both levels as the
               ideal to which they aspire. The second half contains a variety of materials, with the
               last six <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> advocating the legitimacy of the Upright.</p>
                    <p>The titles of the <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> are: Preface by the editor of the
               collection; 1. Author’s introduction; 2. About those who want to become Perfect; 3.
               The physical and spiritual ministry; 4. On the vegetables for the sick; 5. On the

               author on the ways of the Upright; 14. On the Upright and the Perfect; 15. On Adam’s

               tears of prayer; 19. On the discernment of the way of Perfection; 20. On the

               love of the solitaries.</p>

                    <p>City in the Ḥawrān, present-day southern Syria, ca. 120 km. south of <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>. Bostra is the Graeco-Latin name, corresponding to Buṣra or Boṣra
               in Syriac, Jewish Aramaic, Rabbinic Hebrew, and Arabic. Bostra was a Nabataean city
               which, after the Roman conquest of the Nabataean kingdom by Emperor Trajan, in 106,
               became the capital of the Roman province of Arabia.</p>
                    <p>Christianity came to the city no later than the beginning of the 3rd cent. Origen
               visited Bostra in 214–15 and met with the local bp. Beryllus. Bostra was ethnically,
               linguistically, and religiously diverse. Along with Christianity, there were local
               pagan cults, Judaism, and, in all likelihood, Manichaeism. One of Bostra’s famous
               bishops, <ref rend="bold">Titus</ref> (d. before 378) is the author of an extensive
               refutation of Manichaeism. This important work, originally written in Greek (in which
               language it only partly survives) exists in its entirety in a Syriac translation that
               is preserved in the earliest dated Syriac ms. of 411 (London, Brit. Libr. Add.
               12,150), written in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>. In 512, bp. Julian of Bostra openly
               opposed <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref>’s consecration as Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>. He subsequently resigned and was replaced by the Miaphysite bp.
               Cassian. For the rest of the 6th and for the 7th cent., names of bishops are known on
               both the Syr. Orth. and the Chalcedonian side, which indicates that the Christians
               were divided. Several churches were built, renovated, or inaugurated in the 6th
               cent.</p>
                    <p>Bostra, which must have had a strong Arab component throughout its history, fell to
               the Arabs in 635. It is in Bostra that, according to tradition, the meeting between
               Muḥammad and the Christian monk <ref rend="bold">Sargis Bḥira</ref> took place. For
               several centuries Bostra retained some of its importance, as it was on the pilgrims’
               road from Damascus to Mecca. Nowadays it is a modest town, dominated by the ruins
               which reflect its earlier and more prosperous Christian and Muslim past.</p>

               ‘Book of the Soul’, a German translation of which he published in 1891. After
               obtaining his doctor’s degree from the University of Munich in 1890, he returned to
               Rome. In 1894 the University of Würzburg created for him a position as
               extra-ordinarius professor in Semitic languages and literature. In 1907 he became
               full professor in Patristics at the same university, from which he retired in
               1929.</p>
                    <p>Much of Braun’s scholarly work focuses on a Syriac ms. (in two volumes) to which
               Guidi drew his attention in Rome and which contains a collection of authoritative
               juridical texts of the Ch. of E., i.e. ms. Museo Borgiano K. VI, 4 and 3 (later
               incorporated into the Vatican Library as Borg. Syr. 82 and 81), a 19th-cent. copy of
               a 13th- or 14th-cent. ms. from <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref> (see <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>). Braun’s work on this ms. led to a number of
               individual studies, e.g. on <ref rend="bold">Papa</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Barṣawma of
                  Nisibis</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Marutha of Maypherqaṭ</ref>, as well as to his
               annotated GT of the Acts of the E.-Syr. councils (<hi rend="italic">Das Buch der
                  Synhados</hi> [1900]). The French scholar <ref rend="bold">J. B. Chabot</ref>
               studied the same texts and published the Syriac along with a French translation in
               his <hi rend="italic">Synodicon Orientale</hi> (1902). Chabot primarily based his
               work on the same Roman mss. as Braun, but was able to obtain a second late 19th-cent.
               copy of the Alqosh ms. Even in the light of Chabot’s more comprehensive edition,
               Braun’s work retains its value, since the two scholars worked independently of one
               other.</p>
                    <p>Another major achievement is Braun’s edition and Latin translation of the letters of
               the E.-Syr. Cath. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref> (1914–15), again primarily based
               on ms. Borg. Syr. 81. Only the first volume (39 letters) appeared; the second volume,
               which would have contained about 20 additional letters, remained unpublished,
               although some of these letters were published separately by Braun or others. Finally,
               Braun’s German translation of select Persian martyr acts (1915), based on <ref rend="bold">P. Bedjan</ref>’s edition should be singled out as another of his works
               that even after nearly a century has not been replaced and continues to be extremely
               useful.</p>

                    <p>A self-styled ‘Western Orthodox’ body in Britain, now part of the Coptic
               patriarchate. The leader of the church, the Metropolitan of Glastonbury, formerly
               derived his episcopal succession from various sources, of which three were ultimately
               Syrian: 1. Julius Ferrette (1828–1904), consecrated by the Syr. Orth. Metr. of <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref> (and later Patr. Peṭros III) in 1866; 2. Joseph René Vilatte,
               consecrated by Mar Julius Alvares, a Syr. Orth. bp. in India, in 1892; and 3. Ulrich
               Vernon Herford, consecrated by Mar Basilius (Luis Mariane Soares) a bp. of the Ch. of
                  E.<ref rend="bold"/>in India in 1902. All these consecrations were irregular and in
               later years neither of the churches concerned would recognize them. Since 1994, when
               the metropolitan was admitted to the Coptic synod, the church no longer emphasizes
               its Syrian-church connections. The Church’s magazine is the <hi rend="italic">Glastonbury Review</hi> (see esp. no. 80 [July 1991], 18–28).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>German Semitist. Brockelmann began the study of oriental languages as well as
               classical languages and history, first in Rostock and later in Breslau and
               Strasbourg. After earning his Ph.D. in Strasbourg in 1890 with a dissertation in
               Arabic studies, he became an assistant teacher at a gymnasium in the same city
               (1890–92). He earned his habilitation (an advanced university degree) at the
               University of Breslau in 1893 and became a privatdozent (lecturer) at the same
               institution (1893–1900). In 1895–96, he traveled to London and Constantinople to copy
               Arabic mss. which he intended to publish. He was appointed instructor of Arabic at
               the Seminar for Oriental Languages in Berlin (1900) and later professor at the
               universities of Breslau (1900–03), Königsberg (1903–10), Halle an der Saale (1910–22;
               Rector of the University in 1918/19), and Berlin (1922–23). In 1923 he returned to
               Breslau, where he was Rector of the University in 1932/33 and from where he retired
               in 1935. He returned to Halle in 1937 and continued his scholarly work with much
               intensity. After World War II, he accepted a position as librarian in Halle due to
               financial problems. In 1947, he was appointed professor of Turkish studies at Halle,
               a position that he held until his retirement in 1953.</p>
                    <p>While a gymnasium student, Brockelmann already began to occupy himself with Hebrew,
               Biblical Aramaic, and Syriac. His first publications, however, were devoted to
               Arabic. At an early date he started collecting data for his first significant
               publication, his <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Syriacum</hi>, which appeared in 1895 and
               was distinguished from other lexica of Syriac due to its textual references,
               etymological data, and Latin-Syriac index. A considerably expanded second edition
               appeared between 1923 and 1928. The first two volumes of Brockelmann’s foundational
               and monumental <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der arabischen Literatur</hi> (History of
               Arabic literature) appeared in 1898 and 1902, respectively. They covered all of
               Islamic Arabic literature (and so excluded the confessional literature of Jews and
               Christians in Arabic). Three substantial supplementary volumes appeared between 1937
               and 1942, followed in 1943 and 1949 by the second edition of the first two volumes,
               to which references to the supplementary volumes were added. This masterly handbook
               remains indispensable up to the present day.</p>
                    <p>The year 1899 saw the first publication of Brockelmann’s <hi rend="italic">Syrische
                  Grammatik</hi> (Syriac grammar). It included a chrestomathy and was enhanced by
               substantial historical linguistic explanations. It is often reprinted. Likewise, his
                  <hi rend="italic">Arabische Grammatik</hi> (Arabic grammar), based on a work by
               Albert Socin, was often reprinted. Brockelmann not only provided the impetus for the
               publication of the <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der christlichen Literaturen des
                  Orients</hi> (History of the Christian literatures of the East) in 1907, but also
               contributed to it a survey of Syriac literature (p. 1–66) and brief summaries of
               Christian Palestinian Aramaic (p. 66) and Christian Arabic literature (p. 67–74). In
               1903 and 1908, Brockelmann published descriptions of oriental mss. (including Syriac
               mss.) in Breslau and Hamburg.</p>
                    <p>Brockelmann’s second major work, his two-volume <hi rend="italic">Grundriss der
                  vergleichenden Grammatik der semitischen Sprachen</hi> (Outline of the comparative
               grammar of the Semitic languages) originated during his time in Königsberg and Halle
               (1908 and 1913). In its 1400 pages, Brockelmann discussed all of the Semitic
               languages known in his day. This work has also not yet been replaced. In 1939, he
               published his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der islamischen Völker and Staaten</hi>
               (History of the Islamic peoples and nations), which was translated into many
               languages. To the ‘Semitics’ volume of the <hi rend="italic">Handbook of Oriental
                  Studies</hi>, Brockelmann contributed, among other things, the section on
               Syriac.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the Semitic languages, Brockelmann also occupied himself with the
               research and teaching of Turkish, Armenian, Georgian, and Coptic. His unpublished
               scholarly writings are kept in the Library of the Deutsche Morgenländische
               Gesellschaft in Halle an der Saale.</p>
                    <p>Brockelmann’s work is characterized by an admirable versatility. He exhibited a
               combination of ‘an excellent memory, a distinct sense of order, a quick
               understanding, and the ability to correctly assess the scope of a project, along with
               an unbending will and an exceptional manpower’ (J. Fück).</p>
                    <p>Brockelmann’s main publications are <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Syriacum</hi> (1895;
               2nd ed. 1928; most recent repr. 1995); <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der arabischen

               he learnt Hebrew and Syriac while working as a shop assistant. He was given funds to

               scholarship at Christ’s College, Cambridge. He became an assistant in the Oriental
               Antiquities Department of the British Museum in 1883, and in 1894 was appointed
               Keeper of Egyptian and Asiatic Antiquities in the British Museum, a post he held till
               his retirement in 1924. He was made a Knight in 1920. He made several visits to
               Mesopotamia (where he had a number of Syriac mss. copied for him), as well as to
               Egypt. Although best known for his many popular books on Egyptology, he also found
               time to publish numerous texts in Syriac, Coptic, and Ethiopic. His main editions and

                    <p>Biblical and Syriac scholar. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he
               studied mathematics and then theology. In 1903 he was appointed Lecturer in
               Palaeography in Cambridge University, and then in 1905 Norrisian Professor of
               Divinity, also in Cambridge. He was one of the scholars who worked on the Sinai
               palimpsest of the <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac Version</ref>. Most of his early
               publications were on Syriac topics, notably <hi rend="italic">S. Ephraim’s Quotations
                  from the Gospel</hi> (1901), <hi rend="italic">Early Eastern Christianity</hi>
               (1904), <hi rend="italic">Evangelion da-Mepharreshe</hi> (edition, translation, and
               study of the Curetonian ms. of the Old Syriac Gospels; 1904); he also completed the
               edition of <hi rend="italic">Ephrem’s Prose Refutations</hi> (2 vols.; 1912, 1921)
               after the death of C. W. Mitchell who was killed in the First World War. In the
               appendix to his <hi rend="italic">The Religion of the Manichees</hi> (1925) he edited
               the minute Syriac Manichaean fragments from Egypt. Most of his articles on Syriac
               topics were published in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Theological Studies</hi>.
               His views on early Syriac Christianity and on the authorship of the Peshitta revision
               of the New Testament have been very influential on English-speaking scholarship.
               Testimony to the enduring value of his article on <ref rend="bold">Christian
                  Palestinian Aramaic</ref> literature is the recent translation of this into
               Spanish. His beautifully neat Syriac handwriting served as a model for the small
               Syriac type face once used by the Cambridge University Press.</p>

                    <p>Lebanese Maronite priest and scholar. Born in the village of ʿAshqūt, he went to
               study in Rome, where he spent several years and made the acquaintance of Syriac
               scholars such as <ref rend="bold">Ignazio Guidi</ref>. It was in Rome that he published
               in 1875 his first major work, his <hi rend="italic">Liber thesauri de arte poetica
                  Syrorum</hi>(1875), which is an anthology of mainly later (classical) Syriac poets
               with Arabic introductions. For several of these poets, such as <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq
                  Qardaḥe Shbadnaya</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Israel of Alqosh</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Khamis bar Qardaḥe</ref>, Cardahi’s preliminary and fragmentary editions have not
               yet been replaced. In his grammar, also published in Rome (1880), Cardahi paid
               particular attention to Syriac meter (two later additions to his grammar followed in
               1903 and in 1923). In addition to a two-volume Syriac-Arabic dictionary (published by
               the Imprimerie catholique in Beirut in 1887–1891), he did two major editions of later
               Syriac texts: the ‘Paradise of Eden’ by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>
               (Beirut, 1889) and the ‘Book of the Dove’ by <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (Rome,

                    <p>The Monastery of St. Catherine on Sinai was founded in the 6th cent. It had a
               multicultural community prior to the Ottoman period when it became entirely Greek.
               Alongside its Greek, Georgian, and Arabic mss., the monastery preserves the most
               important collection of early Syriac mss., after that of <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  al-Suryān</ref>. The most famous of its manuscripts is Syr. 30, the palimpsest Old
               Syriac Gospels (unlike many of the monastery’s mss., which are now in western
               libraries, this ms. remains in Sinai). After a fire in 1975 a blocked up room with
               further fragmentary mss. in different languages, including Syriac, was discovered.
               Whereas Dayr al-Suryān has transmitted Syr. Orth. mss., those of St Catherine’s
               Monastery are almost all Melkite.</p>

                    <p>W.-Syr. encyclopedic work in nine books, dealing with theology, philosophy,
               anthropology, and natural sciences. The last part has been lost. In the introduction
               the author says he had been bp. of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> for 30 years, was then
               banned, and later recalled; eventually he preferred to retire to monastic life.
               Pohlmann attributed the ‘Cause of causes’ to <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>.
               Nöldeke observed Arabic influence on the terminology of the ‘Cause of causes’,
               especially concerning the geographical knowledge of Europe, and proposed a much later
               date (11th or 12th cent.). Since no one was bp. of Edessa for 30 years in the 12th
               cent., a possible candidate is the 11th-cent. bp. Athanasios. Baumstark interpreted
               the text as intended to promote mutual understanding between the various Christian
               denominations as well as between Christianity, Islam, and Judaism and thought that
               this universalistic attitude might be more consonant with the 10th cent. than
               later.</p>
                    <p>According to the author of ‘Cause of causes’, human knowledge may attain three
               different levels (natural, scriptural, and spiritual) thanks to three main sources
               (Reason, the Pentateuch, and the Gospels). The anthropology of ‘Cause of causes’
               follows the Neo- Platonic analogy according to which man is to nature as micro-cosmos
               is to macro-cosmos.</p>
                    <p>An extensive study of the sources has still to be made. According to Reinink, the
               author assimilates elements from various traditions such as the structure of
               hexaemeron-exegetical works (Yaʿqub of Edessa and <ref rend="bold">Mushe bar
                  Kipho</ref>) and motifs and themes of mystical-ascetical literature. Many
               parallels may be drawn with <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>, to whom the text
               is attributed in a marginal note in Latin, in ms. Vat. Lat. 6429, p. 133. The
               argumentation of ‘Cause of causes’, however, reflects the methodology of Christian
               anti-Muslim apologetics (see Christian Arabic writers such as the Melk. <ref rend="bold">Theo-doros Abū Qurra</ref>, 9th cent., and the Syr. Orth. <ref rend="bold">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref>, 10th cent.) and aims at strengthening the faith of a
               Christian, i.e. a Syr. Orth. readership living in a predominantly Islamic world.</p>

                    <p>Book containing a re-narration of the biblical history from the creation of the world
               to Pentecost by an unknown author (incorrectly ascribed to <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>). Parts of the Cave of Treasures were known to authors from the 6th
               cent. on. Internal evidence suggests that it was not composed before the 5th cent.
               (Leonhard; Ri assumes an earlier date). The ‘Cave of Treasures’ was written in
               Syriac, translated into Georgian and reworked in other languages. Its title refers to
               a legendary cave which is located near Paradise and which serves as the home as well
               as the place of burial and worship for the generations before the flood. For the time
               after the flood, the interest of the narrator shifts to Adam’s (secondary) burial
               place in Golgotha being the ‘center of the world’ (39.6–8) and the location of the
               important events of biblical history. The cave near Paradise is not mentioned any
               more. The text presents itself as esoteric lore and the only true background against
               which the Bible can be understood (43.13–4). It uses apocryphal traditions (e.g. the
               traditions on Adam and Eve) but also rewrites and expounds biblical texts and motifs.
               The ‘Cave of Treasures’ reconstructs the history of the OT by omitting the parts that
               are of paramount importance for Judaism, e.g. the time of Moses. The remarks on the
                  <ref rend="bold">Syriac language</ref> (24.11, 53.22–7) may betray the author’s
               interest in creating a distinctively Syriac version of biblical history.</p>

                    <p>Prefect of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan (1870–1907), editor of Syriac biblical
               texts. Monsignor A. M.  Ceriani is primarily known for his two impressive and
               carefully executed ‘photolithographic’ facsimile editions of early biblical mss.
               preserved in the Ambrosiana. The edition of the incomplete <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref> ms. (C 313 inf., 8th or 9th cent.) appeared in 1874; the
               edition of the OT <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> (ms. B 21 inf., 6th or 7th cent.), in
               two volumes, appeared between 1876 and 1883. These editions revolutionized Syriac
               biblical studies, as they gave scholars for the first time access to some of the
               earliest available mss. (both mss. came to Milan from <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  al-Suryān</ref>). Several decades later, the Milan Peshitta ms. was chosen as the
               base ms. for the critical edition of the OT Peshitta (Leiden, 1966–).</p>
                    <p>Ceriani was born in Uboldo (in the province of Varese, northwest of Milan) in 1828
               and was ordained a priest in 1852. He entered the Ambrosian Library in 1855 and
               became its Prefetto in 1870. His study of Semitic languages (including Hebrew,
               Aramaic, Syriac, and Arabic) can be traced back to his early years in the Milanese
               seminary, an institution to which he remained attached throughout his life as an
               instructor of ‘oriental’ languages, primarily Hebrew. He made two study trips to
               Great Britain, in 1861 and 1866, and for many years maintained epistolary contacts
               with F. Field (1801–85), <ref rend="bold">W. Wright</ref> (1830–89), and <ref rend="bold">R. Payne Smith</ref> (1818–95). He also had contacts with prelates of the Uniate
               Eastern churches.</p>

               Hautes Études. From this time on, he devoted his whole life to research in two
               fields, Semitic epigraphy, mainly Aramaic and Punic, and Syriac studies. In the
               first, he contributed through the redaction of thousands of notices of the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum</hi>, and he was the main editor of
               the first four volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Répertoire d’Épigraphie

               dedicated to this prestigious city. His work is also very important in North African
               studies where, in addition to the publication of Punic inscriptions, he explored the
               new field of Libyan inscriptions and published his important <hi rend="italic">Recueil des Inscriptions Libyques</hi> in two fascicules. In Syriac studies, his
               primary preoccupation was to put sources at the disposal of everyone. On the one

               in Milan). On the other hand, texts: his editions of Syriac texts are numerous, with
               Latin translations and short commentaries. To be noted are his <hi rend="italic">Histoire de Mar Jabalaha III</hi> (Paris 1895–96), the <hi rend="italic">Synodicon orientale</hi>(1902), the <hi rend="italic">Chronique de Michel le

                    <p>The Chaldean Catholic Church, which today constitutes the largest Church in Iraq, is
               the body which has resulted from some parts of the Ch. of E. coming into communion
               with the see of Rome since the 15th cent. The first such union was in Cyprus as early
               as 1445, but the Church now traces its patriarchal line to the consecration of <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref> as ‘Patriarch of Babylon’ in 1553. Relations
               between his successors and Rome became attenuated, and a second patriarchal line came
               into being at <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>(Diyarbakır) in 1681. (The second patriarch in
               this line, <ref rend="bold">Yawsep II</ref>, was an important literary figure.) The
               Diyarbakır patriarchate came to an end in 1828, and the Metropolitan of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, Yoḥannan Hormez, was confirmed as patr. in 1830. The line
               of patriarchs has been continuous from his time until the present, although the
               patriarchate was moved from Mosul to <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> in 1950.</p>
                    <p>The present patr., since 2003, is His Beatitude Mar Emmanuel III Delly Chaldean
               Patriarch of Babylon. (This is his full style. Mar Emmanuel was also made a Cardinal
               in 2007.) His see is in Baghdad. Also In Iraq, outside Baghdad, there are
               archdioceses of <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref>, Baṣra, Kirkuk, and Mosul, and dioceses
               of <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref>, Amadiyya, ʿAqra, Sulaymaniyya (Duhok), and Zakho; in
               Iran: Ahwaz, Salmas and <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref>, and Tehran; Syria: <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>; Lebanon: <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref>; Turkey: Istanbul (titular of
               Diyarbakır); Egypt: Cairo; United States: Southfield, MI and San Diego, CA. Since
               1990 all the Eastern Catholic Churches have had their own Code of Canon Law. In 1990
               Babel College, for higher theological and philosophical studies, was established in
               Baghdad, with <ref rend="bold">Y. Habbi</ref>as its President (1991–2000); in 2006,
               however, owing to the dangerous situation in Baghdad, Babel College had to be
               transferred to ʿAynkawa (near Arbil). In recent decades, as a result of the Iraq-Iran
               War, the sanctions after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and the lack of security that
               has resulted from the American and British invasion in 2003, large numbers have left
               Iraq and there are now many more Chaldeans living either as refugees in Syria and
               Lebanon, or as immigrants in the <ref rend="bold">diaspora</ref> (above all in North
               America), than remain in Iraq.</p>

                    <p>This is the term used for the Church in India (see <ref rend="bold">Thomas
                  Christians</ref>) which is part of the Ch. of E. Although the Church in South
               India had originally always been part of the Ch. of E. prior to the arrival of the
               Portuguese, once a Latin Catholic hierarchy had been established in Goa, the
               indigenous Christians came to be viewed as heretical Nestorians who were in need of
               conversion; by the end of the 16th cent. the Portuguese authorities had effectively
               cut off all connections with the Ch. of  E. in the Middle East, although in the early
               18th cent. two bishops of the Ch. of E. who had become Chald. (Shemʿon of ʿAda, d.
               1720; and Gabriel, d. 1731) came to India where they caused considerable confusion;
               thus it was only in the late 19th cent. that links with the Ch. of E. were
               successfully revived. The process was initiated by the Chald. Catholic Patr. of
               Babylon, Yawsep Audo (1848–78) who, in response to a request from a delegation from
               Malabar headed by Antony Thondanatta, and as a result of his desire to extend his
               jurisdiction to India, consecrated Thoma Rokos as metropolitan based in Trichur
               (1861). This, however, went against the wishes of Rome, and Rokos was obliged to
               return to the Middle East in 1862. Since Audo had been forbidden by Rome to
               consecrate anyone else for Malabar, the result was that Thondanatta was consecrated
               later that year as Mar ʿAbdishoʿ by Mar Shemʿon Rubel, the Patr. of the Ch. of E.,
               thus reviving the long-broken link. These links were strengthened with the
               appointment of two Middle Eastern metropolitans to Trichur, Mar <ref rend="bold">Abimalek Timotheus</ref> (1908–45) and Mar <ref rend="bold">Toma Darmo</ref>
               (1952–69). Relations between Mar Darmo and the Patr. broke down in the 1960s over
               issues of the patriarchal succession and (from 1964) the Calendar, after Mar <ref rend="bold">Eshai Shemʿon</ref> had changed to the Gregorian Calendar; in 1968 Darmo
               was elected as rival Patr., and one of the two Indian bishops he had ordained, Mar
               Aprem, became his successor as Metropolitan in Trichur. In 1971 Mar Shemʿon
               consecrated his own Metropolitan of Malabar, thus strengthening the schism between
               the Old and New Calendarists in India. Following the assassination of Mar Shemʿon in
               1975 and the election of Mar Denḥa IV as his successor in 1976, Mar Aprem (at that
               time under Mar Addai II) was active in trying to bring the two sides together, but it
               was only in 1995 that unity was achieved as far as the Indian situation was
               concerned, and the Chald. Syrian Church in India became united with Mar Dinkha.</p>
                    <p>Mar Timotheos had been anxious to set up a printing press in Trichur, and with this
               in mind he brought <ref rend="bold">Yawsep d-Beth Qelayta</ref> to India, but it was
               only in 1926, after Yawsep had left, that the Mar Narsai Press was established in
               Trichur, in order to print Syriac liturgical texts. However, it was not until the
               time of Mar Darmo that many Syriac texts were published; amongst these was the <hi rend="italic">Ḥudrā</hi>(3 vols.; 1960–62), as well as a few literary texts
               (including some in Modern Syriac). At the time of the disputes between Mar Darmo and
               the Patr., numerous pamphlets were produced at the Press. Since Mar Darmo’s death,
               apart from the printing (in 1982) of Timotheos I’s Letters (1–38), left ready by
               Darmo, hardly any further Syriac texts were published, apart from offset
               reproductions.</p>
                    <p>The Chaldean Syrian Church is said to have ca. 30,000 adherents.</p>

               called Chaldeans on account of a historical connection with the ancient people of
               that name can be found in 19th-cent. books by W. Ainsworth, A. H. Layard, and Hormuzd
               Rassam. This idea was taken up by P. Nasri (1905) and <ref rend="bold">Addai
                  Scher</ref> (1912) and then by other nationalistic writers from the Chaldean

               was linked to the Assyrian Ch. of E. Recent writers have taken a more nuanced
               position, allowing both names, Assyrian and Chaldean, as ‘symbols of ethnic identity
               and pride’ appropriate to Christians with ancient roots in Mesopotamia, yet
               preferring Chaldean as reflecting ‘a more comprehensive and generic identity’ (S.

                    <p>One of the centers of the <ref rend="bold">Assyrian diaspora</ref> in the USA. The
               first Assyrians in Chicago in the 1890s were young men who had attended American
               mission schools in <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref>, Persia. By 1924, the population was
               reported to be 2,327; this reflected immigration after the displacement of Assyrians
               from Persia and <ref rend="bold">Hakkari</ref> after World War  I. The main Assyrian
               church was the Carter Memorial Presbyterian Church, but other Protestant
               denominations, as well as the <ref rend="bold">Chaldean Syrian Church</ref> and the
                  <ref rend="bold">Ch. of E.</ref>, were also represented. Newer immigrants, in
               considerable numbers since the 1950s, have been from Iraq, and Assyrians of Iraqi
               origin now predominate in the community. The patriarchatal see of the Church of the
               East was in Chicago 1940–54 (under Mar <ref rend="bold">Eshai Shemʿon</ref>) and is so
               again since 1976 under Mar Denḥa IV. The 1990 census numbered Assyrians in Chicago at
               13,387.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>It remains uncertain when Christians first reached the main, historically
               Chinese-speaking (Han), part of China. The tradition of making St. Thomas the apostle
               of China, which appears in such E.-Syr. sources as <ref rend="bold">Ibn
               al-Ṭayyib</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Fiqh al-naṣrāniyya</hi> (VI.1.41, ed.
               Hoenerbach-Spies II.138.7–8), <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Nomocanon</hi> (IX.1, ed. Mai 317a 14–15), and the Chaldean
               breviary, can be found in its nascent form in the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of
                  Zuqnin</ref> and may have originated in the late Sasanian period (see Tubach
               1995–6). Although it is likely that individual Christians travelling along the Silk
               Road reached China before the 7th cent., there is little evidence to support the
               historicity of the tradition reported by ʿAbdishoʿ (<hi rend="italic">Nomocanon</hi>
               VIII.15, ed. Mai 304a 20–21) which credits the Ch. of E. Catholicoi Aḥai (410–414)
               and Shila (503–523) with the erection of a metropolitan see for China. ʿAbdishoʿ
               himself gives the credit to Ṣliba Zka (714–28), while Ishoʿyahb (probably <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> [649–59]) is given the honor by Ibn al-Ṭayyib (<hi rend="italic">Fiqh al-naṣrāniyya</hi> VI.1.16, ed. Hoenerbach-Spies II.121.4–5).
               The existence of metropolitans for China in the time of <ref rend="bold">Timotheos
                  I</ref> (780–823) is attested to by his letter mentioning the death of a
               ‘metropolitan of Beth Ṣinaye’ (Letter 13, ed. Braun 109.22–23) and by the report by
                  <ref rend="bold">Toma of Marga</ref>, told on the authority of Timotheos, of Dawid,
               a monk of <ref rend="bold">Beth ʿAbe</ref>, being elected metropolitan for ‘Beth
               Ṣinaye’ (‘Book of Governors’, IV.20, ed. Budge 238.14–15).</p>
                    <p>The history of Christianity in China as recorded in the so-called <ref rend="bold">Xi’an</ref> Stele (erected in 781) and other Chinese documents begins with the
               arrival of the missionary Aluoben in Chang’an (present-day Xi’an) in 635 and his
               reception by Emperor Taizong (626–49). The Stele goes on to tell us of the progress
               of Christianity in China under the protection of the successive emperors. Like the
                  <ref rend="bold">Thomas Christians</ref> in India, the Syriac Christians in China
               were subject to bishops sent to them from their mother Church in the West. If the
               term <hi rend="italic">dade</hi> used in the Stele is equivalent to ‘bishop’ (or
               ‘metropolitan’), these bishops will include, besides Aluoben, Jilie (Gabriel) in the
               first half of 8th cent., Jihe (Giwargis or Gigoy?), who arrived in 744, and Yaolun
               (Yoḥannan), who was <hi rend="italic">dade</hi> and <hi rend="italic">apesqopā</hi>
               at the time of the erection of the Stele.</p>
                    <p>Chinese records from the early Tang period refer to Christianity as the religion of
               Persia (Bosi) and, after 745, as that of the Roman (or Byzantine) Empire (<hi rend="italic">Da Qin</hi>), while the Christians themselves called their religion
                  <hi rend="italic">Jingjiao</hi>, or the ‘luminous religion’. The Persian term <hi rend="italic">tarsā</hi> was also sometimes used of Christians in China and
               appears in the form <hi rend="italic">dasuo</hi> in the Xi’an Stele. Although there
               is evidence for the existence of a number of Christian communities outside Chang’an,
               the passage of the Stele telling us that monasteries were built in every ‘prefecture’
               of the land (of which there were approximately 360) during the reign of Gaozong
               (650–83) is clearly exaggerated. It is likely that Christians, like the Manicheans
               and Zoroastrians who also entered China along the Silk Road in the middle of the
               first millennium, remained a small minority and, consisting mainly of peoples of
               Iranian origin (Persians and Sogdians), were generally regarded as a ‘foreign’
               element within the Chinese population.</p>
                    <p>The decline of <hi rend="italic">Jingjiao</hi> in the 9th cent. is no doubt to be
               attributed to increasing political instability and difficulty of travel along the
               Silk Road. Emperor Wuzong’s edict of 845 proscribing ‘foreign’ religions, though
               aimed primarily at Buddhists, evidently had a devastating effect on Christianity, as
               well as on Manichaeism and Zoroastrianism, in China. Little is heard of the
               Christians in China after 845, although the mention in an Arabic source of
               ‘Christians’, along with Muslims, Jews, and Zoroastrians, among the groups massacred
               in Guanzhou (Canton) during the rebellion of Huang Chao in 878/9 has been interpreted
               as indicating their survival for a period in southern China, while the wording of the
               colophon of the ms. containing the <hi rend="italic">Sanwei mengdu zan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zun jing</hi> (nos. 3 and 4 below) has been understood to indicate
               that it was copied after the fall of the Tang Dynasty in 907, suggesting the survival
               of Christian communities using Chinese after that date.</p>
                    <p>Besides in the Xi’an Stele (properly, the ‘Monument on the propagation of the
               Religion of the Light of Da Qin in China’, <hi rend="italic">Da Qin Jingjiao liuxing
                  Zhongguo bei</hi>), what remains of the literary activities of the Christians in
               Chinese during the Tang period is to be found in a number of documents discovered in
               the early 20th cent. in Dunhuang. The so-called Dunhuang Christian documents
               comprise: 1. <hi rend="italic">Xuting Mishisuo jing</hi> (‘Book of Jesus-Messiah’ or
               ‘Book of listening to the Messiah’; Takakusu ms.); 2. <hi rend="italic">Yishen
                  lun</hi> (‘Discourse on the One God’, consisting of three disparate treatises;
               Tomioka ms.); 3. <hi rend="italic">Da Qin Jingjiao Sanwei mengdu zan</hi> (‘Hymn in
               adoration of the Holy Trinity’); 4. <hi rend="italic">Zun jing</hi> (‘Book of honor’
               or [list of] ‘Venerable books’); 5. <hi rend="italic">Zhi xuan anle jing</hi> (‘Book
               on attaining profound peace and joy’); 6a. Beginning of <hi rend="italic">Da Qin
                  Jingjiao Xuan yuan zhiben jing</hi> (‘Book of proclamation of the highest origin
               of origins’); 6b. End of <hi rend="italic">Da Qin Jingjiao Xuan yuan zhiben jing</hi>
               (Kojima ms. B); 7. <hi rend="italic">Da Qin Jingjiao Dasheng tongzhen guifa zan</hi>
               (‘Hymn of praise for the Transfiguration of Our Lord’; Kojima ms. A). Of these, no. 3
               is a paraphrase of the Great Doxology (i.e. the equivalent of the Latin <hi rend="italic">Gloria [in excelsis Deo]</hi>); the remaining texts, though clearly
               Christian in content, appear to be original compositions and have no known
               counterparts in Syriac. No. 6b is now known to be a modern forgery, and the same is
               most likely to be the case with no. 7. Nos. 1 and 2 have been associated by scholars
               with the missionary activity of Aluoben. It has been suggested that the manuscripts
               we have today of these two texts too are modern forgeries, though based on genuine
               Tang-Dynasty documents (see Lin 2006). The remaining texts have been judged to date
               from a later period; nos.  3, 5, and 6 may have been composed by Jingjing, who was
               responsible also for the text of the Xi’an Stele. An important new addition was made
               to this corpus in 2006 with the discovery in Luoyang, the ‘eastern capital’ of the
               Tang Dynasty, of a stone pillar, which was erected by a family evidently of Sogdian
               origin in 814/5 and which, though missing its lower part, is inscribed with a more
               complete text of no. 6 than is found in the Dunhuang manuscript (see Ge 2009 and Tang
               2009).</p>
                    <p>After the turn of the millennium, the presence of Syriac Christians in China becomes
               perceptible again during the 12th cent. with the movement into northern China of
               those Turkic tribes that counted E.-Syr. converts among their members, and reached a
               new peak during the period of the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368), whose Mongol rulers were
               in close marital and political alliances with Turco-Mongol tribal federations with
               strong Christian elements, such as the Kerait and the Öngüt. The open religious
               policy of Genghis Khan and his heirs, the expansion of their empire to the far
               western parts of Eurasia, and the resulting facilitation of east-west travel both by
               land and by sea led to the arrival also of non-Syriac Christians in China, including
               Latin missionaries and traders, as well as Armenians, Alans, and Georgians. The term
                  <hi rend="italic">Yelikewen</hi> (Turkic/Mongolian <hi rend="italic">Erke’ün</hi>), whose etymology remains unclear, was used to refer to Christians of
               all these denominations in the Chinese records from this period.</p>
                    <p>We learn from the ‘History of Mar Yahbalaha’ that there was a Ch. of E. metropolitan
               in Khan Baliq (Dadu, modern Beijing), which Khubilai Khan officially made his capital
               in 1272, by the middle of the 13th cent., and it was from Khan Baliq that <ref rend="bold">Rabban Ṣawma</ref> and the Öngüt monk Marqos, the future Cath. <ref rend="bold">Yahbalaha III</ref>, set out for the West in around 1275. As during the
               Tang period, the Christian population of Yuan China evidently consisted largely of
               ‘foreign’, non-Han, elements, usually of Turkic origin. Official and semi-official
               Chinese sources, accounts left by members of Latin mendicant orders and by Marco
               Polo, and archaeological evidence, including a large number of crosses and funerary
               inscriptions, sometimes written in Syriac and more often in Turkic in Syriac script
               (see <ref rend="bold">Inscriptions</ref>, ‘Central and East Asia’), testify to the
               presence of Syriac Christians, besides in cities along the Silk Road, especially in
               Inner Mongolia and in the southern port city of Quanzhou (Zaitun), as well as in the
               area around Beijing and in commercial centers around the lower reaches of the
               Changjiang (Yangtze River), such as Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Hangzhou.</p>
                    <p>The history of Syriac Christianity in China more or less came to a close with the
               fall of the Yuan Dynasty to the native Chinese Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), although the
               possible survival of some descendants of these Christians into a later period is
               suggested by a fragmentary ms. of <ref rend="bold">Qdām w-Bāthar</ref> which was
               discovered within the imperial palace complexes in Beijing in 1909 and may date from
               the 15th or 16th cent.</p>

                    <p>A Late Aramaic dialect (also misleadingly known as Palestinian Syriac) which was
               employed by Chalcedonian Christian communities in Palestine and Transjordan from ca.
               5th–14th cent., after which it disappeared. The oldest texts (ca. 5th–8th centuries)
               are inscriptions and fragmentary mss. (often in the form of the underwriting in
               palimpsest mss., many of which are connected with <ref rend="bold">St. Catherine’s
                  Monastery</ref>, Sinai). Complete mss. (all liturgical) only date from the 11th
               cent. or later. All the surviving literary texts are translations from Greek, the
               only exception being a short magical work. The older mss. contain biblical and
               patristic texts, the former often being in the form of lectionaries, whose rubrics
               sometimes conform with the old Jerusalem liturgical rite which is otherwise best
               attested in Armenian and Georgian sources. The best preserved (though none is
               complete) among the patristic texts are parts of <ref rend="bold">Cyril of
                  Jerusalem</ref>’s Catecheses, and two hagiographical texts, the ‘Forty Martyrs of
               Sinai’, and the narrative concerning Eulogius the Stonecutter (belonging to the cycle
               of texts associated with Daniel of Scetis). Other very fragmentary texts include some
               works attributed to <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> (but which are only known in Greek),
               and the narratives of Alexis the <ref rend="bold">Man of God</ref> and of Abraham of
               Qidun (both of which reached Christian Palestinian Aramaic by way of Greek). There
               are also fragments of <ref rend="bold">Athanasius</ref>’s ‘Life of Antony’, a homily on
               the Prodigal Son attributed to <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref>, various
               Apophthegmata, and some apocryphal and hagiographical texts.</p>
                    <p>Among the later mss. are three dated Gospel Lectionaries, of 1030, 1104, and 1118.
               The first of these (ms. Vat. Syr. 19) was the first text in this dialect to be
               published (in 1861–4). Also from the later period are two further important
               liturgical mss., a Euchologion and a Horologion.</p>
                    <p>The texts preserved in the older mss. are in the course of re-publication by C.
               Müller-Kessler and M. Sokoloff.</p>

                    <p>The (anonymous) Chronicle of 1234 is a developed universal chronicle (<hi rend="italic">maktbonuto d-zabne</hi>) first composed in 1204. From the reign of
               Constantine the Great onward the text is divided into a secular and an ecclesiastical
               history. After the concluding remarks for the year 1204, there are additional entries
               in the secular history up to 1234 (with some references extending to 1237), ending
               with a lacuna, and in the ecclesiastical history up to 1207, where the ms. breaks
               off. It is doubtful if these additions were made by the original author.</p>
                    <p>The text was preserved in a 14th cent. ms. the whereabouts of which are now unknown.
               In the 19th  cent. the ms. had been repaired by inserting new folia replacing damaged
               parts, although some parts were beyond repair. Chabot maintains that the text of the
               new folia was copied from the damaged 14th-cent. ms.</p>
                    <p>The original author was a younger contemporary of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Michael
                  Rabo</ref> (1166–99) and in 1173 was present at the patriarchal residence in the
                  <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref>. He also personally experienced the
               conquest of <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> by Saladin in 1187, when Athanasios, the
               brother of Michael, was bp. of Jerusalem. He accompanied Maph. Grigorios, nephew of
               Michael, to <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref> and the eastern dioceses in 1189 and seems to
               have been part of Grigorios’ entourage. He has detailed knowledge of the affairs of
               Michael and his family and is a staunch supporter of Michael. The author explicitly
               states that he will describe history as a succession of (religious) leadership from
               the first day of Creation to his own day, a succession of men, not of events. The
               Chronicle is based on the Eusebian model, but follows the later Syriac tradition in
               using many large narrative entries, sometimes even preserving the chapter structure
               of the sources. He, however, sometimes edits these sources. Although sharing many
               sources with Michael, the selection of material seems to have been made
               independently. He uses large fragments from the works of <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref> (or rather an extended Syriac version), <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref>, Basil of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, and other
               sources. He also uses pseudepigraphical material, especially for the time before
               Abraham, most notably from Jubilees and the <ref rend="bold">Cave of Treasures</ref>.
               There are also traces of unknown Arabic sources.</p>

                    <p>6th-cent. collection consisting of ca. 106 independent entries (‘lemmas’), most of
               them beginning with the precise indication of the year (‘In the year …’). It is
               preserved in six remaining folios of an ancient, probably 7th-cent., ms. (Vat. Syr.
               163) and has the title: <hi rend="italic">Tašʿyātā d-suʿrāne a(y)k
               da-b-pāsiqātā</hi>, ‘Narratives of events in brief’. Its importance was first
               recognized by J. S. Assemani, who provided an edition (with LT) in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Orientalis</hi>, vol. 1 (1719), 387–417. Later editions
               were done by L. Hallier (1892, with GT) and I. Guidi (1903, with LT).</p>
                    <p>Most of the entries either deal with, or are immediately relevant to, the history of
                  <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>. Hence modern scholars, since Assemani, have called it
               ‘Chronicle of Edessa’. The period covered extends from 133/2 BC (A. Gr. 180) to AD
               540, i.e. from the pre-Christian period (when Edessa was a kingdom under the <ref rend="bold">Abgarids</ref>) well into the time that most of Edessa was Christian.
               The work opens with an elaborate account of a flood in Edessa in November AD 201 (no.
               1; this contains a brief mention of damage done to ‘the sanctuary [<hi rend="italic">hayklā</hi>] of the church of the Christians’), and then steps back to the year
               133/2 BC, which is said to be when kings began to reign in Edessa (no. 2). With the
               exception of the flood account, the entries are few and sparse until the beginning of
               the 4th cent., when Bp. Qune is mentioned (no. 12). From then onwards entries become
               more frequent and more substantial, and regularly provide the names of the ruling
               bps. of the city. There are brief and rather detached references to <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>(no. 46), to Bps. <ref rend="bold">Rabbula</ref> (nos.
               51 and 59) and <ref rend="bold">Hiba</ref> (nos. 59, 60, 64, and 68), to the 449
               Council of Ephesus (no. 63), to the Council of Chalcedon (no. 66), to the closure of
               the <ref rend="bold">School of Edessa</ref> in 488/9 (no. 73), and to the
               anti-Chalcedonian policy of Emp. Anastasius (nos. 77, 83, and 84). The author’s
               language, however, becomes more personal when he reports about the religious policy
               of Emperors Justin I (518–527) and Justinian (527–565), and he empathetically
               mentions Justinian’s concern and care (<hi rend="italic">bṭiluthā w-yaṣṣiputhā</hi>)
               to have the four synods (including the one of Chalcedon) recognized (no. 95). It is
               likely, therefore, that this reflects the author’s own religious (Chalcedonian)
               perspective.</p>
                    <p>As the city archives are explicitly mentioned at the end of the flood account, the
               author may very well have had access to them, directly or, more likely, indirectly.
               Since some of the later Chronicles reflect the use of archival materials as well, it
               has been suggested that the chronicler excerpted entries from an earlier and more
               comprehensive chronicle (‘Original Chronicle of Edessa’), from which also some of the
               later chroniclers drew (see Witakowski).</p>
                    <p>As one of the rare sources with a focused interest in the early history of Edessa,
               the short Chronicle has received much attention in modern scholarship. The
               Chronicle’s extreme paucity of data on Christianity in Edessa prior to the beginning
               of the 4th cent.—while, tellingly, <ref rend="bold">Marcion</ref> (no. 6), <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref> (no. 7), and <ref rend="bold">Mani</ref> (no.  10) are
               explicitly mentioned—led Bauer to challenge the traditional view that ‘orthodox’
               Christianity preceded ‘heresy’ in Edessa, and to posit that prior to the early 4th
               cent. various Christian groups vied for power. It was only in the 4th cent., in his
               view, that ‘orthodox’ Christianity was able to assert itself and to oppress
               ‘non-orthodox’ groups, whose literary history subsequently fell into oblivion or was
               deliberately erased. In addition, scholars have noted the absence in the Chronicle of
               any reference to the conversion of the Abgarids or to the mission of Addai. This has
               contributed to the view that the legend of Addai, as found in the <ref rend="bold">Teaching of Addai</ref>, represents an attempt at ‘orthodox’ rewriting of early
               Edessene Christian history, an attempt that—as <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> shows in
               the 4th cent. and the Chronicle of Edessa in the 6th—was not necessarily universally
               accepted.</p>

                    </note>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>There are two basic types of chronicles in Syriac, local and universal (or world)
               chronicles. Local chronicles discuss the historical, religious, military, and
               economic conditions of specific regions, though incidental information on world
               history can also be included. The earliest local chronicle is the so-called Chronicle
               of <ref rend="bold">Yeshuʿ the Stylite</ref>, which deals with the effects of the
               Byzantine-Sasanian warfare on the Jazīra region in the early 6th cent. Universal
               chronicles deal with human history from the beginning of the world to the time of the
               writer. While early human history is based mostly on the Bible, the Hellenistic and
               subsequent periods are based on a variety of sources, mostly but not uniquely Greek,
               and for the Islamic period Syriac and sometimes Arabic sources are also used. The
               earliest universal chronicle is that of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (d.
               708), which includes a chronography and canons up to the year 692, extended by
               someone else to the year 710. This chronicle is incompletely preserved, though some
               gaps can be filled with quotations made from it by <ref rend="bold">Eliya of
                  Nisibis</ref> (d. 1046) and <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> (d. 1199). The <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref> written in 774 is universal but its latter
               part (part 4) is essentially local, concentrating on the economy of the Jazīra under
               the early Abbasids. Several universal chronicles are known only by the names of their
               authors, while others survived as extracts in other similar works. This is the case
               of the chronicle of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> (d. 845)
               largely quoted in <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of 1234</ref> (see below) and in the
               Chronicle of Patr. Michael Rabo. The latter massive Chronicle is divided into three
               parts in three columns, covering civil and religious histories in two columns and
               various events in the third one, all up to the year 1195. The chronicle was
               translated into Armenian and Arabic, though it survived in only one Syriac ms. The
               last two universal chronicles are the anonymous Chronicle of 1234 and the Chronicle
               of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (d.  1286), both divided into two rather than
               three parts, covering secular and ecclesiastical histories. In Bar ʿEbroyo’s
               Chronicle, secular history begins with the creation of the world and ends with the
               Mongol invasion, witnessed by the chronicler. The ecclesiastical history starts with
               Aaron and subsequent high priests; in the Christian era the chronicler concentrates
               on the patriarchs of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> and by the 7th cent. attention is
               drawn to the Syriac maphrians. In terms of genres, local chronicles are rooted in
               annals preserved in royal courts in such cities as <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> under
               the <ref rend="bold">Abgarids of Edessa</ref> and presumably elsewhere. Reference to
               the royal archives of Edessa is made by <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref> (d. 339), the
               mid-6th century <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, and Chronicle of 724.
               Syriac universal chronicles are modeled after Eusebius’s Chronicon and canons, of
               which there is more than one Syriac translation, though none has survived completely.
               Syriac writers followed Eusebius closely but not blindly. Thus, Yaʿqub of Edessa, in
               his Chronicle and canons made after Eusebius, supplements the list of rulers with
               names of Sasanian figures, corrects a calculation error in his model, and uses
               additional computation systems. This is also the attitude of the E.-Syr. Eliya of
               Nisibis in the first part of his Chronography, where the material is organized
               differently from his Eusebian model and in which he added information of interest to
               his own Church.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>The Church of the East traces its history to the earliest planting of Christianity in
               the Persian Empire. The fact that the church developed outside the Roman Empire and
               its conciliar process partly explains its particular doctrinal tradition. It
               represents a third position in the three-way split in Eastern Christianity that
               resulted from the Christological controversies of the 5th/6th cent., alongside the
               Syriac (and other Oriental) Orthodox and the Chalcedonian (Melkite, Rum) Orthodox
               Churches. The Church of the East follows the strictly dyophysite (‘two-nature’)
               christology of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, as a result of which it
               was misleadingly labelled as ‘Nestorian’ by its theological opponents.</p>
                    <p>Especially in the second half of the first millennium the Church expanded eastwards,
               reaching <ref rend="bold">China</ref> and south India (where the E.-Syr. tradition
               remains prominent today; see <ref rend="bold">Thomas Christians</ref>). From the 14th
               cent. onwards, however, the Church of the East became greatly diminished on account
               of plague, oppression, and periodic massacres. In the mid 16th cent. a separate
               patriarchal line developed, in communion with Rome (see <ref rend="bold">Chaldean
                  Catholic Church</ref>). By the 19th cent., the territory of the Church of the East
               was practically limited to the highlands of <ref rend="bold">Hakkari</ref> in Turkey
               and the plain around the city of <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref> in Iran. (Some
               congregations in India were reclaimed by the consecration of a bp. for them in 1907.)
               An estimated third of its people were victims of the massacres just before, during,
               and in the aftermath of the First World War (see <ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref>). The
               remnant of the Church were forced to settle in Iraq as refugees. Following the
               killing of Assyrian civilians by the Iraqi army at Semele in 1933, the Catholicos
               Patriarch (Mar <ref rend="bold">Eshai Shemʿon</ref>, then still treated as the civil
               head of all the <ref rend="bold">Assyrians</ref>) was expelled from Iraq.</p>
                    <p>In 1968 the Church suffered a schism, the immediate cause of which was the adoption
               of the New Calendar mandated by Mar Shemʿon in California. The government of Iraq
               favored the anti-Mar Shemʿon party and facilitated the election of Mar <ref rend="bold">Toma Darmo</ref> as a counter patr. Mar Darmo also made an issue of his
               opposition to the hereditary succession to the patriarchate. However, Mar Shemʿon had
               no nephews to succeed him, and in 1976, following his assassination, the new patr.
               Mar <ref rend="bold">Denḥa</ref> IV was elected canonically. The issue of succession
               thus no longer divides the two Church bodies, but other historical issues (of which
               the calendar is only one) and animosities continue to do so. Both Churches have now
               (2009) agreed to hold a joint synod to try to resolve differences (in India the
               matter was already resolved in 1995). Both Churches have large diasporas, especially
               in North America (see <ref rend="bold">diaspora</ref>).</p>
                    <p> 1. Assyrian Church of the East: Mar <ref rend="bold">Denḥa</ref> IV fixed the name of
               the Church as the ‘Holy Catholic Apostolic Assyrian Church of the East’. Like his
               predecessor he resides in the United States, although in <ref rend="bold">Chicago</ref>
               rather than California. There are dioceses in Iraq (<ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>,
               Duhok), Syria (al-Ḥasake), Lebanon (<ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref>), Western Europe
               (Norsborg, Sweden), Western United States (Glendale, Arizona), California, Canada
               (Toronto), India (Trissur), and Australia (Sydney). The bp. of Duhok also has
               responsibility for Russia (where there is a thriving church in Moscow). Since the mid
               1980s the Ch. of the East has been actively involved in <ref rend="bold">Ecumenical
                  dialogue</ref> with the Catholic Church, and in 1994 Mar <ref rend="bold">Denḥa</ref> IV and Pope John Paul II issued a historic common statement on
               christology. In 1997 the synods of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean
               Catholic Church agreed to take common steps to restore union between the two
               Churches; this process, however, has encountered a number of obstacles and little
               progress has been made so far.</p>
                    <p>2. Ancient Church of the East: The Church under Mar Toma Darmo (d. 1968) and his
               successor Mar Addai II (1972–) adopted the name ‘Ancient Church of the East’, to
               difference itself from the larger ‘Assyrian’ Church (and possibly to avoid a
               nationalistic-sounding name in Iraq). Mar Addai is resident in Baghdad. Outside
               Baghdad there are dioceses of Kirkuk, Nineveh (<ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>), Syria and
               Lebanon (residing in al-Ḥasake), Western Europe (Mainz, Germany), United States and
               Canada (San Fernando), and Western United States (Modesto). The Ancient Church of the
               East, as well as the Assyrian Church of the East, has been present at Pro Oriente’s
               Non-Official ‘Syriac Dialogue’ since its inception in 1994.</p>

                    <p>He was born in Upper Kafro and studied Syriac in <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  al-Zaʿfarān</ref> under <ref rend="bold">Dolabani</ref> who ordained him a deacon in
               1958. In 1961 he became a monk and became the principal of the seminary at <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref> in 1962. In 1977 he became a Patriarchal
               Vicar to Central Europe and the Benelux, and he was consecrated a bp. in 1979. He
               established St. Ephrem Monastery in the Netherlands at Glane-Losser, and he was
               instrumental in the establishment of two other monasteries in Europe, i.e. Mar Awgen
               in Switzerland and Mar Yaʿqub in Germany (Warburg). He established Bar Hebraeus
               Verlag where he edited and published many books scribed in his own hand prior to the
               development of computer fonts, then moved to using computer fonts. He established and
               edited <hi rend="italic">Kolo Süryoyo</hi> from 1978 until his death in 2005. Most of
               the anonymous editorials, articles, and news reports written in Syriac in <hi rend="italic">Kolo Süryoyo</hi> are by him, but he rarely published works under
               his own name.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of Rome (ca. 88 – ca. 97) and author. Clement has traditionally been identified
               as the author of 1 Clement, a pastoral letter written in Greek in Rome (ca. 96),
               responding to problems associated with a schism in the church at Corinth. A number of
               later works came also to be linked spuriously with Clement. The resulting corpus has
               left traces in several strands of the Syriac tradition.</p>
                    <p>From an early date, 1 Clement circulated with an anonymous homily titled 2 Clement,
               composed ca. 130–150 in Syria or Egypt. A Syriac version of both texts occurs in a
               ms. containing the complete Ḥarqlean NT (ms. Camb. Add. 1700, dated 1170). In that
               ms., 1–2 Clement appear with the Catholic Epistles and have been fully incorporated
               into the lectionary cycle. Although the scribe appears to have believed 1–2 Clement
               were translated with the rest of the Ḥarqlean NT, the version is in fact distinct,
               probably 7th-cent, and possibly a product of the School of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of
                  Edessa</ref>. Fragments of a somewhat revised version of 1 Clement survive in a
               few modern Syriac mss.</p>
                    <p>Two ascetical letters ‘To the Virgins’ were attributed to Clement as early as <ref rend="bold">Epiphanius</ref>’s time, but were in fact composed in the late 3rd or
               early 4th cent., probably in a Syro-Palestinian environment. The Greek survives only
               in fragments, but a Syriac version exists in a 15th-cent. ms. (now in Amsterdam, ed.
               Beelen) and in two more recent mss. (Birmingham, Mingana Syr. 480 [see Brock] and
               Manchester, John Rylands Libr., Syr. 11). There are also some earlier fragments in
               Coptic and in a few Syriac anthologies.</p>
                    <p>The Pseudo-Clementines comprise the Homilies and the Recognitions, two interdependent
               4th-cent. works that appear to go back to a common source from mid-3rd-cent. Syria.
               Together they present a colorful, if fictional, account of Clement’s conversion to
               Christianity, his subsequent adventures with the apostle Peter, and his reunion with
               his family. Composed in Greek, the Pseudo-Clementines quickly found their way into
               Syriac  — the very early ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150 (dated 411) contains substantial
               portions of the Recognitions and the Homilies, as does the 6th-cent. ms. Brit. Libr.
               Add. 14,609. The two texts are the work of different translators. Late Greek copies
               of the Homilies are extant, but the Recognitions, apart from very small fragments,
               have been lost in Greek. They survive only in Rufinus’s Latin translation and in the
               Syriac version, which is the more reliable. Adaptations of the Pseudo-Clementines’s
               narrative material also appear in later Syriac epitomes.</p>
                    <p>A collection of canons known as the Octateuch of Clement was translated into Syriac
               in the late 7th cent. Supposed to reflect the editorial work of Clement, the
               Octateuch contains such works as the Apostolic Constitutions and the <ref rend="bold">Testament of our Lord Jesus Christ</ref>. Often copied, excerpted, and
               translated, the Syriac version widely influenced canon law in Eastern Christian
               traditions. A number of W.-Syr. liturgical mss. have an Anaphora attributed to
               Clement, the final form of which probably dates no earlier than the 7th cent.</p>

                    <p>Colophons, or notes added by the scribe at the end of a ms. that he is copying, often
               provide a great deal of valuable information; this will often consist of the scribe’s
               name (and parentage), date, place of writing, the person who commissioned the work
               and its destination, and the name(s) of the reigning hierarchs. For the date, the
               Seleucid era is normally used (to find the AD equivalent, subtract 311, or if the
               month is Oct.-Dec., 312). Already by the late 7th cent. the Hijra dating is sometimes
               also used, and Melkite mss. frequently employ the Byzantine World Era (subtract 5508,
               or if Sep.–Dec., 5509). Other eras (e.g. of the Ascension) are only rarely found.
               From the 17th cent. onwards the Christian era is also employed, sometimes in
               conjunction with the Seleucid (which continued in use well into the 20th cent.). In
               India the Kulam era (beginning AD 825) is sometimes used. Dates given (sometimes
               including the hour as well as the day) will refer to that of completion; only rarely
               does the scribe indicate when he started: a recent example is provided by Mor <ref rend="bold">Julius Çiçek</ref>’s calligraphed Gospel Lectionary, published in 1987:
               his long colophon states that it took him 340 hours, starting on 5 Jan. and finishing
               on 4 Feb. Information about the place of writing, if not a monastery, may include the
               church, as well as the village or town. Later owners have sometimes substituted later
               names, erasing the original ones. In order to discourage unauthorized removal of a
               ms. dire curses on any would-be culprit may be provided. Further information of a
               purely historical nature is occasionally to be found in colophons: a dramatic example
               of this is in a ms. written in <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> in 1149 (ms. Damascus,
               Patr. 12/4) whose colophon describes the capture of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> by
               Zengi in 1144 (ET by A. N. Palmer, in <hi rend="italic">OC</hi> 76 [1992], 85–7).</p>
                    <p>The oldest dated Christian ms. in any language is Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150, whose
               colophon states that it was written in Edessa and completed in Nov. 411. A  number of
               formulaic features are apt to reappear, such as the comparison of the scribe reaching
               his last line with that of a ship, or sailor, reaching harbor; this particular
               example, first known from a ms. of 543, and still in use in modern times, is also
               found in Greek and Latin mss.</p>

                    <p>The term ‘Syriac Computing’ was coined in 1992 with the establishment of the Syriac
               Computing Institute, the forerunner of Beth Mardutho: The Syriac Institute, and took
               shape in 1995 when the First International Forum on Syriac Computing was held in
               conjunction with the Second Syriac Symposium in Washington, DC (see <ref rend="bold">Syriac Conferences</ref>). The term applies to computer-related activities and
               projects which support Syriac studies. Previous activities covered the following
               domains:</p>
                    <p>1. Lexicography and concordance generation. The main focus of projects in the past
               has been on computational lexicography. The first computational project, which was
               done at UCLA probably around the 1960s, encoded Brockelmann’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Syriacum</hi> on a mainframe, but nothing more is known about it. In the
               1970s, the Göttingen-based Göttinger Syrische Konkordanz project produced OT text
               concordances under the direction of Werner Strothmann, and The Way International
               produced a morphologically tagged database for the text of the NT. In the 1980s, the
               Peshitta Institute in Leiden developed further systems for the creation of OT
               concordances. Also in the 1980s, G. Kiraz developed the SEDRA database for the text
               of the NT. In the 1990s, Brigham Young University commissioned G.  Kiraz to develop
               the Bar Bahlul lexical database. The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon project, under the
               direction of Stephen Kaufman, collects texts and lexical resources, taggs them
               morphologically, and makes them available online, and has produced a concordance of
               the <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac Version</ref>of the Gospels. More involved linguistic
               analysis of Syriac texts is part of the CALAP and Turgama projects of the Peshitta
               Institute where the aim is to analyze texts at the word, phrase, clause, and text
               levels.</p>
                    <p>2. Word processing and desktop publishing. The first publications that employed
               computer technology for the production of Syriac text, viz. the concordances of the
               Göttingen project, used plotter technology. With the rise of personal computers in
               the early 1980s, a number of non-commercial Macintosh-based outline fonts were
               available. Users of the DOS platform primarily used the bitmap fonts made by Alaph
               Beth Computer System for a program called Multi-Lingual Scholar (Gamma Productions,
               Inc.) from 1986 onward. When Windows became ubiquitous in the 1990s, a few TrueType
               outline fonts became available, but texts had to be typed either backward or on the
               Arabic version of Windows. The development of the bi-directional Windows 2000 and XP
               operating systems provided native bi-directional editing for the first time at the
               operating system level. At the same time, OpenType font technology allowed for
               encoding language-specific features of a script (e.g., shapes of letters, joining
               rules, ligatures, etc.) inside the font itself. The primary fonts that made use of
               these technologies are Meltho fonts by S. Hasso, G. Kiraz, and P. Nelson. Numerous
               other fonts have become available recently. Yannis Haralambous designed a system
               called Sabra for the TeX typesetting system, which was used in a few
               publications.</p>
                    <p>3. Standards. In February 1998, a proposal was presented to the Unicode Consortium to
               add Syriac to Unicode, an encoding system for scripts. Syriac became officially part
               of Unicode 3.0 in 2000. Six Syriac letters for use in Sogdian and Persian were
               incorporated into Unicode 5.0 in 2007. Syriac letters used for Malayalam Garshuni
               have not yet been proposed. The name of the Syriac language is also part of ISO 639
               where it is designated by ‘Sy’ in the two-letter codes and ‘Syr’ in the three-letter
               codes.</p>
                    <p>4. Digitization of mss. and books. The Hill Museum and Manuscript Library (HMML)
               digitized a few Syriac manuscripts from European libraries in the 1970s as part of a
               larger digitization project that did not primarily involve Syriac. In 2000 and 2002
               Brigham Young University digitized 33 mss. from the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana
               and published them on a CD ROM. From 2003, HMML began a systematic effort to digitize
               Syriac collections in the Middle East including the libraries of Balamand, Kaslik
               (started by BYU), and the monasteries and churches of the Lebanese Maronite Order
               (ca. 1,000 mss), the Bibliothèque Orientale, Université Saint-Joseph (also started by
               BYU), <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> (both the Church of the Forty Martyrs and <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>, ca. 1100 mss), <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Mor
                  Gabriel</ref> (ca. 450 mss), <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> (Syr. Orth. and Syr.
               Cath., ca. 775 mss), and the Missionaires Libanais in Jounieh (ca. 1000 mss). Work is
               underway in <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref> and Kerala (where Istvan Perzcel initiated a
               digitization project). Beth Mardutho: The Syriac Institute initiated a digitization
               project of printed books. The main digitization took place at the ICOR Library of the
               Catholic University of America in 2004 with BYU as a partner. Beth Mardutho’s
               collection of ca. 700 books was deposited with HMML. BYU digitized ca. 400 books.
               Mass digitization projects by Google, Microsoft, and others incidentally contain
               digital versions of books on Syriac studies.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>From the earliest period of Christian history, contacts and interaction existed
               between Egypt and the Syriac world. For some of the Coptic writings of the Nag
               Hammadi Library, such as the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Philip, the existence
               of a Syriac original has often been presumed, going back to the 2nd cent. Even if
               such a Syr. original once existed, it is unclear whether the Coptic translation would
               have been made directly from Syr. or from a Greek intermediary. For the five Coptic
                  <ref rend="bold">Odes of Solomon</ref> that are incorporated in the Gnostic
               collection known as ‘Pistis Sophia’ (generally dated to the 2nd half of the 3rd
               cent.), the source language was almost certainly Greek (regardless of whether the
               Odes were originally written in Greek or Syr.). Some Coptic Manichean texts, however,
               were translated directly from a (lost) Syr. original, and recent discoveries in the
               Dakhla oasis have provided fascinating evidence of the immediate coexistence of
               Coptic and Manichean Syr. (or at any rate an Aramaic dialect, very close to Syr. in
               both language and script). The Dakhla findings include, among other things, some
               wooden tablets with a Syr.-Coptic glossary (ed. Franzmann).</p>
                    <p>Within the Christian Roman Empire, contacts between Christians in Egypt and in Syria
               and Mesopotamia intensified. Egyptian desert asceticism attracted interest and visits
               from Syr. Christians, and several writings about the Desert Fathers became known in
               Syr. as early as the 5th cent. It is very telling that the later Syr. tradition of
               the <ref rend="bold">Life of Ephrem</ref> lets Ephrem travel to Egypt and spend several
               years in Scetis, where he met with Bishoi, one of the founders of Coptic monasticism
               (a legend that lives on in <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> to the present day).
               This should be seen as part of the process of ‘egyptianization’ of Syr. asceticism
               (Becker), which tended to minimize or erase the indigenous Syr. roots of asceticism
               and look for legitimization in the Egyptian tradition of desert asceticism, by giving
               precedence to texts and persons of Egyptian origin, by re-identifying the authors of
               existing works as Egyptians, and even by inventing Egyptian founding fathers of
               asceticism, such as <ref rend="bold">Mar Awgen</ref>.</p>
                    <p>In the development of Christian doctrine, the patriarchates of Alexandria and <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> played an equally important role. Tensions between the two
               patriarchates, however, came to the fore and formed much of the background against
               which the Council of Ephesus (431) was held, which was seen as a victory for <ref rend="bold">Cyril of Alexandria</ref> over <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref>, the
               latter being associated with Antiochene Christianity. In the wake of the Council,
               however, reconciliation between Antiochene and Alexandrian bishops took place (433).
               The subsequent Christological debate brought many Egyptian and Syr. Christians closer
               together in their rejection of the two-nature formula of the Council of Chalcedon
               (451), to which they opposed the ‘Miaphysite’ doctrine of the one nature in Christ,
               in which both the full humanity and full divinity are preserved. While both Egyptian
               and Syr. Christians were divided between Chalcedonians and anti-Chalcedonians, the
               latter were able in the course of the 6th cent. to build a church structure that
               became the foundation for the Miaphysite Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt and for the
               Miaphysite Syr. Orth. Church in Syria. They did so in defiance of the imperial
               authorities who, after some hesitation in the late 5th and early 6th cent. resolutely
               chose for strict adherence to Chalcedon with the accession of Emperor Justin I (518).
                  <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref>, since 512 Miaphysite Patr. of Antioch, fled to Egypt
               in 518, where he not only continued to lead the Syr. Orth. community, but also forged
               a strong alliance with the Church of Alexandria, arguing that in times of oppression
               the two Churches needed to act as one. Severus won for himself lasting authority in
               both the Syr. and the Coptic churches. At his death (538), the Syr. Miaphysites
               turned for leadership to <ref rend="bold">Theodosius</ref>, the exiled Patr. of
               Alexandria who lived in Constantinople, thus again giving expression to the idea that
               the Miaphysites in Egypt and in Syria should be united. It was only in the late 550s
               that attempts were made to reestablish an independent Syr. Orth. patriarch. Towards
               the end of the 6th cent., a theological dispute broke out between the Egyptian Patr.
               Damian (569–605) and the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref rend="bold">Peter of Kallinikos</ref>
               (581–91). This was healed only in 616 by Patr. Anastasius of Alexandria (605–16) and
               the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref rend="bold">Athanasios I Gamolo</ref>. By that time both the
               Syr. and the Coptic Miaphysite churches had fully adopted Severus’s theology as their
               foundation (rejecting the teachings of <ref rend="bold">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref>,
               which enjoyed a certain degree of popularity throughout the 6th cent.). Although the
               Coptic and Syr. Miaphysite Churches henceforth existed as separate churches, there
               was full doctrinal agreement, which opened the way to different ways of contact and
               interaction. Particularly important was the exchange of a ‘synodical letter’ at the
               election of a new patriarch, expressing and reaffirming the communion between the two
               Churches. Throughout the 6th cent. the language of communication between the
               Alexandrians and Antiochenes was Greek, and the Coptic translations of Severus’s
               oeuvre are based on the Greek originals, not on the Syr. translations. In the early
               Islamic period, the language of communication quickly became Arabic, while Syr. and
               Coptic continued to be used within the individual churches.</p>
                    <p>The absence of any dogmatic barrier made it possible for Syr. Christians to fully
               integrate into the Coptic Church. This happened on different levels. On the highest
               level, four Christians of Syr. origin or descent served as patr. of the Coptic Church
               (Damian: 579–605; Simon  I: 692–700; Afrahām b. Zurʿa: 975–78; and Murqus b. Zurʿa:
               1166–1189), while a fifth Syrian, the monk Samuel, was close to being elected in 1092
               (Den Heijer 2004). It is not uncommon in the colophons of Syr. mss. (mostly but not
               exclusively in those written in Egypt) as well as in Syr. inscriptions to find
               references to both the Syr. and the Coptic patriarch (Kaufhold). Monks of Syr. origin
               lived in various monasteries in Egypt, where they sometimes produced Syr.
               inscriptions, and collected or wrote Syr. mss. Some of these monasteries are
               explicitly mentioned in colophons of Syr. mss., such as the Monastery of Mar Michael,
               in Upper Egypt, where ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,582 was produced in 816; an unnamed
               monastery in the Thebais where in 822/23 the monk Ahron, from Dara, produced ms.
               Brit. Libr. Add. 14,623 (reusing a 6th-cent. ms. that contained <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>’s ‘Prose Refutations’); the Monastery of Mar Yonan, from where
               around the middle of the 9th cent. three monks brought 10 mss. (ms. Brit. Libr. Add.
               14,623 being one of them) to <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>; and the well-known
               Monastery of St. Paul, near the Red Sea, where ms. Brit. Libr. Or. 5021 was produced
               at the end of the 9th cent. (Brock 1995). The traditional historiographies of the
               Coptic and the Syr. Orth. Churches (in particular the Arabic ‘History of the
               Patriarchs of Alexandria’ and the Syr. Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael
               Rabo</ref>) pay much attention to developments in the sister church. Among the Syr.
               Orth. patriarchs with particular interest and contacts in Egypt, <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Quryaqos</ref> should be singled
               out. The Syr. Orth. never set up their own hierarchy in Egypt, even if they had some
               Syr. churches for their communities (Den Heijer 2004, 935–36).</p>
                    <p>A clear example of the proximity and the interaction between the two Churches is the
               creation and millennium-long existence of Dayr al-Suryān. After Syr. Orth. monks (in
               the first period mainly from <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref>) settled in the monastery in
               the second decade of the 9th cent., they lived together with Coptic monks. The
               inscriptions and wall paintings in the monastery clearly attest to the coexistence of
               the two communities, Syr. and Coptic, and from the 11th cent. onwards the scriptorium
               produced Coptic and Arabic mss. (along with the Syr. ones, which started being
               written in the monastery no later than the 10th cent.). While the status of the
               monastery between the Coptic and Syr. world has received much attention in recent
               scholarship, the disappearance of the Syr. element in the early 17th cent. should be
               seen rather as the gradual absorption of the Syr. monks into the mainstream of Coptic
               life than as a radical linguistic or cultural shift within the monastery’s population
               (Den Heijer 2004, 937).</p>
                    <p>While the Syrians’ familiarity with the main theologians of the Alexandrian tradition
               (such as <ref rend="bold">Athanasius</ref>, Cyril, <ref rend="bold">Timotheos</ref>, and
               Theodosius) and with the main texts of Egyptian asceticism was primarily based on
               Greek texts, there is some evidence of translation work from Coptic into Syriac. A
               Bohairic Coptic original underlies the extant Syriac Life of Macarius (Toda).
               Evidence of translation work carried out at the beginning of the 10th cent. by
               Yuḥanon bar Maqari, the abbot of Dayr al-Suryān, may be found in Syr. ms. Dayr
               al-Suryān 30. In this ms., partly written by <ref rend="bold">Mushe of Nisibis</ref>
               (the later abbot), Yuḥanon is credited with the translation ‘from the Egyptian tongue
               into Syriac’ of the Life of the Roman brothers Maximos and Dometios (unpublished) and
               of the Life of Macarius (ed. P. Bedjan, <hi rend="italic">Acta martyrum et
                  sanctorum</hi>, 5 [1895], 177–262). The same Yuḥanon left a note in Coptic in Syr.
               ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,635 (f. 5r), a ms. with extracts from <ref rend="bold">Evagrius
                  of Pontus</ref>, which he helped bind in 894, when he already was abbot. The Syr.
               impact on the Coptic liturgical tradition is significant. Many Syr. saints were
               adopted in the Coptic Church: in addition to Severus of Antioch, two major Syr.
               saints, <ref rend="bold">Barṣawmo</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>,
               are represented in the Coptic Synaxarium (Farag) and are depicted in Coptic art; many
               more are listed in Coptic martyrologia and liturgical calendars (Fiey 1972–1973,
               305–10). Some extracts from Ephrem and <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>are
               preserved in a dogmatic florilegium that may go back to Coptic sources, but is
               preserved only in Arabic and Ethiopic (Graf 1937). A number of translations from
               Syriac into Arabic were carried out in Egypt; some of them can be located in Dayr
               al-Suryān in the 15th–17th cent. (Graf 1951, 23).</p>
                    <p>While the present overview has focused on the Coptic contacts with the Syr. Orth.
               Church, E.-Syr. Christians traveled to Egypt as well, either as pilgrims and visitors
               (e.g., <ref rend="bold">Aba I</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Kashkar</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>) or for a longer stay. Around 700, an E.-Syr. bp. is
               attested for the E.-Syr. diaspora in Egypt, but shortly after his consecration he
               fell into the hands of Bedouins and was reduced to slavery for the remaining 40 years
               of his life. Other bps. are attested in the 10th and 11th cent. (Fiey 1972–1973,
               338–340). E.-Syr. authors who became popular in the Coptic Church include <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref>
               (‘the spiritual elder’), but their works were translated from Syriac directly into
               Arabic.</p>
                    <p>In the 19th cent. a Syr. Catholic hierarchy was set up in Cairo, while a Chaldean
               diocese, based in Heliopolis, was created in 1980. In the worldwide <ref rend="bold">Diaspora</ref> the Coptic and Syr. Orth. communities often work together. The
                  <ref rend="bold">British Orthodox Church</ref>, whose episcopal succession was
               partly Syr. Orth. in origin, was given a home in the Coptic Orth. Church in 1994.</p>
                    <p>A promising field of study may be the comparative study of the Coptic and Syriac
               language and syntax, as the two languages developed under similar conditions and were
               both exposed to the influence of Greek. Among the few features that have received
               some attention is the Syr. structure (occurring from the early 6th cent. onwards)
               consisting of the verb <hi rend="italic">ʿbad</hi> ‘to do’ followed by the Greek
               infinitive (e.g. <hi rend="italic">ʿbad filosofise</hi> ‘to philosophize’), which
               parallels, and may be derived from, a similar structure existing in all Coptic
               dialects except Sahidic, and which consists of the verbal form -<hi rend="italic">er</hi> ‘to do’ and a non-conjugated form of the Greek verb (e.g. Bohairic <hi rend="italic">er pisteuin</hi> ‘to believe’) (most recently Brock 2004 — for a
               different explanation, however, see C. A. Ciancaglini, ‘L’origine delle locuzioni
               verbali con <hi rend="italic">ʿbad</hi>in siriaco’, in <hi rend="italic">Loquentes

                <div type="body">
                    <p>The Crusades were a specific form of Holy War initiated by the pope. The canonical
               legitimacy of the Crusades was constituted by the papal convocation, the papal
               indulgences, and the vows taken by the participating knights. For the Syr. Christians
               the Crusades at the time had simultaneously positive and negative effects. In the
               long term the Crusades enhanced religious polarization and undermined the position of
               Christians in Muslim countries.</p>
                    <p>At the Council of Piacenza, in March 1095, the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos
               (1081–1118) requested Latin military aid against the expanding Muslim forces. With a
               view of restoring the union of the church and claiming for himself universal
               ecclesiastical authority, Pope Urban II (1088–99) began to campaign for a war aimed
               at liberating the Holy Places. He appealed to already existing conceptions of Holy
               War and developed them into a theory of an armed pilgrimage. At the Council of
               Clermont-Ferrand, in Nov. 1095, his idea of fighting a war for God met with immense
               religious enthusiasm. When the knights set out for <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> in
               1096, they were joined by pilgrims and ardent non-combatants of different origins.
               Pope Urban had ignited a formidable movement, which was difficult to control and
               which resulted in fundamental political, cultural, and economical changes in Europe
               and the Middle East.</p>
                    <p>Several vast military campaigns ensued, which were often led by the most powerful
               crowned heads of Europe. The Crusade of 1096 being the first, the next ones are
               traditionally counted as the Second Crusade (1145–1149), the Third Crusade (1187–92),
               the Fourth Crusade (1198–1204), the so-called Children’s Crusade of 1212, the Fifth
               Crusade (1217–1221), the Crusade of Frederick II (1228–1229) and the Crusades of King
               Louis  IX the Pious of France (1248–54, 1267–70). In addition, many more military
               campaigns with papal authorization were waged against Muslims between the 12th and
               the 15th cent. None of these, however, succeeded in bringing the expansion of the
               Turks to a halt, nor did they prevent the conquest of Constantinople in 1453. In
               Europe Crusades were waged against pagan peoples, against heretical movements, as
               well as against political enemies of the pope. The Reconquista on the Iberian
               Peninsula also became part of the Crusade movement. Even though criticism flared up
               against individual wars, the concept of Crusades as well as the ideal of the virtuous
               knightly Crusader remained strong.</p>
                    <p>Jerusalem was first captured in the year 1099. Against the wishes of the Byzantine
               emperor, who had expected the return of the re-conquered regions to his own rule,
               Latin Crusader States were established in the Levant as a result of the First Crusade
               (Kingdom of Jerusalem, County of Tripoli, Principality of Antioch, County of Edessa).
               The ruling French and Norman families by and large implemented the legal traditions
               of their homelands. Within the Crusader States all non-Latins were legally
               subordinated. On the local level traditional forms of autonomy and jurisdiction
               remained intact. The descendents of the first Crusaders developed a new
               Middle-Eastern identity and specific forms of relations to, as well as agreements
               with, Eastern Christians and Muslims. These Crusader States, although much reduced
               toward the coast, were sustained until the year 1291, which saw the fall of Acre.</p>
                    <p>As for the Christians, the discriminating poll tax under Muslim rule was lifted. The
               Greek Orthodox hierarchy was forced under the supremacy of a new Latin hierarchy
               built up in the Crusader states. Local Christians of the Greek Orthodox denomination
               are known as the ‘Suriani’ in the Latin sources. They made up a considerable part of
               the Christian population all over the Levant. Albeit speaking Arabic in daily use,
               they themselves cherished their Syrian or Aramean origin. Their liturgy was
               byzantinized during the Crusader period.</p>
                    <p>As the Syr. Orth. were considered heretical by the Latin Church, their hierarchy as
               well as the hierarchy of the Maronites on the whole was left intact. Almost all the
               areas of Maronite population fell under Latin rule in the County of Tripoli. Their
               patriarch resided in monasteries in the Maronite diocese of Jubail. Due to an extreme
               scarcity of sources, the history of the Maronites in this period is much disputed.
               The Latin chronicler William of Tyre regarded them as fine warriors and as allies of
               the Latins.</p>
                    <p>The Syr. Orth. archdioceses of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, Samosata, Manbij, Tarsus,
                  <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, and Jerusalem, as well as important bishoprics such
               as Acre, Tripoli, Cyprus, Marʿash, Raban, Kesoun, and Saruj became part of the
               Crusader states. In the County of Edessa the Syr. Orth. became involved in the Latin
               administration and also in military action. The capture of Edessa by the Zengid army
               in 1144 and the failed Latin attempt to regain the city caused much hardship among
               the Christian population. Massacres and slavery ended a short-lived period of pride
               and affluence. A spiritual crisis among the Syr. Orth. and theological debates flared
               up as a consequence.</p>
                    <p>The Ch. of E. came into contact with the Latins only on its periphery. Under the
               authority of the metropolitan of the Ch. of E. in <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref> and
               probably a second metropolitan of Jerusalem and Tripoli, members of this church lived
               also in Edessa, on Mount Lebanon, in Cyprus, in Antioch, and in the merchant towns on
               the sea coast. The communities were perhaps also enlarged by refugees, who had moved
               to the West during the Mongol invasions in Central Asia and Mesopotamia.</p>
                    <p>The intensity of theological relations between the Eastern Churches and the Latins
               depended on dogmatic positions as well as on their geographical dispersion and on
               political constellations. A general climate of theological openness led Eastern
               Christians and Latins in the 12th and 13th cent. to study each other’s theological
               propositions and also to seek common ground, with different outcomes. While the union
               between the Latin and the Greek Church still was officially upheld in the Levant,
               Latin ecclesiastical supremacy and conflicts alienated the two Churches. During the
               12th cent. almost no contacts between the Latins and the Ch. of E. are recorded. At
               the same time, the most isolated of the Syriac churches during that period, the
               Maronites, were officially united with the Roman Church. The Maronite patriarch
               Jeremiah II (1199–1230) was accepted as Primate of the Maronite Church and invited to
               the 4th Lateran Council in 1215. Some opposition against Latinization however flared
               up, most notably towards the end of the Latin rule in the Levant.</p>
                    <p>The Syr. Orth. Church sought a pragmatic understanding without giving up its
               independence, maintaining contact with the Latins and with the Byzantine Emperor
               Manuel. At the council of Jerusalem in 1141 the dogmatic differences between Latins,
               Armenians, and Syr. Orth. were not felt as grave as previously expected. Joint
               religious practice as well as theological disputations took place. The Syr. Orth.
               used the advantages of a government that was often unfavorable to the Greek Orthodox.
               In turn, several instances of direct church governance by the Latins can be detected
               in which the Latin authorities overruled internal decisions by the Syr. Orth.
               patriarchs or synods.</p>
                    <p>During the 13th cent. the Pope intensified his diplomatic and missionary efforts
               among the Ch. of E. and the Syr. Orth. Church. The generally tolerant attitude of the
               Mongols towards Christians raised Latin hopes for new allies against the Muslims. The
               residences of the mendicants in the Crusader States served as bridgeheads for the
               missions, while the local Latin Church seems to have been little involved. Individual
               prelates of the Syr. Orth. Church and the Ch. of E. maintained close relations with
               the Latins. No Syr. source, however, corroborates Roman claims that some Syrian
               metropolitans or patriarchs recognized Roman primacy at that time. Such claims could
               be due to a misunderstanding of the Syrian attitudes. Such unions were in any case
               ephemeral and not supported by the communities.</p>
                    <p>The frequent wars, their economical effects on local trade and agriculture, roaming
               bandits, and encroachments on the Eastern Christians caused hardship. Refugees fled
               to the coast especially after the final Muslim conquest of Edessa in 1146. A slow
               deterioration of the relations between the Christian and Muslim population is
               noticeable. Neither Muslims nor Latins sufficiently secured the indigenous
               population. At the same time for Syriac Christians this was a period of most
               important achievements in all fields of art and culture, for which the term ‘<ref rend="bold">Syriac Renaissance</ref>’ has been often used (see in particular Kawerau
               1960 and Teule et al., 2010).</p>

                    <p>Syriac (and Arabic) scholar. After a period (1834–7) as a sub-librarian in the
               Bodleian Library, Oxford, he became Assistant Keeper of Manuscripts in the British
               Museum, where he was in charge of cataloguing Arabic mss. The acquisition, in the

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> and Greek Church Father. Cyril became bp. ca.
               349, but was exiled on various occasions for his opposition to Arianism. Only
               excerpts from his main work, the Catechetical Homilies, survive in Syriac
               translation. (Fragments of a complete translation are preserved in <ref rend="bold">Christian Palestinian Aramaic</ref>, ed. C. Müller-Kessler and M. Sokoloff,
               1999).</p>
                    <p>Three extracts from the Mystagogical Catecheses (IV.1, 2, 4) are given in the Syr.
               Catholic <hi rend="italic">Fenqitho</hi> (VI., 371–2. 273–4, 376–7) for Corpus
               Christi.</p>
                    <p>Syriac translations of two letters are preserved: 1. on the vision of the Cross, ed.
               with ET, J. F. Coakley, in <hi rend="italic">AB</hi> 102 (1984), 71–84; and 2. on the
               attempted rebuilding of the Temple in 363, ed. with ET, S. P. Brock, in <hi rend="italic">BSOAS</hi> 40 (1977), 267–86 (repr. in <hi rend="italic">Syriac
                  Perspectives on Late Antiquity</hi> [1984], ch .X). The second letter probably
               dates from after Cyril’s death (though Wainwright considers it genuine); its list of
               towns affected by the earthquake of 363 has proved important for Palestinian
               archaeology of that period.</p>
                    <p>A series of short hymns for Good Friday are found in four medieval mss., two of which
               attribute them to Cyril of Jerusalem (ed. A. Baumstark, in <hi rend="italic">OC</hi>
               III.4 [1930], 232–47); they are also extant in Greek (where they are attributed to
                  <ref rend="bold">Sophronius</ref> of Jerusalem [d. 638], or <ref rend="bold">Cyril of
                  Alexandria</ref>, or anonymous), and in Georgian (anonymous).</p>
                    <p>For the Anaphora of Cyril, see under Cyril of Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>His commemoration is given as either 17 or 18 March.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> and Cath, also known as ‘Dadishoʿ the
               Aramean’. Our main source for Dadishoʿ’s life and work is the report of the Synod of
               the Ch. of E. held in 424, which is included in the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon
                  Orientale</ref>. In spite of the inauguration of a policy of toleration and
               freedom for the Church in the Persian Empire under Yazdgard I (r. 399–420), reflected
               most clearly in the Synod of <ref rend="bold">Iṣḥaq</ref> (410), the situation of the
               Christians again deteriorated towards the end of Yazdgard’s rule, when warfare
               between the Roman and Persian Empires resumed. After some difficult years, Dadishoʿ
               was elected Cath. in 421 or 422. From the beginning he was confronted with opposition
               and accusations within the Church. Imprisoned by the Persian authorities, he was
               released only after the intervention of a ‘believing envoy’ (apparently from the
               Roman Empire). This is the background to the Synod of 424, held not in the capital
               but in ‘Markabta of the Arabs’. Dadishoʿ is quoted at length in the account of the
               Synod: he reports about his painful experience and is reluctant to resume leadership.
               The gathered bishops, with bp. Agapetos of <ref rend="bold">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>and Hoshaʿ
               of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> as their main spokesmen, supplicate Dadishoʿ to come
               back and promise him their full support. He finally consents. His tenure is said to
               have lasted for 35 years, until his death, but following the Synod of 424 no further
               information on him is preserved.</p>
                    <p>A remarkable moment in the Synod is the participating bishops’ decision to abolish
               what they see as the right of Eastern Christians to lodge complaints against the bp.
               of Seleucia-Ctesiphon with Western bishops (i.e. bishops within the Roman Empire).
               Although no such right is recorded in any preserved text, its abolition is presented
               as a step toward Dadishoʿ’s full rehabilitation. In recent scholarship, this
               abolition has sometimes been interpreted as a declaration of independence of the Ch.
               of E. Such an interpretation, however, is based on the assumption that in the
               earliest period the Ch. of E. was subjected to the authority of the Church within the
               Roman Empire (or of the bp. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>), whereas such dependence
               in all likelihood never existed. It remains uncertain, therefore, whether the Synod
               of 424 and Dadishoʿ’s tenure in fact contributed to the process of alienation between
               the Syriac Christian communities in the two Empires, which took place in the course
               of the 5th cent.</p>

                    <p>Syriac Darmsuq and Arabic Dimashq. City in Syria and the seat at present of the Syr.
               Orth. Patriarchate. Damascus, situated at the eastern edge of the Syrian Desert at
               the foot of Mt. Qāsiyūn and watered by the Baradā, has been continuously inhabited at
               least since the 4th millennium BC and was in 13th–8th centuries BC the seat of an
               Aramean kingdom. Damascus came under Roman control in 64 BC. Taken by the Arabs in
               635, Damascus became the capital of the new empire under the Umayyads. In later
               periods, Damascus was the most important city in the Bilād al-Shām, an area covering
               what is today the southern part of Syria, as well as Lebanon, Palestine, and Jordan.
               Under Ottoman rule (1516–1918), Damascus was the capital of the province of al-Shām.
               Damascus is today the capital of the Syrian Arab Republic, with a population of ca.
               1.6 million (2.7 million in the conurbation, in 2008).</p>
                    <p>Damascus already had followers of Christ at the time of the conversion of St. Paul.
               Early Miaphysite bishops of Damascus were Mammianus (512–518) and Thomas, the latter
               exiled under Emperor Justin I in 519. The Maronite chronicle of 664 tells us of two
               Syr. Orth. bishops Theodoros and Sebokht (i.e. <ref rend="bold">Severos Sebokht</ref>)
               losing in a disputation with the Maronites before the first Umayyad caliph Muʿāwiyya
               I in Damascus in 659. Bp. Ḥenanyo<ref rend="bold"/>of Damascus was present at the Syr.
               Orth. Synod of <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref> in 684. We know the names of a more or
               less continuous series of Syr. Orth. bishops of Damascus from the beginning of the
               9th cent. In 1211, we hear of Bp. Yuḥanon of Damascus serving as an envoy from Patr.
               Yuḥanon XI (1207/15–20) to the Coptic Pope John VI (1189–1216). In the middle of the
               15th cent., the Syr. Orth. see of Damascus is found united with that of <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>. Gregory (Cyril) ʿAṭāʾ Allāh, whose activities in India
               triggered the Coonan Cross Oath of 1653 (see <ref rend="bold">Thomas Christians</ref>),
               was Syr. Orth. Metr. of Damascus and <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref> before his conversion
               to Catholicism in 1631. In the latter half of the 17th cent. Damascus was the scene
               of some lively scribal activity centerd around the school of bp. Grigorios Yūḥannā b.
               al-Ghurayr al-Zurbābī (bp. 1668–84), himself copyist and translator into Arabic of
                  <ref rend="bold">Daniel of Ṣalaḥ</ref>’s commentary on the Psalms and, together with
               his son Sergios, of several works of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>. Among the Syr.
               Orth. bishops of Damascus in the next century was Grigorios Yūḥannā Niʿmat Allāh
               al-Ṣadadī (1754–82), the translator of the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael I
                  Rabo</ref> into Arabic in 1759.</p>
                    <p>The Syr. Orth. patriarchate was transferred from Ḥimṣ to Damascus in 1959 under Patr.
                  <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Yaʿqub  III</ref> (1957–80), who had previously been metr.
               of <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref> and Damascus since 1950. The Monastery of St. Ephrem
               in Maʿarrat Ṣaydnāyā (approx. 35 km. north of Damascus), where the Patriarch now
               usually resides, was opened in 1996.</p>
                    <p>The Syr. Catholic community in Damascus, which began to gain in numbers towards the
               end of the 18th cent., has had the future patriarch Shemʿun Zora (Patr. 1814–18) and
               the scholar <ref rend="bold">Clemens Joseph David</ref> (Metr. 1879–90) among its
               bishops.</p>
                    <p>The E.-Syr. see of Damascus was erected as a diaspora see in 630. It was made a
               metropolitan see by <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref> at the end of the 8th cent. and
               is reported to have had <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>, Jerusalem, and Egypt as its
               suffragans in 1007/8. It is last heard of at the end of the 11th cent.</p>
                    <p>Fifteen churches were left to the Christians in Damascus after the Arab conquest,
               among them a ‘Jacobite church’ and a ‘church of the ʿIbād’, i.e. E. Syr. By the time
               Ibn ʿAsākir (d. 1175) wrote his ‘History of Damascus’, the original ‘Jacobite’
               church, located in the southwestern part of the city, was in ruins, the two churches
               of the ʿIbād that he knew of, both to the east of the Umayyad Mosque, had been
               converted into mosques, and only two churches were in use, that of St. Mary (<hi rend="italic">Maryamiyya</hi>, present Rum Orth. cathedral) and that being used by
               the Syr. Orth., located to the west of Bāb Tūmā. At the latest from the 17th cent.
               onwards, Mar<ref rend="bold"/>Behnam is mentioned as the patron of the W. Syr. church
               in Damascus.</p>
                    <p>Damascus is today the residence of Syr. Orth., Melk. Orth. and Melk. Catholic
               patriarchs, as well as of Syr. Catholic and Maron. archbishops and an Armenian
               Catholic patriarchal vicar. The Melk. Orthodox constitute the largest Christian group
               in Damascus, followed by the Melk. Catholics. For the Syriacs, the reported numbers
               of the faithful in the respective dioceses for Damascus are: Syr. Orth. 25,000 (in
               2003), Syr. Catholic 8,000 (in 2006), Maron. 12,000 (in 2006). The area around Bāb
               Tūmā in the northeastern part of the old city has been the traditional Christian
               Quarter of Damascus. The Syr. Orth. Patriarchate, with the cathedral church of St.
               George, is located on the southern part of Bāb Tūmā Street. (There is an older Syr.
               Orth. chapel of St. George further east, on the north-south street leading to the
               ‘House of Ananias’). The Maron. cathedral (‘Assumption’ <hi rend="italic">Sayyidat
                  al-intiqāl</hi>, also St. Antony) is found just to the north of the Syr. Orth.
               Patriarchate, while the Syr. Catholic cathedral (St. Paul) lies further south, next
               to the Melk. Catholic Patriarchate, near Bāb Sharqī.</p>

                    <p>Monk, assistant of the general superior of the monastic congregation of Rabban
               Hormizd, E.-Syr. writer and poet. When the Chald. Patr. Nicholas I Zayʿa resigned in
               1846, Damyanos took the lead of the party who resented the new Patr. Yawsep Audo.
               With Turkish support, he was chosen as regent of the Patriarchate, but a French
               diplomatic intervention led the Sublime Porte to confirm Yawsep Audo as Chald. Patr.
               Damyanos decided to leave the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Rabban Hormizd</ref> and
               retired to his native <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref> as a simple priest.</p>
                    <p>Damyanos wrote in Classical Syriac two hymns On the Immaculate Conception and a poem
               On a Kurdish Attack against Alqosh in 1832. In 1857 he translated the famous Latin
               hymn <hi rend="italic">Stabat mater</hi> from Arabic to <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref>.
               He is also the author of a Classical Syriac translation of the <hi rend="italic">Muršid al-Kahana</hi>, an Arabic adaptation of a baroque handbook for preachers
               by Paolo Segneri, SJ (1624–1694). Among his poems belonging to the <ref rend="bold">dorekthā</ref>-genre, the poetic diptych On the Torments of Hell and On the
               Delights of the Kingdom shows to what extent he assimilated doctrine, spirituality,
               and rhetorical schemes of Italian baroque sermons by Segneri and Giovan Pietro
               Pinamonti, SJ (1632–1703).</p>

                    <p>Author of an ‘Ecclesiastical history’. He was a contemporary of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> (d. 659). His work does not survive, but various authors
               refer to it, in particular <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Gewargis of Arbela</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> (in
               his commentary on John). In addition, it is explicitly quoted 5 times in the Arabic
               Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref>, which has led scholars to suggest that it
               was used as a direct source by the Chronicler (along with two other 7th-cent.
               historians whose works have not been preserved, Eliya of Merv and Bar Sahde).
               Daniel’s Ecclesiastical History is mentioned by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar

                    <p>Bp. of Taḥal (in <ref rend="bold">Beth Garmai</ref>). <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar
                  Brikha</ref> attributes several works to him: a ‘Book of flowers’ (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-habbābe</hi>, possibly an anthology of poetry), funeral
               sermons, metrical homilies, questions and answers on the text of Scripture, various
               riddles, a treatise related to the fifth volume of <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of
                  Nineveh</ref> (even though the attribution of a fifth volume to Isḥaq is
               problematic, see S. Chialà, <hi rend="italic">Dall’ ascesi</hi>, 71–3), and a
               commentary on <hi rend="italic">reše d-idaʿtā</hi> ‘Kephalaia gnostica’ (?). None of
               these works survive. Of his work on Isḥaq of Niniveh (in which apparently he voiced
               some criticism of Isḥaq) echoes can be heard in the later tradition, and it was known
               to <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>. The existence of this work seems to suggest that
               Daniel lived around, or shortly after, the time of Isḥaq, possibly in the 7th cent.
               Moreover, Daniel bar Ṭubanitha, with his full name, is mentioned a number of times in
               the later exegetical tradition, in particular in <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of
                  Merv</ref>’s biblical commentaries, even though no title of a specific work is
               ever provided.</p>
                    <p>The question arises whether Daniel bar Ṭubanitha might be the same person as <ref rend="bold">Daniel bar Maryam</ref> — <hi rend="italic">Ṭubanitha</hi> ‘the blessed
               one’ serving as a synonym for Maryam, the Virgin Mary. This identification, which was
               first suggested by Chabot, certainly deserves to be considered, but one would have to
               go against the evidence provided by Ishoʿdad and ʿAbdishoʿ who, as Degen pointed out,
               clearly saw two distinct Daniels.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Author. His father’s name was ʿĪsā. He studied at the Monastery of Noṭpo (outside
                  <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>) where he was ordained priest. In 1356 he went to
               Egypt and spent 17 years there. Most of his writings were in Arabic; these include a
               summary of Syr. Orth. canon law under 17 headings (listed in Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi> II, 463), resumés of various works by <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref>, and two theological works; he was also the copyist of some of Bar
                  ʿEbroyo’s works (Takahashi, 491). His only surviving work in
               Syriac is an account of how he was interrogated and tortured in March 1382 by the
               ruler of Mardin, Malik al-Ṭāhir and his vizier, after a book in which he had
               criticised other religions had fallen into the wrong hands and he was denounced to
               the authorities. The work survives in an autograph (Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 244, ed.
               Nau) and in Mingana Syr. 306. His Arabic works sometimes give the author’s name as
               ‘Daniel ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (or al-Ḥaṭṭāb in Mingana ms. Chr. Ar. 100) of Mardin’; this is
               usually thought to be a confusion with the Daniel bar Ḥaṭṭāb to whom <ref rend="bold">Khamis bar Qardaḥe</ref> addressed a question incorporated into a poem by Bar
                  ʿEbroyo (A. Scebabi, <hi rend="italic">Gregorii Hebraei
                  Carmina</hi>[1877], 153–4), whence it has been deduced that Daniel bar Khaṭṭāb was
               a younger contemporary of Bar ʿEbroyo. This assumes that the
               question and answer are not (as would seem more likely) a later interpolation. Since
               Khamis’s dates are equally uncertain, it is possible that only a single bar Ḥaṭṭāb is
               involved; if this is the case, then Daniel bar Ḥaṭṭāb of Mardin provides a
               14th-century date for Khamis, rather than 13th. Daniel of Mardin should be
               distinguished from the ‘Malphono Daniel’ known from an Esṭrangela epitaph probably
               dated 1172/3, published by J. Jarry (‘Un écrivain syriaque inconnu du Tur ‘Abdin’,

                <ab type="infobox">(fl. mid-6th cent.) [Syr. Orth.]</ab>
                <div type="body">
                    <p>Biblical exegete, theologian, abbot and possibly bp. Although he is one of the most
               influential Syr. Orth. writers, none of Daniel’s writings have been fully edited, and
               the little that is known about his life is almost entirely dependent upon these
               texts. In a homily (on Ps. 83) in the middle of his best known work, and the only one
               at present thought to have been preserved in its entirety, his ‘Great Commentary on
               the Psalms’, he gives the current date as year of the Greeks 853, i.e. AD 542. Since
               J. S. Assemani erroneously identified him with a Daniel known to have corresponded
               with <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> in the 8th cent., it should be emphasised
               that a 6th-cent. date is confirmed by Daniel’s theological concerns, his references
               to contemporary historical events (such as the incursions and raids of the Blemmyes,
               Sabirai, and Antai), and by the prefixed correspondence in which Daniel is requested
               to write the commentary by Abbot Yuḥanon of the monastery of Mor Eusebios of Kaprā
               d-Bartā (or d-Birtā) northwest of <ref rend="bold">Apamea</ref> (the modern twin
               villages of Kefr and Bara). Abbot Yuḥanon is listed in the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> (IX.14) amongst those condemned for their opposition
               to Chalcedon by the emperor Justinian. It appears to be the same Yuḥanon (described
               as ‘a wall against wolves’) for whom a copy of the Acts of the Second Council of
               Ephesus was produced by one of his monks in 535 (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add.
               14,530). By 567, however, Yuḥanon had disappeared from the scene, for one Qustantinos
               is listed as abbot of this important monastery.</p>
                    <p>Assemani also linked Daniel with the village of Ṣalaḥ in <ref rend="bold">Ṭur
                  ʿAbdin</ref> (southeast Turkey), and this has been followed by all subsequent
               western scholars. In the present Syr. Orth. monastery of Ṣalaḥ, however, this
               prestigious connection is rejected, as also by the Syr. Orth. scholar and Patr.
               Ignatius Afram Barsoum who instead links Daniel to Ṣaliḥiye (near modern Abū Kāmāl in
               Syria) on the left bank of the Euphrates just south of ancient <ref rend="bold">Dura-Europos</ref>. Some support for this can be found in the Chronicle of
               Michael who describes him as Abbot Daniel of Bayt Ṣaliḥe (IX.34), although the exact
               name and location of his monastery is not given. Later tradition also links Daniel
               with Tella d-Mawzelat (ancient Constantina, modern Viranşehir south-west of
               Diyarbakır, Turkey), although in some sources he is said to have been born there and
               in others to have become its bishop, as a successor to the famous <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Tella</ref> (d. 538). Although Daniel was certainly a leading figure
               in the anti-Chalcedonian party he is not listed amongst those bps. ordained by <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref>, and neither has any later reference to his
               episcopacy yet been found in any source other than the mss. of his Psalm
               Commentary.</p>
                    <p>Daniel’s Psalm Commentary is a vast work of erudition and spirituality, and appears
               to be the oldest known psalm commentary composed in Syriac. It runs to more than
               1,000 ms. pages and is divided into three volumes each containing fifty psalms.
               Although it was long thought by western scholars to have been only partially
               preserved, it has in fact continued to be read and studied in the Syr. Orth. church
               to the present day, and so their complete mss. now make a critical edition of this
               important work possible.</p>
                    <p>The commentary acts as a great storehouse of Syr. Orth. exegetical traditions and
               theology and preserves both ideas known from earlier Syrian writers such as <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, but also many others
               previously unknown. It does not appear to be dependent on any previous commentary,
               although there is evidence that Daniel knew Greek and even had some access to Hebrew
               texts and traditions. As with Ephrem’s commentary on the <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref> no attempt is made to expound every line or word of the Psalms,
               but only those which attract the author’s attention. The exegesis is also structured
               in the form of self-contained homilies, which makes them suitable for either private
               or communal reading — in contrast, for example, with the technical, philological
               commentary of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>. Although Daniel often attempts to
               identify the historical occasions of the Psalms’ composition, he usually moves
               quickly on to expound their spirit-inspired references to the divine dispensation
               personified in Emmanuel, God the Word. He regularly engages with christological
               issues, and he is especially concerned to counter the teachings of <ref rend="bold">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref> and his followers, often known as the
               ‘Phantasiasts’ or ‘Aphthartodocetae’, which were creating bitter dissension in his
               age within both Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian parties. He clearly developed a
               reputation for expertise in this area since his letter to the monks of the monastery
               of Mar Bassus on the subject formed the basis of the official Syr. Orth. response to
               the edict of Emperor Justinian, issued in 565, that ‘all bishops everywhere’ should
               accept Julianism (Michael’s Chronicle, IX.34), and this may have been one of the key
               reasons that Abbot Yuḥanon requested him to write this commentary.</p>
                    <p>Its great size has led to at least four major attempts to reduce it to a manageable
               format; the best known of these is an edition (produced before 1515) of approximately
               250 pages which is usually described as the commentary of ‘Daniel (or David) of
               Tella’, and which also includes some material and interpretation not found in the
               original work, and to this can be added a collection of short extracts, plus editions
               by Patr. Ignatius V (<ref rend="bold">Behnam Ḥadloyo</ref>, d. 1454) and by <ref rend="bold">Dawid Puniqoyo</ref> (d. 1500), none of which has yet been published. It
               is also cited by the monk <ref rend="bold">Severos</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Anṭun of
                  Tagrit</ref>, and Bar ʿEbroyo, and was one of the major sources for the psalm
               commentary of <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>. An important Armenian
               translation was commissioned by Catholicos Grigor Vkayaser in the late 11th cent.,
               and an Arabic version was made in 1730 by ʿAbd al-Nūr Amīdī.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the Great Psalm Commentary, and the letter written to the monks of Mar
               Bassus (elements of which may survive in the large unedited collections of
               anti-Julianist material still preserved in the mss. of the British Library and the
               Vatican), citations of a commentary on Qohelet (Ecclesiastes) have also been
               preserved, and Daniel himself (in his homily on Ps. 78) refers to an earlier homily

               Trichur in Kerala, built a seminary, and saw through the press an edition of the <hi rend="italic">Ḥudrā</hi> (1960–2). In 1963 he published an attack on the
               hereditary patriarchate, and was suspended by Mar Shemʿun the next year. The
               suspension was overturned in the courts, but a bitter schism ensued between the
               Darmoists and the Patr.’s supporters. In 1968 Mar Toma Darmo was summoned by the
               anti-patriarchal party in Iraq. A synod deposed Mar Shemʿun and Mar Thoma was
               consecrated Patr. with the government’s blessing. He died in office less than a year

               within the Syr. Churches of the late 19th cent. Born in ʿAmadiyya, he studied in Rome from 1846–55, before returning to <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>. He returned to Rome 1869–70, serving as an Oriental Consultant
               during the First Vatican Council, and in 1888 he played an important role at the
               Synod of <ref rend="bold">Sharfeh</ref>. He was closely involved in preparing the

               of Hebrew (previously he had also worked on a new edition of the Bible in Arabic).
               Among the most important of his many publications is his Syriac Grammar (Mosul, 1879;
               2nd ed. 1896 in 2 vols.). His last years were largely devoted to preparing the

                    <p>Author. Born in Beth Shahaq, in the region of <ref rend="bold">Nineveh</ref>, he was
               abbot of the monastery of Mor Sargis, on the Dry Mountain in Sinjar. A marginal note
               to Dolabani no. 2, states that in 785 (cf. Mingana Syr. 29 for the year) he
               temporarily moved with others to a monastery on the Euphrates (evidently <ref rend="bold">Qenneshre</ref>) and later brought back 170 <hi rend="italic">maʿnyoto</hi> of <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref>, adapting them for liturgical use
               in the east. The texts published by Dolabani are mainly letters, prose, and verse, in
               a learned style, to named correspondents; of particular interest are no.  6, on the
               authorship of Wisdom (Maccabean date), and no. 14 (LT in Rahmani, 44–6), on points in
               biblical mss., with reference to several scholars. At the end are two longer poems,
               on the 7 <hi rend="italic">klimata</hi> (also ed. by Cardahi and Gottheil from
               different mss), and one on the trees and plants and their symbolism (the first part
               is given in <hi rend="italic">Qolo Suryoyo</hi> 56 [1987], 153–49). He is also author
               of some short grammatical works (partial ed. Gottheil), a poem on the alphabet (ed.
               Gottheil), a commentary on Genesis 10 (in ms. British Libr. Add. 14,620; incomplete)
               and a dialogue with a Melkite on the Trisagion (excerpt in <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, vol. 1, 518–9). The attribution to him of the 22 short poems (forming
               an alphabetic acrostic) published by Qarabashi cannot be correct: each poem contains
               only a single example of its opening letter, a type of composition, as Barsoum points
               out, which does not otherwise appear till the 13th cent.</p>

                    <p>Priest, author, and poet. Based on ms. colophons and an extant correspondence with
                  Patr. <ref rend="bold">Nuḥ the Lebanese</ref>, it is known that Dawid lived in the
               latter half of the 15th cent. According to traditional biographical sources, he was
               born Dawid b. ʿAbd al-Karīm b. Ṣalāḥ in al-Qaryatayn in 1431. At a young age, he
               moved to <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref>, from which his sobriquet Puniqoyo (= of Ḥimṣ)
               derives. He became a monk and later a deacon at <ref rend="bold">Dayr Mār Mūsā
                  al-Ḥabashī</ref>. In 1459, he went to <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> where
               he was ordained a priest. He then proceeded to <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Ṣalīb</ref> and
               in 1481 traveled to Constantinople. Dawid is one of the most prominent Syriac authors
               of the 15th cent. His prose works include an autobiography up to the middle of his
               life and a biographical piece on <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref>. In
               addition, he wrote a commentary on Psalms that incorporates material from various
               commentaries, especially those by <ref rend="bold">Daniel of Ṣalaḥ</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>. Dawid
               also composed a number of poetic works, some of which employ rhyme and/or are
               acrostics. These include <hi rend="italic">mimre</hi>entitled ‘On Repentance’, ‘On
               Spiritual Life’, and ‘On the Afflictions of Exile’ (ed. with ET Butts). In addition
               to <hi rend="italic">mimre</hi>, he wrote a <hi rend="italic">sedro</hi>on
               resurrection and a number of liturgical poems. Despite his prolific literary
               activity, most of the works by Dawid remain unedited.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Jewish Italian physician; biblical scholar and polymath; author of a treatise about
               the usefulness of the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> for the evaluation of the Vulgate
               of the NT. Little is known about his childhood and early education. After leaving his
               birth town, Mantua, he wandered to several Italian cities, living for some time in
               Ferrara, Ancona, Bologna, and Sabbioneta. His best known work, <hi rend="italic">Meʾor ʿenayim</hi> (‘Light of the Eyes’, Mantua, 1573), incited controversy among
               Jewish scholars, especially because of its critique of the historical reliability of
               the Talmud, but it earned him the appreciation of several Christian Hebraists. Ill,
               impoverished, and ostracized by many of his fellow Rabbis, De’ Rossi began to attempt
               to appeal to a Christian audience. His <hi rend="italic">Osservazioni di Buonaiuto
                  de’ Rossi ebreo sopra diversi luoghi degli Evangelisti novamente esposti secondo
                  la vera lezione siriaca</hi> (‘Observations of Bonaiuto de’ Rossi the Jew
               regarding various passages in the Gospels expounded anew according to the true Syriac
               reading’), written in Italian, is dedicated to Giacomo Boncompagni, Captain General
               of the Catholic Church, and opens with a letter to cardinal Giulio Antonio Santoro,
               head of the Collegio dei Neofiti and a figure much involved in the attempts at
               achieving the ‘reunification’ with the Churches of the East (he supervised the
               translation of the Syr. Orth. missal). The book, composed in Ferrara between 1575 and
               1577, must be read against the backdrop of the debate about the trustworthiness of
               the Vulgate that had followed the declaration of its authenticity on the part of the
               Council of Trent (1546). In this work, De’ Rossi set out to show that, thanks to its
               superiority, the NT Peshitta (published for the first time by Johann Albrecht
               Widmanstetter and <ref rend="bold">Mushe of Mardin</ref> in 1555) could shed light upon
               corrupt or obscure passages of the NT Vulgate, especially those in which Aramaic
               expressions appear. In order to prove his point De’ Rossi expounded seventeen
               passages from the Gospels containing Aramaic words, citing each passage first in the
               Latin version of the Vulgate; then in Syriac (in Serṭo script and in cursive Hebrew
               and Latin transcription); and finally in his own Italian translation. De’ Rossi
               employed <ref rend="bold">Teseo Ambrogio degli Albonesi</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Introductio</hi> as his main tool for learning Syriac, which like many of his
               contemporaries he considered just a different alphabet for writing Aramaic, but he
               also seems to have made use of Widmanstetter’s <hi rend="italic">Elementa</hi>.</p>

                    <p>Author of a commentary on the Psalms. On the basis of remarks by <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref>, Wright and Baumstark identify Denḥa as a disciple of
                  <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref>, placing him in the first half of the 9th cent.
               His only extant work is a commentary on the Psalms, which along with the commentary
               by <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> is an important witness to E.-Syr.
               interpretation of the Psalms. The earliest ms. of the commentary, Paris Bib. Nat.
               Syr. 367 (dated 1252; formerly Siirt 29), identifies two authors: ‘Rabban Denḥa, but
               others say Rabban Grigor, monk of Gamre.’ This double attribution, found in all the
               extant mss., seems to refer to a new edition of Denḥa’s commentary by the monk Grigor
               of Gamre, who is otherwise unknown, with the additions having been made in red ink.
               Van Rompay has shown that the Denḥa-Grigor commentary is in fact an expanded form of
               the anonymous Psalm commentary found in ms. Sachau 215 (dated 1882), both
               commentaries preserving elements of the exegesis of the Psalms by <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. The Denḥa-Grigor commentary was supplemented by
               material ascribed to <ref rend="bold">Aḥob Qaṭraya</ref> and has been preserved in mss.
               that incorporate, in whole or in part, other works on the Psalms, notably a Book on
               the Cause of the Psalms of Mar Aḥob Qaṭraya, an introduction to the Psalms by <ref rend="bold">Nathniel of Sirzor</ref> (ca. 600), and one of Ishoʿ bar Nun’s ‘Selected
               Questions’ (dealing with Ps. 119). The commentary appears to have been popular in the
               E.-Syr. tradition and is found in a number of 19th-cent. mss. (e.g., ms. Mingana Syr.
               58 and ms. Cambridge Univ. Libr. Or. 1318). Echoes of the Denḥa-Grigor commentary are
               found in W.-Syr. commentaries on the Psalms by <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar
                  Ṣalibi</ref> (factual commentary) and <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>. A  few
               extracts of the Denḥa-Grigor commentary dealing with messianism have been published
               by Vandenhoff.</p>

               in Kerala in 1558 — by Chald. bishops. At the same time, the second half of the 16th
               cent. had seen an increase in the activities of Latin missionaries in Kerala and
               moves by the Portuguese to strengthen their control over the Thomas Christians, who
               were indispensable for them as partners in the spice trade, with the result, for
               example, that the Chald. bp. Mar Abraham, who had arrived in India in 1568, was
               summoned in 1585 to attend the Third Provincial Council of Goa and was made to agree
               to the introduction of a number of Latin practices in the liturgy of the Thomas
               Christians.</p>
                    <p>Following the death of Mar Abraham in 1597, Archbishop Aleixo (Alexis) de Menezes of
               Goa (1559–1617, Archbishop of Goa 1595–1612) arrived in Kerala in Jan. 1599. After
               gaining the support of the local rulers and some of the local clergy, partly by
               ordaining a large number of new priests, and forcing Archdeacon George of the Cross
               (archdeacon 1594–1640), the leader of the Thomas Christians, to submit to him,
               Menezes called for a synod to be convened in June 1599. Udayamperur, more easily
               accessible from the Portuguese stronghold at Kochi than the traditional center of the
               diocese at Angamali, was chosen as the venue of the synod.</p>
                    <p>The synod, attended by 153 local priests and 660 lay representatives, lasted from the
               20th to the 27th of June, and passed more than 200 decrees in rapid succession and
               evidently without any serious debate. The decrees covering doctrinal, liturgical, and
               customary matters were designed to bring the Church of the Thomas Christians in line
               with the post-Tridentine Roman Church, as well as to sever her links with the E.-Syr.
               (Chald.) Church, and included condemnations of ‘Nestorian’ heresy and prohibition of
               any recognition of the ‘Patriarch of Babylon’.</p>
                    <p>The Jesuit Francisco Ros (Roz), writing in 1604, reported that Menezes had altered
               the text of the acts and decrees of the synod which he sent to Rome after the synod
               had ended, and there are indeed significant differences between the Malayalam text of
               the decrees and the text which was made known in Europe, although we cannot be sure
               that the Malayalam text we have today, preserved only in 18th-cent. mss., faithfully
               represents the decrees as read out and passed at the synod. Serious doubts have also
               been cast on the canonical validity of the synod itself by scholars including J.
               Thaliath. Valid or not, however, the synod and its decrees, the latter somewhat
               modified at the diocesan synod of 1603 and by the so-called Rozian Statutes of 1606,
               were to determine the way of life and the course of events for the Thomas Christians,
               especially those who remained in communion with Rome, in the subsequent
               centuries.</p>
                    <p>After the synod, Menezes remained in Kerala until Nov. 1599 and made a tour of the
               diocese, during which books preserved in the local churches were submitted to his
               entourage for examination and those deemed heretical were consigned to the flame. It
               is believed that a large proportion of those Syriac mss. which were in Kerala at the
               time were lost in this way, although it is difficult now to determine the exact
               extent of the loss.</p>
                    <p>In Dec. 1599, Ros was appointed new bp. of the diocese of Angamali, which was now
               formally placed under the Portuguese Padroado and made suffragan to the archdiocese
               of Goa, although it regained its archiepiscopal status in name in 1608 (the see was
               transferred around the same time to Kodungallur/Cranganore). Ros was followed by a
               succession of Jesuit archbishops. The dissatisfaction of the Thomas Christians with
               their rule was to lead to the revolt against them at the Coonan Cross Oath of 1653
               and the subsequent division of the Thomas Christians between those who remained in
               communion with Rome and those who turned to the Syr. Orth. Church.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Prior to the late 19th cent. there had been very little emigration from the Middle
               East, whereas today there are more Christians from the Syriac (and other Middle
               Eastern) Churches living in the Diaspora than remain in the homelands. The two main
               causes of this massive demographic change are 1. the massacres in Syria and Lebanon
               of 1860, and especially those in Eastern Turkey of 1895/6 and of 1915 (see <ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref>) and following years; and 2. the continuing unsettled
               political situation, involving wars and civil strife, in many countries of the Middle
               East, where certain events in particular have given rise to renewed waves of
               emigration, notably in 1933 after the end of the British Mandate in Iraq (1932),
               involving the Assyrians; the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and the three
               subsequent wars (1956, 1967, 1973), involving the Syr. Orth. in Palestine; the
               Lebanese civil war (1975–1990), involving the Maronites and other Syr. communities in
               Lebanon; the Turkish-Kurdish conflict in Eastern Turkey, involving mainly the Syr.
               Orth.; the Iraqi-Kurdish conflict, followed by the Iraq-Iran war (1980–88), the Gulf
               war (1990–1), and the invasion of Iraq (2003), involving the Chaldeans, Assyrians,
               Syr. Catholic, and Syr. Orth. In all these upheavals displacement and emigration has
               also been to other countries within the Middle East (or even within the same
               country), as well as to countries outside it (with or without refugee status). A
               further cause of emigration has been the lack of educational or employment
               opportunities in the countries of origin; this had already led to the earliest
               immigration to the United States (<ref rend="bold">Chicago</ref>, New Britain, CT) from
               north-west Iran (<ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref> region) in the late 19th cent.</p>
                    <p>The massacres of 1895/6 and 1915–18 led to large scale emigration, both within the
               Middle East (mainly to Syria, Lebanon, Palestine in the case of the Syr. Orth.; to
               Iraq, Iran, and the Caucasus [and thence, to Russia] in the case of the Chaldeans and
               Assyrians) and to the West, above all at this stage to the Americas, both North and
               South. The flight of Assyrians from Iraq in 1933 resulted in new settlements in
               eastern Syria, while others emigrated to Britain and especially the United States.
               The Americas were also the goal of most of those emigrating after the creation of
               Israel, and it has only been in the last 50 years that large numbers from all the
               Syr. Churches have emigrated to countries of western Europe, with a preponderance of
               Syr. Orth. settling in Germany (where the first priest was ordained in 1977) and
               Sweden, and of Chaldeans and Maronites in France. An important development in the
               case of the Syr. Orth. was the founding of three monasteries by the late bp. <ref rend="bold">Julius Çiçek</ref> (Mor Ephrem, Netherlands, 1984; Mor Augen,
               Switzerland, 1999; Mor Yaʿqub da-Srug, Germany, 2000). Smaller communities from the
               different Syr. Churches are also found in Russia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium,
               Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Britain, and Greece. More recently emigration on a large
               scale has also been to Australia. A pattern followed in many cases has been for
               emigrés from a particular village to settle together in their new home. Since 2003 it
               has been Syria, Jordan, and Turkey that have been the immediate goals of those
               fleeing from the dangerous situation in Iraq.</p>
                    <p>The increasing sizes of the Diaspora communities has led to the creation of new
               dioceses outside the Middle East, following on from the earlier establishment of
               church communities in the different countries. The main topic of the 16th Congress of
               Catholic Patriarchs of the Middle East in 2006 was emigration. The following listing
               of Diaspora dioceses gives some idea of the geographical spread for each of the Syr.
               Churches; figures for numbers, where given, are inevitably only approximate (these
               can vary considerably from one source to another).</p>

                    <p>The different Indian Churches of Syr. tradition also have considerable diasporas all
               over the world, and several now have a North American diocese (Syro-Malabar: Chicago,
               since 2001; Syro-Malankara: for America and Europe, since 2005; Syrian Orthodox:
               Cartaret, New Jersey; Orthodox Syrian: Alma, Michigan, and Belrose, New York). There
               are communities in several European countries from all the Syr. Churches in India
               (especially Great Britain, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria). Many from
               Kerala go as temporary workers to the Gulf states, in some of which churches have
               been built.</p>
                    <p>The above locations only cover countries where church communities have been
               established; for individuals from the Syr. Churches of the Middle East, the scatter
               is much wider, and includes countries of Africa and East Asia.</p>
                    <p>The move to secular societies where ethnic and cultural, rather than religious,
               identity is paramount has caused much dispute in the search for appropriate names to
               use (Aramaean, Assyrian, Chaldean, Assyro-Chaldean, Syriac, <hi rend="italic">Suryoyo</hi>, etc.), and the issue has often proved sadly divisive, especially
               among the Syr. Orth. On the other hand, many new opportunities have been opened up,
               for the creation of cultural and other associations, and for new educational
               possibilities. In the 1930s when for a time it was Soviet policy to encourage
               minority languages, the written use of Modern Syriac (in Latin script) was
               encouraged; a more recent adaptation of the spoken language to western script has
               taken place with <ref rend="bold">Turoyo</ref> in Sweden. Especially important has been
               the freedom to publish in western countries. This has given rise to a great many
               cultural magazines, often multilingual (and including both Classical and Modern
               Syriac), as well as the creation of television channels (such as Suryoyo SAT, Suroyo
               TV, Assyrian TV); it has also made it possible to publish information about <hi rend="italic">Sayfo</hi>. Another notable development has been in the creation of
               music groups, both church-based and secular, the latter using lyrics in both
               Classical and Modern Syriac; though this development had its origins in the Middle
               East (e.g. Qamishli in the 1960s, and rather earlier in Iran), it has been greatly
               developed in the Diaspora.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Title of a Gospel harmony composed in the 2nd cent.; the first-known Gospel
               translation into Syriac. The title is Greek, meaning ‘through [the] four [Gospels]’.
               In the Syriac world it was known either by its transliterated Greek name (<hi rend="italic">diyaṭessaron</hi>) or as the <hi rend="italic">ewangeliyon
                  da-mḥallṭe</hi> (‘Gospel of the mixed’, as contrasted with the <hi rend="italic">ewangeliyon da-mparrše</hi>, ‘Gospel of the separated’). The Diatessaron occupied
               a preeminent position in the Syrian Church in the first four centuries. <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref> often appears to cite the Gospels in the form of the
               Diatessaron. <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> composed his Commentary on the Diatessaron.
               The Syrian-born hymnographer <ref rend="bold">Romanos the Melodist</ref> quotes its
               text in his Greek hymns. Later commentators and writers (e.g., <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>, <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>) all speak
               of it with great respect. Bar Brikha even imputes to Tatian an almost mystical grasp
               of the ‘intention’ of the evangelists, enabling him to accurately harmonize the
               Gospels without loosing or distorting anything. The evidence of the <ref rend="bold">Teaching of Addai</ref> and bp. <ref rend="bold">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref>
               (‘Compendium of Heretical Fables’, I.20) are proof of the Diatessaron’s
               ecclesiastical, liturgical use into the early 5th cent. Theodoret reports he
               confiscated ‘more than 200 copies in reverential use in the churches of our diocese’,
               and replaced the Diatessaron with the four separate Gospels (<hi rend="italic">ewangeliyon da-mparrše</hi>). And it must be assumed that Canon 43 of Bp. <ref rend="bold">Rabbula of Edessa</ref>, which requires the use of the <hi rend="italic">ewangeliyon da-mparrše</hi> in churches, is also directed against the
               Diatessaron. Eventually the Diatessaron was replaced by the <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac
                  Version</ref> of the separate Gospels and, eventually, the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>. Even in these, however, the Diatessaron’s influence is
               discernable in specific harmonizations and turns of phrase.</p>
                    <p>Although the origin of the Diatessaron is enshrouded in darkness, it was most likely
               compiled by <ref rend="bold">Tatian</ref>, the author of an ‘Oration to the Greeks’
               (preserved in Greek) who describes himself as an ‘Assyrian’ (the exact geographical
               meaning of which is debated: either Mesopotamia or Syria). After sampling many
               philosophies in the mid–2nd cent., he converted to Christianity and ended up in Rome
               where he studied under Justin Martyr. It seems that Justin was already using a Gospel
               harmony, apparently based on the synoptic Gospels. After Justin’s death (between 163
               and 167), Tatian ran afoul of the Roman congregation. <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref>
               says that he was expelled from the Roman congregation in 172. After that we have only
               a report of <ref rend="bold">Epiphanius</ref>, stating that he returned to the East,
               where he founded a school. Given this history, it seems unlikely that Tatian would
               have created the Diatessaron while Justin (with whom he seems to have had good
               relations) was alive. Similarly, since no Greek (‘Western’) source speaks of the
               Diatessaron prior to Eusebius (and Eusebius was an Easterner in practice, and wrote
               in the East), it seems unlikely that the Diatessaron was composed in Rome. Rather, it
               is more likely to have been composed on the way back to the East, or in the East,
               shortly after 172. Evidence suggests that the Diatessaron was composed in <ref rend="bold">Syriac</ref> (see below). If correct, this too would favour composition
               in the East (but it should not be interpreted as precluding composition in the West,
               for Syriac was used in Rome in the 2nd cent.). While the use of the Diatessaron in
               early Syriac Christianity presupposes an early date for its composition, Tatian’s
               authorship is not explicitly mentioned in any of the early Syriac sources. Not
               surprisingly, therefore, his authorship has been questioned in recent research
               (Koltun-Fromm).</p>
                    <p>A Gospel harmony is a complicated creation. It seeks, by acute literary skill, to
               conflate parallel accounts. Duplications are excised, conflicts are resolved, and
               nothing of importance is lost. Various reasons for Tatian’s efforts have been
               suggested; none, on its own, is convincing, and the reality probably lies in a
               combination of motives. First, in his only other surviving literary work, his
               ‘Oration to the Greeks’, Tatian emphasizes the unity of truth. Four canonical Gospels
               as well as numerous extra-canonical Gospels do not present a ‘unity’ which, for
               Tatian, was the hallmark of truth. Here, then, one can discern a motive for creating
               a single, harmonized account. Second, the contradictions and inconsistencies in the
               Gospels had led critics such as Celsus to ridicule Christianity. One way to resolve
               these problems was Marcion’s: to select one gospel and exclude all others. But the
               same problem may also be solved as Tatian did: create one Gospel — a harmony — out of
               the many. A third motive may simply have been the spirit of the times. Tatian’s
               teacher Justin used a harmony, and other harmonies circulated in the early Church. In
               other words, Tatian may simply have been doing what others were doing. Fourth, the
               2nd-cent. view of the task of an historian was to sift through the sometimes
               contradictory individual accounts of an event and then, through the exercise of sound
               historical judgement, write the single definitive account. According to this view,
               Tatian saw himself as an historian; the Gospels were ‘raw material’ for an historian;
               the Diatessaron was therefore a scholarly work of a ‘professional’ historian.</p>
                    <p>The Diatessaron is extremely important for recovering the oldest text of the Gospels.
               It is obvious that Tatian, when composing his harmony, had to use the Gospels in the
               form they had in the mid-2nd cent. He also, apparently, availed himself of Justin’s
               already-extant harmony of the synoptic Gospels, augmenting it with material from the
               Gospel of John and then recasting its sequence. Therefore, the Diatessaron preserves
               numerous ancient deviating readings — that is, readings which deviate from modern
               critical editions of the Gospels, but which agree with other 2nd cent. sources (such
               as the Jewish-Christian Gospel fragments, the ‘Gospel of Thomas’, Justin, etc.). This
               means that when he composed the Diatessaron, Tatian either used (proto-) canonical
               Gospels whose text contained readings now found only in the Jewish-Christian Gospels,
               or that, in addition to the canonical Gospels, he also used extra-canonical sources,
               including one or more Jewish-Christian Gospels.</p>
                    <p>Today no direct copies of the Diatessaron survive. Its text must be reconstructed
               through a painstaking collation and comparison of numerous ‘witnesses’ to the
               Diatessaron: an assortment of translations (into both Eastern and Western languages)
               and patristic quotations. These include translations (sometimes heavily revised) into
               Arabic, Latin, Old Italian, Old High German, Middle Dutch, Middle High German, Middle
               English, and other languages. A Persian harmony also exists, but its sequence is very
               different from that of the Diatessaron, even though in many individual variants it
               seems to agree with the Diatessaron. It should be noted that a gospel harmony has two
               distinctive features which can be used for identification: 1. the sequence of
               harmonization, and 2. the individual variant readings within a verse.</p>
                    <p>The Diatessaron’s influence was not limited to Syria, but extended to other areas,
               both Eastern and Western. It is thought that the Gospels first appeared in Armenian
               in the form of a translation of the Diatessaron, and it influenced the translation of
               the separate Gospels into Georgian. We even find its distinctive readings in the
               Manichaean texts written in Parthian and found at Turfan, in China. In the West, the
               oldest known translation of the Gospels into Middle Dutch is a Gospel harmony (known
               as ‘the Liège Harmony’) related to the Diatessaron; and while not the oldest Gospel
               translation into Old High German (that honour goes to a few fragments at a cloister
               in Monsee, Austria), a Gospel harmony related to the Diatessaron, Codex Sangallensis,
               is the oldest <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> Gospel text in Old High German.</p>
                    <p>It is on the basis of these Western witnesses to the Diatessaron that one can reach a
               judgement about its original language. The presence of Syriacisms or Semitisms in
               these ‘Western’ witnesses to the Diatessaron can only be explained by presuming that
               their archetype was a document composed in a Semitic language, not Greek or
               Latin.</p>
                    <p>Because of the Diatessaron’s paramount importance for both the text and canon of the
               NT, much scholarly effort has gone into reconstructing its text. Equally important,
               however, is its position as the oldest of the versions, a translation and
               rearrangement of the Gospels that had world-wide impact, from England to China.</p>

                    <p>Bp., writer and educator. He was born on 8 Nov. 1833 in Ras Keifa, and was raised in
               Kfar Zina, near Tripoli. He studied at the College at ʿAyn Warqa, a successor to the
               Maronite College in Rome since 1789. He established in 1851 a school in Tripoli where
               he taught Arabic until 1852. He was ordained priest in 1855, and taught (1855– 1860)
               at Mar Yuḥanna Marun school in Kfar Ḥay. He was appointed secretary to Patr. Bulus
               Masʿad (1854–90), and consecrated bp. of <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref> in 1872. He
               helped to establish the <ref rend="bold">printing</ref> press at Ahden in 1859, which
               was later bought by Dayr Quzḥayya, and became partner in the General Press
               (al-Maṭbaʿa al-ʿUmumiyya). He engaged in many polemical discussions, esp. with Bp.
               Yousef Daoud of the Syr. Cath. Church. He established a number of schools, most
               notably Al-Ḥikma in 1878 in Beirut. He built a number of churches, esp. the Maron.
               Cathedral in Beirut in 1894. He was a contemporary of St. Sharbil.</p>
                    <p>A complete list of his literary works, numbering 44 items, is given by Ḥayek. Of
               relevance are: 1. a history of Syria in 8 vols. (1893–1905), with an abridged edition
               (1907); 2. <hi rend="italic">al-Jāmiʿ al-Mufaṣṣal</hi>, being the sections from the

               Epistles in Garshuni (1886, 1897, 1901); three liturgical books on the Divine Liturgy
               (all in 1888); <hi rend="italic">Šḥimto</hi>(1890). Finally, he translated

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Collection of teachings attributed to the twelve apostles. While the provenance of
               the Didascalia Apostolorum is subject to scholarly debate, the work probably
               originated in Syria during the 3rd cent. Of the Greek original only fragments remain;
               there are, however, a number of early translations. Most significant among these is
               the Syriac translation which is preserved in numerous mss. dated or datable between
               the 7th (or 8th) and the 20th cent. Vööbus’s 1979 edition includes the evidence of 18
               mss., while an additional 23 mss. contain legislative texts that were incorporated in
               the third chapter of the Didascalia Apostolorum but that also circulated separately.
               Some of the mss. show traces of a later revision. A fragment of the Didascalia
               survives furthermore in a 9th-cent. Syriac papyrus, of which Sauget and Brock have
               each published a folio.The number of Syriac mss. and their geographical as well as
               chronological spread attest to the significance of the work within the juridical
               tradition of Syriac Christianity. The date of the Syriac translation is difficult to
               ascertain; scholars have variously attributed it to the mid-4th cent. (Vööbus,
               Connolly) or the late 5th through early 6th cent. (Brock, Schöllgen). While the
               Syriac translation of the Didascalia has occasionally been ascribed to <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, such a claim lacks scholarly support. A Latin translation
               from the late 4th cent. is also extant, as well as later Arabic and Ethiopic
               translations. The Didascalia has further been preserved in Greek in the 4th cent.
               ‘Apostolic Constitutions’, of which the Didascalia makes up the lion’s share.</p>
                    <p>A pseudepigraphical document, the Didascalia claims to be the product of the twelve
               apostles. Its real author remains unknown, although the emphasis on instructing
               bishops has led scholars to suspect episcopal authorship. The document’s stated
               purpose is the defense of the church against heretics and schismatics, particularly
               Judaizing Christians (ch. 26). The Didascalia, however, contains a wide range of
               other material, including advice on the selection and duties of bishops (chs. 4–8,
               11–12, 18), male and female deacons (chs. 11, 16), as well as other church officers;
               instructions on church discipline and penitential practice (chs. 5–7, 9–11);
               theological direction (ch. 20), and guidelines for appropriate behavior of various
               groups of lay people within the church (chs. 14–15, 17, 19, 22). Interestingly, the
               Didascalia supports its arguments with extensive citations from Scripture, so much so
               that it resembles a topical commentary for church use. Because of its diverse content
               and regulatory aims, the Didascalia has been categorized as belonging to the Church
               Order genre, a designation the Didascalia shares with, e.g., the Didache and the
               Apostolic Tradition of <ref rend="bold">Hippolytus</ref>. While the existence of such a
               genre has recently been called into question, the grouping of the Didascalia with
               other legislative texts in ancient codices, as well as the interpolation of
               legislative material concerning, e.g., the election of clergy, between chs. 3 and 4
               supports its consideration as an early fore-runner of canon law collections.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Scholar and reform-minded educator. He was born in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> to ʿAbd
               al-Karīm Dinno and grew up at a time when his Church was at the low ebb, having
               emerged from nearly a half cent. of Catholic conversion. He also witnessed the
               arrival of refugees fleeing the 1915 massacres of Syriacs and Armenians in
               Southeastern Turkey. He saw the dire need to educate the members of his community,
               young and old in the virtues of his church beliefs and in the richness of its Syriac
               liturgy and heritage. He was consecrated a deacon on 30 March 1941, and an
               archdeacon, by which title he was widely known, on 6 April of the same year by
               Athanasius Tumo Qaṣīr. Apart from initial schooling at St. Thomas School in Mosul
               from 1909 to 1918, he was self-taught. He later became a successfull merchant. He
               mastered the Syriac language and wrote several grammar text books for it. He wrote a
               number of books and articles defending the Syr. Orth. Church and its beliefs against
               what he saw as defamations and distortions of historic facts. He wrote on the <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref> and Syriac culture and on church history and commented on
               literary works by others. He paid particular attention to church music. He complied
               and published a hymn book in Arabic for the Arabic-speaking community of his Church
               in the Middle East. This was a pioneering enterprise as the book is still extensively
               used in the Middle East and in the Syriac <ref rend="bold">diaspora</ref>. On church
               revival, he worked closely with Patr. <ref rend="bold">Afram Barsoum</ref>. He was in
               the forefront of the effort to introduce structural church reform, and to promote
               better education of the clergy through the newly established St. Ephrem Seminary, in
               which he also taught. He died in 1951, leaving behind a legacy that bore the imprints
               of a man who was devoted to the betterment of the Church that he so deeply loved to
               meet the challenges of a new era. Part of this legacy was several unfinished literary
               works, which Patr. Zakka I ʿIwas has published over the years in the Patriarchal
               Magazine.</p>

               3815–22), bp. of Tarsus. A native of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, and teacher of
                  <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Theodore of
                  Mopsuestia</ref>, he was renowned in his own day as an exegete. As an important
               representative of Antiochene christology and exegesis, his works came under a cloud,
               along with those of Theodore, in the 6th cent. and so much has been lost, though his
               Commentary on Psalms escaped thanks to its re-attribution to Anastasius (Ps. 1–50,
               ed. J.-M. Olivier, CCSG 6, 1980; the remainder in PG 33). Although he is regarded as
               one of the three ‘Greek Doctors’ (with Theodore and <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref>)
               in the Ch. of E., most of what survives in Syriac comes from hostile sources.
               Quotations from, or references to, his ‘On Providence’, however, are to be found
               notably in <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of

                    <p>Metropolitan of <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>, and prolific Syr. Orth. author. A
               biography, by Patr. <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, is unfortunately lost. He was
               probably born in <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref>, which was an important meeting point
               for Syriac and Greek cultures in the 12th cent. His baptismal name was Yaʿqub. His
               earliest work was a refutation of a book written by <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of
                  Mardin</ref>, who had claimed that the fall of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> to the
               Seljuks in 1144 took place against God’s will. At Yuḥanon’s request, the Patr. put
               Yaʿqub (still a deacon) under an interdict, but later, once he had read Yaʿqub’s
               work, lifted this and appointed him bp. of Marʿash (Germanikia), with the episcopal
               name Dionysios (1148). After the capture of Marʿash by the Armenians in 1156 he
               returned to Melitene. In 1164/5, he was offered the see of Amid but declined it,
               though was later persuaded to accept, after Michael had become patr. (Oct. 1166). At
               Amid Dionysios restored the church of the Yoldat Aloho.</p>
                    <p>Dionysios died in November 1171, and was buried on the south side of the church of
               the Yoldat Aloho in Amid, alongside two patriarchs (Michael, Chronicle, III, 344–5).
               He must have been at least 50 years old, and perhaps considerably more. He was
               succeeded as bp. by his synkellos Abraham who, however, died shortly afterwards
               (Michael, Chronicle, III, 354).</p>
                    <p>Two slightly conflicting lists of his works survive, one in Michael’s Chronicle (III,
               344–5), the other separately (printed in Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, vol.
               2, 210–11). Many of the works named in these lists do not survive, while those that
               do survive have so far only partly been published.</p>
                    <p>Main extant works:</p>
                    <p>1. Commentaries on the Old Testament. Dionysios was the first Syr. Orth. writer to
               provide a commentary on the entire Bible. He draws on a great variety of earlier
               commentators, both Greek (in Syriac translation) and Syriac, including commentators
               from the Ch. of E. Much of the commentary on the OT was arranged in two parts,
               ‘material’ (<hi rend="italic">suʿronoʾit</hi>) and ‘spiritual’ (<hi rend="italic">ruḥonoʾit</hi>). Of the OT commentaries only those on Psalms 73–82 (ed. S. D.
               Ryan, <hi rend="italic">Dionysius bar Salibi’s Factual and Spiritual Commentary on
                  Psalms 73–82</hi>[Cahiers de la Revue Biblique 57; 2004]) and the ‘spiritual’
               commentary on Qohelet (based on the <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref>, rather than
               the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>) have so far been published (W. Strothmann, GOFS
               31, 1988). The commentaries on other OT books remain unpublished, though some have
               been studied in dissertations. The oldest ms. was copied in 1189, only 18 years after
               his death (for mss., see A. Vööbus, in <hi rend="italic">ZAW</hi> 84 [1972],
               246–9).</p>
                    <p>2. Commentaries on the New Testament. The Commentaries on Matt., Mark, Luke, Acts,
               Catholic Epistles, and Apocalypse have been published by I. Sedlacek, J.-B. Chabot,
               and A. Vaschalde, with LT: Gospels, I.1 (CSCO 15–16; 1906); I.2 (CSCO 77, 85; 1915,
               1922); II.1 (CSCO 95, 98; 1931, 1933); II.2 (CSCO 113–4; 1939, 1940); Acts, Catholic
               Epistles, and Apocalypse (CSCO 53, 60; 1909, 1910). The Comm. on John was later
               published (without tr.) by R. Lejoly (1975). That on the Pauline Epistles remains
               unpublished (for mss., see A. Vööbus in <hi rend="italic">Abr Nahrain</hi> 9
               [1969/70], 39–42). The commentary on the Apocalypse preserves some quotations from
               the otherwise lost treatise of <ref rend="bold">Hippolytus</ref> against Gaius.</p>
                    <p>3. Commentary on the Liturgy, ed. with LT by H. Labourt (CSCO 13–14; 1903). There is
               an ET by B. Varghese, <hi rend="italic">Dionysius Bar Salibi. Commentary on the
                  Eucharist</hi> (Kottayam, 1998). Besides the commentary on the Eucharistic liturgy
               just mentioned, Dionysios also commented on the baptismal service and the Myron (ed.
               with ET by B. Varghese, <hi rend="italic">Dionysius Bar Salibi. Commentary on Myron
                  and Baptism</hi> [Moran Etho 29; 2006]).</p>
                    <p>4. Commentary on <ref rend="bold">Evagrius</ref>’s Centuries. The Syriac text (from a
               Berlin ms.) has been edited by Mor Julius Çiçek (Glane/Losser; 1991).</p>
                    <p>5. Commentary on <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>’s logical works (Organon). This
               commentary covers <ref rend="bold">Porphyry</ref>’s Eisagoge (‘Introduction’) and the
               first three books of the corpus of Aristotle’s logical works, namely, Categories,
               Interpretation, and Analytics I–II. The work was completed in 1148, shortly after
               Dionysios had become bp. of Marʿash. Dionysios states that his purpose was to provide
               an abbreviation of previous commentators. At the end of the work he complains about
               the barbarity and ignorance shown by the Syriac translator of Analytics  II. The work
               survives, not quite complete, in ms. Cambridge Gg. 2.14 (unpublished).</p>
                    <p>6. Polemical Works. Of his polemical works only the treatises against the Armenians
               (ed. A. Mingana, in <hi rend="italic">Woodbrooke Studies</hi> 4 [1931], with ET), the
               Melkites (ed. Mingana, in <hi rend="italic">Woodbrooke Studies</hi> 1 [1927], with
               ET), the Jews (ed. de Zwaan, 1906; text only), and the Muslims (J. P. Amar, CSCO
               614–5; 2005) have been published. There are important studies of the last by A.
               Mingana (<hi rend="italic">BJRL</hi>9 [1925], 188–240, on Qurʾān quotations) and S.
               H. Griffith (<hi rend="italic">SymSyr</hi> IV, 353–65). An analysis of the treatise
               against the Nestorians was given by F. Nau in <hi rend="italic">ROC</hi> II.4 (1909),
               298–320.</p>
                    <p>7. Anaphoras. Three anaphoras attributed to Dionysios are known, but only the first
               (which is also sometimes attributed to <ref rend="bold">Dionysius the Areopagite</ref>)
               has been published (e.g. Pampakuda editions of 1976, 1986; ed. Çiçek, 1985; LT in E.
               Renaudot, <hi rend="italic">Liturgiarum Orientalium Collectio</hi> [1847], vol. 2,
               448–52).</p>
                    <p>8. Canons. The penitential canons associated with Dionysios’s name survive in many
               different forms, whose interrelationships are studied by A. Vööbus in <hi rend="italic">Kanonessammlungen</hi>, vol. IB (CSCO 317; 1970), 405–39; for other
               canons attributed to Dionysios see <hi rend="italic">Kanonessammlungen</hi>, vol. IA,
               240–53.</p>
                    <p>Lost works:</p>
                    <p>1. Commentaries on the doctrinal works of <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>,
                  <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nyssa</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Basil</ref>, Dionysius the
               Areopagite, <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Peter of
               Kallinikos</ref>.</p>
                    <p>2. On Providence: written in response to Yuḥanon of Mardin’s work, after the fall of
               Edessa in 1144.</p>
                    <p>3. Chronicle: The preface for this is preserved by Michael (Chronicle, III, 257).
               Though he had intended to write a world chronicle, he only had time to deal with
               contemporary history.</p>
                    <p>4. Two 12 syllable <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> on the two captures of Edessa,
               mentioned by Michael (Chronicle, III, 267).</p>
                    <p>5. Three discourses on the destruction of Marʿash by the Armenians (Chronicle, III,
               314).</p>
                    <p>6. Two <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> on an episode where a Maphrian was imprisoned for
               his judgement over the betrothal of a Christian daughter of a Christian who had
               converted to Islam (the episode is related by <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, Eccl.

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Patr. 818–45, historian. Dionysios came from the village of Tel Maḥre. He was a monk
               in the monastery of John bar Aphtonia at <ref rend="bold">Qenneshre</ref>, but after
               its destruction by fire in ca. 810, he moved to another monastery and eventually to
               the Monastery of Mar Yaʿqub at Kayshum. On 1 Aug. 818 at the synod in Kallinikos, on
               the suggestion of bp. Theodoros of the same monastery, Dionysios was elected patr.
               Then, in three successive days he was ordained deacon, priest, and patriarch
               (Michael, 503/III, 43).</p>
                    <p>At the very beginning of his pontificate he had to face opposition from Abraham, whom
               Dionysios calls Abiram (cp. Num. 16), a monk of Qarṭmin, and his followers of the
               Monastery of Gubba Barraya. The group was schismatic (Abraham ordained his own
               bishops), but also held dissenting views in the matter of the liturgical formula <hi rend="italic">Panem caelestem frangimus</hi> (‘We break the heavenly bread’),
               which they wished to be accepted by the whole Syr. Orth. Church. The conflict in this
               matter had been troubling the Church already during the pontificate of Dionysios’s
               predecessor, Patr. <ref rend="bold">Quryaqos</ref>. As it proved impossible to solve
               it, the synod of Kallinikos, at which Dionysios was elected, accepted that the usage
               of the formula was at the discretion of every bp. However not even this tolerant
               solution was accepted by Abraham’s group. Dionysios however succeeded in appeasing at
               least the people and monks of the diocese of Cyrrhus, who previously had supported
               Abraham. The latter repeatedly presented himself to the Muslim authorities as the
               legitimate patr., but without receiving official recognition (Michael 507, 508–12 /
               III, 49, 55–9), due to Dionysios’s intervention. In 820 Dionysios went to <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> where he received the confirmation of his election from
               Caliph al-Maʾmūn. In 829, after long talks with the caliph, Dionysios obtained from
               him a decree to the effect that non-legitimate bishops would not be officially
               approved by the Muslims. In this way Abraham no longer presented a threat to
               Dionysios’s authority or the unity of the Church. He died in 837, but the schism
               nevertheless continued, as Abraham’s supporters elected his brother Shemʿun
               counter-patriarch. Some bishops, however, turned their allegiance to Dionysios, so
               that this later phase of the schism was less troublesome, as Dionysios himself
               reports (Chronicle of 1234, 234/206).</p>
                    <p>Another problem Dionysios had to face was the opposition of the eastern (maphrianate)
               bishops, among whom the main figure was Basil bp. of <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref>. As
               he antagonised also the Muslims of his diocese, he was arrested by the Muslim
               authorities, which however also led to anti-Christian acts of violence, including
               destruction of churches, e.g. in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref>. Dionysios, together with his brother, <ref rend="bold">Theodosios bp.
                  of Edessa</ref>, went to Egypt to meet Emir ʿAbdallāh, from whom he received an
               edict commanding any further destruction of churches to stop and to rebuild the ones
               that had been destroyed (Michael, 516 / III, 63–4).</p>
                    <p>Dionysios’s relations with the Muslim authorities were so good that on the caliph’s
               request he even intervened far beyond his own jurisdiction, namely in the matters of
               a group of Coptic Christians, known as Bashmurites, who had revolted against their
               Muslim oppressors. It seems that thanks to his intervention the caliph did not punish
               them with death but deportation.</p>
                    <p>During his pontificate Dionysios ordained 99 bishops (Michael, 754–55 / III, 453–55).
               He died on 22 Aug. 845 and was buried in his former monastery of Qenneshre.</p>
                    <p>Dionysios was the author of an historical work in two parts, dealing with
               ecclesiastical (written earlier) and with secular matters, altogether in 16 books.
               Dedicated to <ref rend="bold">Iwannis of Dara</ref>, it covered the period of over two
               and a half centuries, from the accession of the Byzantine emperor Maurice (582) until
               the death of Emperor Theophilos and of Caliph Abū Isḥāq al-Muʿtaṣim (842) (Michael,
               Chronicle, 544 / III, 111). It has not been preserved, except for fragments (ed.
               Brooks, CSCO 84, 88) and is known mostly from later Syriac chronicles, whose authors
               used it as their source, namely the anonymous <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of 1234</ref>
               and the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Dionysios’s sources are not directly known, but the analyses by J.-B. Chabot
               (Introduction to <hi rend="italic">Chronique de Michel</hi>, XXXII–XXXIV) and A.
               Palmer and R. Hoyland (<hi rend="italic">The Seventh Century</hi>, 95–104) have
               identified some of them: Daniel son of Mushe (8th cent.), Yoḥannan son of Shmu’el,
                  <ref rend="bold">Theophilos</ref> the ‘Chalcedonian’, son of Toma of Edessa, the
               Common Source of the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes (d. 818), the Melkite Agapius of
               Mabbug, who wrote in Arabic (10th cent.), part of the material preserved in the
               Chronicle to the year 724, and some other Syriac, but also Greek and Arabic
               sources.</p>
                    <p>Due to an erroneous attribution by J. S. Assemani, Dionysios was until the end of the
               19th century considered to be the author of the anonymous <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of
                  Zuqnin</ref>, which consequently became known as that of Pseudo-Dionysios of Tel
               Maḥre.</p>
                    <p>Dionysios also promulgated some disciplinary canons, preserved in the Synodicon of
               the Syr. Orth. Church (ed. Vööbus). Another text of his is his profession of faith in
               Arabic, most probably one that he sent to the Coptic patr. of Alexandria (as was
               customary for newly elected patriarchs of both churches), in which, however, he says
               nothing about the current issues (the <hi rend="italic">Panem caelestem</hi>
               controversy).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Greek author of an influential corpus of mystical writings. The author, whose
               identity remains unclear, must have been writing after the Neoplatonist Proclus
               (d. 485), upon whose works he draws, and before 532, when the writings are first
               mentioned; it is likely that he was writing in Syria or Palestine. The corpus
               consists of books entitled: On the Celestial Hierarchy (CH); On the Ecclesiastical
               Hierarchy (EH); the Divine Names (DN); the Mystical Theology (MT); and 10 Letters.
               These were translated into Syriac by <ref rend="bold">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref> (d.
               536), and again, in a revised form by Phocas of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> in the
               late 7th cent. The former survives in a single ms. (Sinai Syr. 52), the latter in
               several mss. The earlier version is a particularly important witness to the earliest
               form of the Greek text (critical edition by B. Suchla, G. Heil and A. M. Ritter, in
                  <hi rend="italic">PTS</hi> 33, 36; 1990, 1991); Sergios’s translation provides the
               unusual order of DN, CH, MT, EH, Letters. Neither Syriac version has yet been
               published in full; thus the only editions available so far are: MT, ch. 1: J.-M.
               Hornus, in <hi rend="italic">ParOr</hi> 1 (1970), 69–94 (both versions); and EH,
               ch. 4 (on Myron): W. Strothmann, GOFS 15: 1–2 (1977) (both versions).</p>
                    <p>Already in the 6th cent. the Corpus was provided with Greek Scholia by John
               Scholasticus, and later by others too; those by John were also translated into
               Syriac, and further scholia were added by a number of Syriac authors. The scholia are
               only found in mss. of Phocas’s version.</p>
                    <p>There are also several later Syriac works associated with Dionysius the Areopagite:
               1. The Book of the Holy Hierotheos (ed. with ET, F. S. Marsh; 1927), probably by <ref rend="bold">Sṭephanos bar Ṣudayli</ref>; this work claims to be by the teacher of
               Dionysius; on it see K. Pinggéra, <hi rend="italic">All-Erlösung und All-Einheit</hi>
               (2002); 2. A supposed autobiography (ed. M. Kugener, in <hi rend="italic">OC</hi> 7
               [1907], 292–348); 3. an astronomical and meteorological treatise (ed. Kugener, in <hi rend="italic">Actes XIV Congrès International des Orientalistes</hi>, vol. 2
               (1905), 137–94; also by G. Furlani, in <hi rend="italic">JRAS</hi>1917, 245–72); and
               4. an Anaphora (ed. M. Vidalis, forthcoming).</p>

               author of the <hi rend="italic">Téchnē grammatikē</hi>́ (‘Art of Grammar’), which
               became the standard grammar handbook in Constantinople after the 5th cent. The
               attribution of the treatise to Dionysius has been long debated, but there is now some
               agreement that the book is the result of the compilation of chronologically
               heterogeneous materials. The work, of which an Armenian translation also exists, was
               adapted into Syriac in the 6th cent. This translation is attributed by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> and by E.-Syr. mss. to the <hi rend="italic">maqryānā</hi> (‘teacher of reading’) <ref rend="bold">Yawsep Huzaya</ref> (d.
               before 580), disciple of <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref> at the <ref rend="bold">School of
                  Nisibis</ref>, and author of linguistic and philological studies that have not
               survived. The name of the translator is missing in the W.-Syr. ms. tradition. The
               Syriac version of the <hi rend="italic">Téchnē grammatikē</hi>́ presents a
               contrastive analysis of Syriac and Greek, and its reflection on Syriac morphosyntax
               shows a certain degree of originality. In this adaptation the first ten chapters of
               the text are missing. While the omission of chapters 2–9, which treat orthographic,
               phonologic, and prosodic issues, can be explained with the difficulties of applying
               Greek grammatical categories to the Syriac language, the absence of the first,
               programmatic chapter has been tentatively related to a possible reluctance on the
               part of the translator to praise the study of literary pagan texts (Contini).</p>

                    <p>Modern writer, educator and Syr. Orth. bp. of <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> (1947–69).
               He was born and raised in Mardin and embarked on a shoe-making career. As he was the
               only son to his parents, they objected to his idea of becoming a monk. Dolabani left
               his career and toured various local monasteries. At the request of his parents, Patr.
                  <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdullāh Ṣaṭṭūf</ref> tried to convince young Yuḥanon to forget
               about monastic life, but to no avail. In 1907, he joined Dayro d-Noṭpo, became a monk
               in 1908, and was ordained priest in 1918. He taught at the local school of <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>, other monasteries, and the Syr. Orth. Orphanage
               of Adana (see <ref rend="bold">Taw Mim Semkath</ref>). Dolabani accompanied Patr. <ref rend="bold">Eliya III</ref> on two pastoral tours in the Middle East: the first in
               1919 prompted by the aftermath of World War I and the <ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref>
               massacres, and the second in 1925 to <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> where he spent two years teaching at <ref rend="bold">Monastery of
                  St. Mark</ref>. When the newly consecrated Patr. <ref rend="bold">Afram
                  Barsoum</ref> moved the patriarchal seat from Mardin to <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref>
               in 1933 due to current socio-political difficulties, the community leadership in
               Mardin desired to elect Dolabani as anti-Patr. in defiance. Dolabani rejected the
               move and denounced rumours of any such election publicly in 1934. In 1947, Mardin
               became a diocese and Dolabani was consecrated its bp. He spent his last days at Dayr
               al-Zaʿfarān where he was buried.</p>
                    <p>He edited the following works: an abridged version of the <hi rend="italic">Beth
                  Gazo</hi> (Mardin, 1913); a prayer book for priests (Mardin, 1952); a list of
               lectionary readings (Mardin, 1954); selected poems of <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref> (Jerusalem, 1929); poems of <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon Bar Maʿdani</ref>
               (Jerusalem, 1929); poems of <ref rend="bold">Nuḥ the Lebanese</ref> (1956); and Bar
               ʿEbroyo’s ‘Book of the Dove’ (Mardin, 1916). He authored over 40 books in Syriac,
               Arabic, and Turkish, the most important of which are the following: A pedagogical
               Syriac Grammar (vol. 1, Mardin, 1915; vol. 2 Glane/Losser, 1997); A history of the
               patriarchs (Glane/Losser, 1990); and Catalogues of the Syriac mss. of Dayro d-Mor
               Marqos, Dayr al-Zaʿfarān, and other churches and monasteries (Aleppo, 1994). Finally,
               he translated many works from Arabic into Syriac, especially Barsoum’s <hi rend="italic">al-Luʾluʾ al-manthūr</hi>, and Boulos Behnam’s drama <hi rend="italic">Theodora</hi>. Dolabani drew up a list of his writings of 82 items,
               most of which remain unpublished. His autobiography was published posthumously (<hi rend="italic">Tašʿito d-ḥayaw d-Dolabani</hi>, 2007).</p>

                        <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref> poetic genre. Probably deriving from the Semitic root
                  *<hi rend="italic">drk</hi> ‘to tread, step on’, the term seems to be related to
               the Mesopotamian Aramaic word &lt;<hi rend="italic">ʾdrktʾ</hi>&gt; ‘song, hymn’. The
               spelling <hi rend="italic">dureg</hi> (from Classical Syriac *<hi rend="italic">drg</hi> ‘to step forward’) is common in Urmi Neo-Aramaic. Kurdish etymologies
               have also been proposed: <hi rend="italic">du-</hi> ‘two’ + <hi rend="italic">rêk</hi> ‘in good order’ &gt; ‘couplet’; Arabic *<hi rend="italic">dwr</hi> ‘be
               circular’ + Kurdish -<hi rend="italic">ek</hi> (see the Dehok Jewish Neo-Aramaic
               equivalent, meaning ‘round bread’) &gt; ‘cyclic poem’. In the mss., <hi rend="italic">dorekthā</hi> (pl. <hi rend="italic">dorekyāthā</hi>) is used as an equivalent of
               Classical Syriac <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi>, <hi rend="italic">soghithā</hi>, or
                  <hi rend="italic">ʿonithā</hi>. Although the first authors (<ref rend="bold">Israel
                  of Alqosh</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Yawsep of Telkepe</ref>) were not Catholic, ms.
               collections of <hi rend="italic">dorekyāthā</hi> have been preserved by the Chald.
               communities of Northern Iraq and from the 19th cent. onwards the genre has been
               cultivated predominantly by Chald. poets. The 19th-cent. <hi rend="italic">dorekthā</hi> On the Virgin Mary (1st line <hi rend="italic">B-šemmā d-bābā
                  u-bronā</hi> ‘In the name of the Father and of the Son’), attributed to the Sureth
               poet David Kora or to the French Dominicain <ref rend="bold">J.  Rhétoré</ref>, has
               become a kind of national hymn for the Chaldeans of the plain of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>. The <hi rend="italic">dorekyāthā</hi> are usually structured in
               stanzas of 3, 4, or 6 lines, and their form suits the requirements of an oral
               transmission perfectly. Melodies are sometimes mentioned at the beginning of the
               text. Rhythmical repetition creates rather lengthy texts which are, however, easy to
               memorize and listener-friendly. Contents range from paraenetic exegesis to
               hagiography. From the 18th cent. onwards, Sureth poets followed the path of late
               E.-Syr. masters such as <ref rend="bold">Gewargis Warda</ref> in writing on disasters
               which befell Syrian communities: pestilences, famines, wars. For this reason the term
                  <hi rend="italic">dorekthā</hi> has sometimes been translated as ‘complaint’.</p>

                    <p>Belgian Syriac scholar, editor of CSCO Scriptores Syri and Subsidia. Educated at the
               Catholic University of Louvain, he was appointed to the Chair of Theology in 1927,
               but his critical approach to the subject resulted in his being deprived of this in
               1942, whereupon he transferred to the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, where he
               taught Oriental languages until his retirement in 1966. He was eventually
               reintegrated into the Faculty of Theology in 1948, due to the intervention of
               Cardinal G. Mercati and Pope Pius XII, and later (1965) Cardinal Suenens saw to his
               full rehabilition. He became editor of CSCO in 1948, and under his direction over 300
               volumes were published. His own early work, <hi rend="italic">Julien d’Halicarnasse
                  et sa controverse avec Sévère d’Antioche</hi>(1924), was the first to point out
               the real issues behind this controversy. His publications of Syriac texts in the CSCO
               for the most part concern the Egyptian monastic tradition: they cover the Asceticon
               of <ref rend="bold">Isaiah of Scetis</ref> (CSCO 289–90, 293–4; 1968), the Commentary
               on Abba Isaiah’s Asceticon by <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ</ref> (CSCO 326–7; 1972),
               another, anonymous, Commentary on it (CSCO 336–7; 1973), <ref rend="bold">Palladius</ref>’s ‘Lausiac History’ in its different recensions (CSCO 389–90,
               397–8; 1978), and <ref rend="bold">Athanasius</ref>’s ‘Life of Antony’ (CSCO 417–8;
               1980). Several of these volumes include long introductions, in some cases (‘Lausiac
               History’, ‘Life of Antony’), arguing that the earliest Syriac recensions were
               translated from lost forms of the Greek text; if correct, this would have important
               implications for the traditional authorship of these works. As far as the ‘Life of
               Antony’ is concerned, subsequent scholarship has mostly come down against his views.
               He had also planned to edit the Syriac Apophthegmata collections (‘Sayings of the
               Desert Fathers’), but this was unfortunately never completed. Together with R.
               Hespel, he provided the French translation of <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar
               Koni</ref>’s ‘Book of Scholia’ (CSCO 431–2; 1981), whose text alone had been
               published long ago (CSCO 55, 69; 1910, 1912) by <ref rend="bold">A. Scher</ref>, who
               was martyred in 1914.</p>

                    <p>Scholar of Aramaic, Syriac, and religions of Late Antiquity. He was Professor of
               Semitic Languages and Cultures and the Archeology of the Near East at the University
               of Groningen (The Netherlands). After his edition of the ‘Book of the Laws of
               Countries’ and his dissertation on <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref> of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (1966), his broad and varied interests in Syriac studies were
               particularly focused on the language, literature, culture, and religion of early
               Syriac Christianity and its center, the city of Edessa. His many publications in this
               field concern among other things the pagan religions in Edessa and Syria, Judaism,
               Gnosticism, Christian heresies, Manichaeism, Marcionism, and early Syriac literature
               such as the <ref rend="bold">Odes of Solomon</ref>, the works of <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, and the <ref rend="bold">Teaching of Addai</ref>. A special field of
               attention is represented by his studies of Aramaic <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref>,
               in particular the Old Syriac inscriptions of Edessa and Osrhoene. Collections of his
               scholarly articles were published in 1984 and 1994. Two Festschrifts were offered to
               him in 1999.</p>

                    <p>Ancient city situated on the west bank of the Middle Euphrates, today known as Tell
               Ṣāliḥiyya, some 90 km. south-east of Dayr al-Zor, Syria. King Seleucus Nicator
               founded the city at a place known as Dura around 300  BC and gave it the name of his
               birthplace in Macedonia, Europos. In antiquity, either the name Dura or Europos was
               used; the combined name Dura-Europos is a modern invention.</p>
                    <p>After having been ruled by the Macedonians and Greeks, the city was conquered by the
               Parthians around 113 BC and remained a military outpost of the Parthian Empire until
               AD 165. In that year the city came under Roman rule and was to play an important role
               in the defense of the Roman Empire. Around 250, the Sasanians took hold of the city.
               Following its destruction, in 256, the city was abandoned and fell into oblivion.
               Rediscovered in 1920, Dura was excavated mainly by a French-American team between
               1928 and 1937. Work was interrupted by the Second World War and was only resumed in
               1986, now by a Syrian-French mission.</p>
                    <p>Both its military role and its function as a commercial center in the trade between
               East and West explain the presence of many sojourners of various origins, having
               different religions and speaking different languages. Greek, in all likelihood, was
               the main language for official purposes throughout the history of the city and most
               inscriptions are in Greek. In addition, various <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref> language
               forms must have been spoken and written, although it has not been possible to
               pinpoint the local dialect of Dura. In the inscriptions of the synagogue, Jewish
               Aramaic is found, and the Palmyrene community of Dura used the Palmyrene Aramaic
               language and script. A few inscriptions are in Syriac, comparable to the
               non-Christian <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref> of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (most
               recently Bertolino, 54–8). In recent years Dura has received much scholarly attention
               for the ways in which different religious communities co-existed and interacted
               (Dirven; Elsner; Kaizer), while the exceptionally rich iconography of the Jewish
               synagogue has been studied in connection with early Christian art (Weitzman and
               Kessler).</p>
                    <p>Among the many important archeological discoveries there is a Christian assembly
               house with a baptistery annexed to it. The baptistery is decorated with wall
               paintings, representing scenes from the OT (e.g. Adam and Eve, David and Goliath) as
               well as from the NT (e.g. the Good Shepherd, Christ walking on the water,
               Resurrection scenes). Inscriptions are in Greek; a graffito from the courtyard,
               however, may be interpreted as a Syriac alphabet (Bertolino, 57). A unique Greek
               parchment fragment containing some verses of the <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref>
               provides a further reference to Christianity in this garrison town around the middle
               of the 3rd cent.</p>
                    <p>More significant for Syriac studies is the discovery, early in 1933, of a Syriac
               parchment (catalogued as P. Dura 28) describing the purchase made by a resident of
                  <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref> of a twenty-eight year old female slave from an
               Edessene lady. The transaction is dated in ‘the month of Iyyar, the year 554 by the
               former reckoning’ and in ‘the year 31 of the Freedom of ... Edessa ...’, which is AD
               243 (the Freedom of Edessa refers to the city gaining the status of a Roman <hi rend="italic">colonia</hi> in 213). This document bears witness to the use of
               Syriac as the language of official transactions in Edessa and its environs, in the
               middle of the 3rd cent. Situated outside the realm of Edessene Christianity, the
               language of this document is the continuation of the language used in inscriptions of
               Edessa and Osrhoene. Two more Syriac legal documents from the Middle Euphrates area,
               also dating from the early 240s, which came to light in the 1980s, provide further
               evidence to the use of Syriac for secular purposes (see <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac
                  documents</ref>).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Professor at the Collège de France of Paris, Syriac scholar. Paul-Rubens Duval was
               born on 25 Oct. 1839, as the son of the mayor of the town of Morsang sur Seine (Seine
               et Marne). His father, who loved the art of the Renaissance, wanted his son to become
               an artist and appropriately named him ‘Paul-Rubens’. The young man, however,
               preferred the study of law and received a law degree in 1860. While working at a
               lawyer’s office in Paris, he met with Edmond Drouin, with whom he began to study
               eastern languages as a pastime at the École Pratique des Hautes Études and in the
               Collège de France. In 1867, Duval quit his law position and went to Göttingen,
               Germany, where he studied for two years under the great biblical scholar and Semitist
               Heinrich Ewald, and where he also made the acquaintance of another well-known
               biblical scholar, Julius Wellhausen. Duval then traveled to the Middle East. He took
               part in the festivities surrounding the opening of the Suez Canal by the French
               Empress Eugénie and subsequently visited Palestine and the Syrian coast. Upon his
               return to France, he decided to devote himself entirely to the study of Semitic
               languages and particularly <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref>, with a special interest in
               lexicography and dialectology. His first publication dealt with the Aramaic dialect
               of Maʿlula (1879). In 1881 his <hi rend="italic">Traité de grammaire syriaque</hi>
               followed. This important grammar of Syriac, published one year after the first
               edition of <ref rend="bold">Theodor Nöldeke</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Kurzgefasste
                  syrische Grammatik</hi>(1880), came as a surprise, since Duval was not yet known
               as an authority in the field of Syriac studies. Between 1886 and 1893 he was an <hi rend="italic">auxiliaire</hi>of the French <hi rend="italic">Académie des
                  Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres</hi>, in charge of the preparation of the <hi rend="italic">Pars aramaica</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Inscriptionum
                  Semiticarum</hi>, an ambitious project aiming at the publication of all Semitic
               inscriptions. In 1895 the Collège de France recreated for him the chair that once had
               been occupied by the famous orientalist scholar Barthélemy d’Herbelot (1625–95) but
               was discontinued in 1770. In his capacity as professor of Aramaic language and
               literature at the prestigious Collège de France, Duval taught Syriac topics, which
               was his primary interest, as well as Targumic Aramaic. For reasons of poor health, he
               tried to obtain a substitute from 1904 onwards, but since he was unsuccessful in
               this, he continued teaching until 1907, when the condition of his health forced him
               to resign. He retired to the family house in Morsang sur Seine, where he died on 10
               May 1911. While his publications cover various subfields of Aramaic studies,
               including Neo-Aramaic dialects, Palmyrene, Nabataean, and Targumic lexicography, his
               major works are in the field of Syriac studies.</p>

                    <p>Maronite Patr. (1670–1704) and scholar. He was born on 2 Aug. 1630 in Ahden, and as a
               boy he was sent (in 1641) to Rome to study at the Maronite College. While in Rome he
               took the opportunity to collect historical materials on Maronite history. He returned
               home in 1655, and was ordained priest in 1656. In 1668 he was made bp. of Nicosia
               (Cyprus), and two years later was elected Patr. He died on 3 May 1704. Much of his
               prolific output, mostly in the fields of liturgical theology and history, was only
               published posthumously, or in some cases still remains in manuscript. His largest
               work, <hi rend="italic">Manārat al-aqdās</hi>, on the history and theology of the
               Eucharist, was published in <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref> in two vols., 1895–6. He also
               wrote on the orthodoxy of the Maronites, the history of the Maronite Church, a
               chronicle, and a history of the Maronite College in Rome (ed. <hi rend="italic">Mashriq</hi> 21 [1923], 209–216). His revision of the baptismal rite was
               published in J. A. Assemani’s <hi rend="italic">Codex Liturgicus</hi>, vol. III,
               187–90, and his Latin translation of various Maronite liturgical rites was printed in

                    <p>The 5th cent. witnessed much controversy over how best to describe the relationship
               between the divinity and humanity in the incarnate Christ while maintaining, on the
               one hand the transcendence of the Godhead, and on the other, the full reality of the
               incarnation.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The Origins of Division</label>
                    <p>In the second quarter of the 5th cent. two different approaches to christology
               emerged, usually referred to as ‘Antiochene’ and ‘Alexandrian’, after the locations
               of the leading theologians of each. Different concerns and starting points led to
               differences of emphasis on either side, giving rise to two different conceptions of
               how salvation for humanity comes about. For the Antiochenes, a concern for the
               transcendence of the divinity meant that it was important to maintain the distinction
               between the divinity and the humanity in the incarnate Christ (hence their dislike of
               ‘theopaschite’ language): for them, salvation for humanity was achieved by means of
               the humanity of Christ, raised up at the Ascension; as a result, it was important for
               them to call Mary ‘mother of Christ’ and not ‘mother of God’. By contrast, for the
               Alexandrians, salvation is brought about by the divine Word ‘becoming’, but without
               change, fully human at the incarnation. Thus for them it was essential to stress the
               ‘oneness’ in the incarnate Christ. For each side, the other side’s approach was seen
               at best as unsatisfactory, and at worst, heretical.</p>
                    <p>Successive Roman emperors attempted to get the issue resolved by convening a series
               of Councils, of which those at Ephesus (431) and at Chalcedon (451) proved to be the
               most important, and as matters turned out, the most divisive. At Ephesus, owing to
               the delayed arrival of the Antiochene bishops (under John, bp. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>), the Alexandrian bishops (under <ref rend="bold">Cyril</ref>, bp. of
               Alexandria) met by themselves and deposed <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref>, bp. of
               Constantinople, a leading proponent of Antiochene christology. When the Antiochene
               bishops subsequently arrived they held their own council, and condemned Cyril’s. Two
               years later, in 433, a compromise was reached (the ‘Formulary of Reunion’).
               Polarization of the different positions, however, continued, and in the course of
               this three technical terms became prominent in formulations of christology, above all
               at the Council of Chalcedon: person (<hi rend="italic">parṣopā</hi>; Greek <hi rend="italic">prosopon</hi>), nature (<hi rend="italic">kyānā</hi>; Greek <hi rend="italic">physis</hi>), and ‘hypostasis’ (<hi rend="italic">qnomā</hi>), the
               last two of which were understood in different ways by different people. According to
               the dogmatic Definition of faith laid down at Chalcedon, the incarnate Christ is
               ‘made known in two natures ... concurring into one person and one hypostasis’. This
               formulation gave rise to a sharp division between those who spoke of ‘two natures’ in
               the incarnate Christ (‘dyophysites’) and those who adhered to Cyril’s formula ‘one
               incarnate nature of God the Word’ (‘miaphysites’).</p>
                    <p>It was very largely the imposition, by Justin (518–527) and especially Justinian
               (527–565) of Chalcedon’s Definition of faith as the sole touchstone of orthodoxy that
               led to the three-way split in Eastern Christianity which is represented today by
               three separate traditions: 1. the Oriental Orthodox Churches, among which is the <ref rend="bold">Syr. Orthodox</ref>; these accept the Council of Ephesus of 431, but not
               the Council of Chalcedon; 2. the Churches which accept both the Council of Ephesus
               and that of Chalcedon (the various Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, and Reformed
               Churches); and 3. the <ref rend="bold">Church of the East</ref>, which does not accept
               either of the two Councils (since its adherents were largely outside the Roman
               Empire, the imperial councils did not directly concern them).</p>
                    <p>For both the Oriental Orthodox and the Church of the East the Chalcedonian Definition
               was seen as illogical, the former objecting to ‘in two natures’ and the latter to
               ‘one hypostasis’. The basic problem lay in different understandings of two of the
               terms used, ‘nature’ (<hi rend="italic">physis/kyānā</hi>) and ‘hypostasis’ (<hi rend="italic">qnomā</hi>): for the miaphysites ‘nature’ implied ‘hypostasis’ (and
               not <hi rend="italic">ousia</hi>), while for the Church of the East <hi rend="italic">qnomā</hi> meant ‘set of characteristics’, and not ‘hypostasis’. With these
               different understandings it can readily be seen that the Chalcedonian Definition was
               not satisfactory. Thus the miaphysites (Syr. and other Oriental Orthodox) insisted on
               Cyril’s ‘one incarnate nature’, while the Church of the East spoke of ‘two natures
               with their <hi rend="italic">qnome</hi>’ (where <hi rend="italic">qnome</hi> has the
               sense of ‘characteristics’ and not ‘<hi rend="italic">hypostaseis</hi>’). In an
               attempt to overcome the problem, the ‘Neo-Chalcedonians’ of the early 6th cent. held
               that either ‘in two natures’ or ‘out of two natures’ was acceptable (the latter,
               which had been in the draft of the Council’s Definition, was acceptable to the Syr.
               Orth.), but attempts at bringing about agreement by Justinian and others failed,
               though this was very nearly achieved under Heraclius in the early 630s with both the
               Syr. Orth. and the Church of the East. The Arab invasions, which followed shortly
               after, then fossilized not only the divisions, but also the misleading polemical
               names given by Chalcedonians to their opponents: ‘Nestorians’ (implying a belief in
               two sons, the Son of God and the son of Mary), ‘Eutychians’ (implying a belief that
               the Christ was not ‘consubstantial with us’, as well as ‘with the Father’), and
               ‘Monophysites’ (implying a Eutychian position) — positions which the Church of the
               East and Syr. Orth. have always strongly rejected. On every side the polemical
               literature became increasingly scholastic in character, although a few voices
               (notably that of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>) were to be heard, pointing out
               that underlying the conflicting doctrinal formulae there lay a consensus on the
               essential understanding of the incarnation. The general feeling of antagonism between
               Churches only became increased as a result of the creation of the Eastern Rite
               Catholic Churches (<ref rend="bold">Chaldean</ref>, 1553; <ref rend="bold">Syrian
                  Catholic</ref>, 1782), and of the various Protestant missions of the 19th cent.
               Though the help in educational matters given by different Western Churches benefited
               individual Syr. Churches, this never led to any real dialogue, and so matters
               continued largely unchanged until the late 20th cent. when ecumenical dialogue at
               last began to remove the fog of misconceptions on all sides.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Modern Dialogue</label>
                    <p>The aim of modern dialogue is not uniformity, but unity through the acceptance of
               variety. At the end of the very first meeting of the Oriental and Eastern Orthodox
               non-official dialogue, in 1964, the communiqué stated ‘on the essence of the
               Christological dogma we found ourselves in full agreement. Through the different
               terminologies used by each side, we saw the same truth expressed’. The four
               non-official dialogues were followed by an Official Dialogue, and at the end of the
               third meeting (1990) it was recommended that a mutual lifting of anathemas and
               condemnations should take place (this, however, still remains to be implemented). In
               1991 an important agreement on various practical matters was made between the Syr.
               Orth. and Rum Orth. Patriarchs of Antioch.</p>
                    <p>Dialogue between the Oriental Orthodox and Catholic Churches began in 1971 with a
               series of non-official meetings in Vienna initiated by the Pro Oriente Foundation.
               The very first meeting produced what came to be known as ‘the Vienna Christological
               formula’, which has played an important part in subsequent Official Dialogue. The 6th
               meeting of this Dialogue took place in Jan. 2009, with the theme ‘The Nature,
               Constitution and Mission of the Church’. Meetings also took place between the Syr.
               Orth. Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Yaʿqub III</ref> and Pope Paul VI in 1971, and
               between Patr. Ignatius Zakka I and Pope John Paul II in 1984. Each ended with a joint
               communiqué.</p>
                    <p>Beginning in 1994, Pro Oriente has arranged a series of non-official meetings
               entitled ‘Syriac Dialogue’, involving all the different Syr. Churches; these have
               proved most helpful in clearing away traditional misunderstandings, especially
               concerning the christology of the Church of the East. In particular it was soon
               recognized that ‘Nestorius’ (and hence ‘Nestorianism’) means completely different
               things to different people: to the Church of the East Nestorius is primarily seen as
               a leading figure, alongside Diodore and <ref rend="bold">Theodore</ref>, of the
               dyophysite cause, but to the Oriental Orthodox he is an arch-heretic who divided
               Christ into two sons, while to modern scholarship the real character of his
               christology is disputed and remains unclear. In any case, the theology of the Church
               of the East is far more under the influence of the writings of Theodore (in a
               modified form) than of those of Nestorius.</p>
                    <p>The Church of the East had at first been left out of the wider dialogue in the 1960s
               and 1970s, but in 1984 Patr. Mar Denḥa IV had an official meeting with Pope John Paul
               II in Rome, and ten years later, on 11  Nov. 1994, the two heads of Churches issued a
               historical Common Declaration of Faith. A further important event, in 1997, was the
               decision of the synods of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic
               Church to inaugurate moves to bring about the full ecclesial union of the two
               Churches; an important step towards this was the Vatican’s publication (26 Oct. 2001)
               of ‘Guidelines for admission to the Eucharist between the Chaldean Catholic and the
               Assyrian Church of the East’, which incorporated recognition of the legitimacy of the
               Anaphora of Addai and Mari in its original form, without any explicit Institution
               Narrative. Another momentous decision of the synod of the Assyrian Church of the East
               in 1997 was to lift unilaterally all anathemas against persons in other Churches whom
               they had traditionally regarded as heretical, thus setting an example for all other
               Churches. Unfortunately relations between the Church of the East and the Oriental
               Orthodox Churches (in particular the Coptic) have remained problematic, at least on
               the official level, and the Church of the East still has not yet been admitted as a
               member of the Middle East Council of Churches.</p>

                    <p>The town of Eddé lies in the foothills of Mount Lebanon, above the town of Batrun
               (Botrom). The church of Mar Saba, which nowadays is Maronite, is an imposing Crusader
               building from the 12th cent., with a wide central nave and side aisles, under a
               complicated system of rib vaulting. An open narthex with groin vaults adorns the west
               end. The interior of the church was cleaned of white wash only recently, and a few
               fragments of wall painting were exposed which are now being preserved.</p>
                    <p>On the northern wall, near the entrance, are two fragments of painting representing
               the Dormition of the Virgin. In this imposing scene, only a few of the apostles,
               angels, and <ref rend="bold">Dionysius the Areopagite</ref> can still be distinguished.
               An inscription above the Dormition was read by the Maron. Patr. <ref rend="bold">Isṭifān al-Duwayhī</ref>, in the 17th cent., where he gives the date of this
               painting as the Greek year 1573 (= AD 1261/2).</p>
                    <p>There are also a fine Crucifixion on the northern wall of the nave, above the arches;
               an imposing but very damaged painting of the Virgin in the position known as the
               Nikopoia, with the Christ Child held frontally on her lap; and the scant remains of
               several equestrian cavaliers and other saints.</p>
                    <p>The Virgin Nikopoia is inscribed in Greek and stylistically this painting belongs to
               the Syr. Orth. style of the 12th cent. The inscriptions of the Dormition, however,
               are in Syriac. In spite of the Syriac inscriptions, this Dormition shows a fine
               13th-cent. style that most closely follows the style of painting associated with
               Constantinople in the 13th cent. This style is unquestionably Byzantine and far
               removed from the Syr. Orth. style of other Lebanese paintings.</p>

                    <p>Modern Urfa, Syriac Urhay, and ancient Adme, on the Balikh river, to the northwest of
                  <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref> in southeastern Turkey. In ancient times Edessa was a
               caravan city on a trade route mentioned in Old Assyrian and Babylonian itineraries as
               Adme, Admi, and Admum, located beside Ḥarran. <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>associates
               Edessa with biblical Erech (the ancient Sumerian Uruk) ruled by the legendary Nimrod.
               Another source associates its name with its mythical first ruler ʾRHY BR ḤWYʾ,
               whereas Jewish and Islamic traditions conveniently turned the city into the dwelling
               place of Abraham. In 304 BC, Seleucus I Nicator rebuilt the ancient settlement into a
               Hellenistic polis, naming it after the Macedonian city of Edessa, possibly because
               both localities enjoyed plentiful water. The Syriac name <hi rend="italic">Urhay</hi>
               (Arabic <hi rend="italic">al-Rahhāʾ</hi>) may derive from the name Antiochia
               Kallirhoe ‘Antioch by the Kallirhoe’ inscribed on coins struck there by Antiochus IV
               Epiphanes (175–64 BC). The city became part of the small province of Osrhoene created
               after the defeat of Antiochus Sidetes in 130–129 BC at the hands of the Parthians.
               From this time the province enjoyed independence, being ruled by local kings (most of
               whom were named Abgar or Maʿnu) until AD 213 when it turned into a Roman colony (see
                  <ref rend="bold">Abgarids</ref>). Christianity spread out in Mesopotamia probably
               through Edessa, and in any case, its <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref> dialect attested in
               inscriptions, deeds of sales, and coins, became the language of Syriac Christianity.
               Edessa is the scene of Addai’s missionary activities according to the <ref rend="bold">Teaching of Addai</ref>, and it had a church destroyed in 201 by the flooding of
               the Daiṣan, the river that passed through the city. This is reported by the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, which drew on the royal archives of the city.
               During the 3rd and 4th cent. Edessa witnessed a diversity of Christian traditions
               including followers of <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Marcion</ref>,
               and <ref rend="bold">Mani</ref>, all contending with Roman ecclesiastical orthodoxy
               championed by Ephrem (d. 373). During most of the 5th cent. Edessa was the scene of
               struggles between ‘Nestorians’ and Miaphysites, opposing Bp. <ref rend="bold">Rabbula</ref> (d. 435), an archenemy of Nestorianism, and <ref rend="bold">Hiba</ref> (d. 457) who, while teaching at the <ref rend="bold">School of
                  Edessa</ref>, assisted in the translation of the works of <ref rend="bold">Theodore</ref> and other Antiochene theologians from Greek into Syriac. After
               succeeding Rabbula as bp. of Edessa, Hiba eventually anathematized both <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Eutyches</ref>, but the suppression
               of Nestorianism in the city occurred during the time of bp. Qiyore (d. 498), under
               whose instigation the ‘School of the Persians’ was shut in 489 by Zeno on account of
               its ‘Nestorian’ tendencies. During the 6th cent. Edessa suffered the consequences of
               warfare between Byzantines and Sasanians some of which are vividly recorded in the
               so-called Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Yeshuʿ the Stylite</ref>. In about 542 the city
               had a bishop named <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref> (d. 578), who, with the
               support of the Empress <ref rend="bold">Theodora</ref>, undertook the reorganization of
               the Miaphysite community in Syria into the Syr. Orth. Church that survives to this
               day. In 641 Edessa was conquered by the Arabs and in 1098 it became a Crusader
               principality to be crushed by Zengi of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> in 1144. The
               Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> contains a dramatic report of the
               massacres that accompanied the fall of the city and a lamentation over it was
               composed by <ref rend="bold">Dionysios Bar Ṣalibi</ref> bp. of <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>. From 1517 Edessa became part of the Ottoman empire, and during World
               War I some of its Syriac and Armenian inhabitants were massacred, a fact that led the
               remnants to leave the city once for all in 1924, heading to <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> where they still live in Hay al-Suryān ‘Quarter of the Syriacs’.
               Edessa was a Syr. Orth. Metropolitan seat probably from the early 6th cent. and as
               late as 1924.</p>

                    <p>The School of Edessa, or the School of the Persians in Edessa, as it is referred to
               by the earlier and more reliable sources, seems to have been one of several
               intellectual circles in 5th-cent. <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (‘Acts of the Council
               of Ephesus of 449’, ed. Flemming, 24.22–4). Its appellation and the background of
               those persons immediately associated with it in the sources suggest an originally
               ethnically-based institution, which in time, perhaps due to the influx of Christians
               from the East and the changing theological standards in the West, became the center
               of a more conservative Antiochene theology. The works of the so-called Nestorian
               fathers, such as <ref rend="bold">Diodore of Tarsus</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Theodore
                  of Mopsuestia</ref>, were translated by those associated with the school (as
               evidenced in Letter 14 of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>). The school was
               closed in 489 under the auspices of the bp. Qiyore by order of the emperor Zeno, at
               which (or slightly earlier) point its members migrated into the Persian empire, some
               of them, most notably <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>, founding the <ref rend="bold">School
                  of Nisibis</ref> (the date has been disputed in the secondary literature).</p>
                    <p>The standard view of the School of Edessa in modern scholarship has suffered from an
               uncritical reading of the sources and an anachronistic understanding of what kind of
               institution the term ‘school’ may have referred to in antiquity (e.g. Vööbus).
               Scholarship has attributed greater significance to the school than it perhaps
               deserves, arguing, for example, that commentaries on <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>
               were composed and studied therein (e.g., on <ref rend="bold">Proba</ref>, see Vööbus,
               104–5) and extending its history back to the time of <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>
               (d. 222) by using the title ‘School of Edessa’ more broadly to refer to intellectual
               activity in the city of Edessa in general (e.g. Hayes 1930; more recently, Drijvers
               1995). Furthermore, a tradition developed from early on that <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> taught in and even founded the school. All but one of the sources
               for the school derive from after its closure and thus reflect the ongoing controversy
               between the W. Syrians, for whom the school was a source of heresy, and the E.
               Syrians, who understood it as the intellectual predecessor of the School of Nisibis.
               The question remains unresolved as to how much continuity there was between the
               School of Nisibis and that of Edessa. The two richest sources for the School of
               Edessa, ‘The Cause of the Foundation of the Schools’ and the Ecclesiastical History,
               both attributed to a <ref rend="bold">Barḥadbshabba</ref> (perhaps the same person —
               the question of the identity of these two authors is not resolved), were composed at
               the School of Nisibis and describe the development of the school in the 5th  cent.;
               however, inconsistencies between these two texts suggest that their knowledge of this
               predecessor institution is hazy.</p>

                    <p>Monastic author of a verse biography of <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>
               (445–523), who had become the patron saint of the monastery of Qarṭmin (20 km.
               southeast of <ref rend="bold">Midyat</ref>). Nothing is known of the author, except
               that he is a member of the monastic community at Qarṭmin. References in the text
               imply that he was a priest and probably wrote the <hi rend="italic">mimro</hi> during
               the 13th cent.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">mimro</hi> survives in a single ms., Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr.
               377, ff. 219r–241v. The ms. was copied in 1855, belonging to <ref rend="bold">Addai
                  Scher</ref>, before being acquired by the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">mimro</hi> is a panegyric composed in honor of Philoxenos and
               read on the occasion of one of the three annual commemorations at the Miaphysite
               monastery of Qarṭmin (lines 343–8): 1. Ordination to the episcopacy, 18 August; 2.
               Death, 10 December; 3. Translation, 18 February.</p>
                    <p>The modern editor, André de Halleux, divides the <hi rend="italic">mimro</hi> into
               two parts: 1. (vv. 1–24) Introduction; (vv.  25–290) Life of Philoxenos; (vv.
               291–332) Passion and martyrdom of Philoxenos — suffocation in bathhouse at Gangra;
               (vv. 333–68) Translation of Philoxenos’s remains to Qarṭmin and Midyat; 2. (vv.
               369–410) Narrative of a posthumous miracle, dated 1144/5, when raiders attacked and
               pillaged <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, emptying the bones and head of Philoxenos
               on the road. A column of light appeared from the remains; (vv. 411–504) Elegy
               paralleling the life and achievements of Philoxenos with various Biblical characters;
               (vv. 505–550) Invocation to Philoxenos for patronage over Ṭur ʿAbdin; (vv. 551–4)
               Closing doxology.</p>
                    <p>De Halleux concludes that Eli’s biographical details are only as good as his sources
               from such a distance in time, and while there are numerous errors, Eli’s focus on
               Philoxenos’s relationship with Ṭur ʿAbdin deserves attention.</p>
                    <p>Philoxenos’s connection with Ṭur ʿAbdin is tied to three locations: 1. the monastery
               at Qarṭmin at Dayr al-ʿUmr where his body is interred; 2. the monastery of Mar
               Abraham, near Midyat, where his head was reputedly transferred in 1144/5; 3. Beth
               Severianos (Bāsebrīna), in the vicinity of which Philoxenos is said to have
               constructed a stone cell for himself (vv. 505–6).</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">mimro</hi> relates two significant events in the life of
               Philoxenos that connect him to Qarṭmin: the miraculous encounter with the stylite
               Abel when Abel’s column bent down to meet Philoxenos (vv. 99–118); and his
               correspondence with bp. Yuḥanon of Amid (vv.  231–54), both of whom were said to be
               fellow novices with Philoxenos at Qarṭmin. Both, according to de Halleux, while being
               problematic historically, give evidence of genuine encounters.</p>
                    <p>De Halleux appended a short <hi rend="italic">qolo</hi> on the martyrdom of
               Philoxenos, entitled ‘For the definition of the faith’ (ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr.
               165, f. 237v.), eight verses in Ephrem’s meter (two hemistichs of heptasyllabic
               verse). He also pointed out the possible connection of the <hi rend="italic">mimro
               </hi>with a biographical notice on Philoxenos preserved in ms. Vat. Syr. 155 (CSCO
               234, I n. 2).</p>

               he served as director twenty years later, when <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Beth
                  Rabban</ref> was temporarily removed from that position. Regardless, he was an old
               man when he became director, and his tenure was relatively short, 4 or 7 years.</p>
                    <p>Barḥadbshabba ʿArbaya ascribes to Elishaʿ an apologetic work written in response to
               criticism (<hi rend="italic">zeṭeme</hi>) by the Magi. This may be the same work
               which, according to the Chronicle of Siirt, Elishaʿ composed on the Christian
               religion and which Cath. <ref rend="bold">Aqaq</ref> translated into Persian before
               submitting it to the Persian emperor Qawad. The sources also mention didactic
               writings and biblical commentaries. The Chronicle of Siirt singles out commentaries
               on the Pauline letters, Job, Joshua, Judges, and Samuel (for which book Elishaʿ is
               said to have completed the commentary of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of
               Mopsuestia</ref>). None of Elishaʿ’s complete works survive, but two brief comments
               on Job are quoted by <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, under the simple name
               Elishaʿ. The Chronicle of Siirt also ascribes to him a book on ‘the cause of the
               setting of the <hi rend="italic">mawtbā</hi> (Arab. <hi rend="italic">al-mawtib</hi>;
               perhaps “academic session”) in the school’, a title that links the work to a
               well-known work by the author who is known as Barḥadbshabba of Ḥalwan (published by
               A. Scher).</p>

                    <p>Bp. of Ṭirhan; Cath., author. After having been bp. of Tirhan, Eliya was consecrated
               Cath. in 1028. Prior to becoming bp. he wrote his influential Syriac grammar, aimed
               at students accustomed to the system of grammars of Arabic. He also may be the author
               of three treatises on accents and diacritics. As Cath. he ordered the introduction of
               some new liturgical practices, such as the Service of the Genuflection (<hi rend="italic">Syām burkā</hi>) on Pentecost. He most likely is responsible for the
               final redaction of the great E.-Syr. <ref rend="bold">Synodicon</ref>, and he issued
               several canons in the field of hereditary law, possibly written in Arabic and
               translated into Syriac. Ṣalībā b. Yuhannā, the compiler of the theological
               encyclopedia <hi rend="italic">Asfār al-asrār</hi>, attributes to him a theological
               handbook in Arabic (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb usūl al-dīn</hi>), which, however, on
               the basis of internal criticism, must be the work of a later author.</p>

                    <p>Patr. (1917–32), and a local saint in Malankara. The son of a priest, he was born in
                  <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> and christened Naṣri. He worked as a shoemaker during
               his teens, then joined <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> in 1887. He became a
               monk in 1889 upon which he was renamed Eliya. He was ordained priest in 1892, and
               consecrated bp. of <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref> in 1908. In 1912, he was transferred to
                  <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> where he served until his election to the patriarchate
               in 1917. He held the <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>Synod in 1930. At the
               invitation of Lord Irwin, the British Viceroy to India, and appeals from the local
               clergy, Eliya visited Malankara in 1931 to resolve the dispute there, but died before
               completing his mission. He was buried outside of the Church of Mor Sṭephanos. Later,
               Dayro d-Mor Ignatius was built on the burial site. His tomb has become a pilgrimage
               center. At the recommendation of the local Malankara Synod, Patr. Zakka I issued a
               bull in 1987 granting permission to add Eliya’s name to the 5th Diptych, after the
               name of Mor Adai, along with the names of Maph. Yaldo and Bp. Gregorios of Parumala,
               effectively declaring him a local saint. This bull is published in <hi rend="italic">PatMagDam</hi> 26 (1988), 66–72; the corresponding bull bears no. E 265/87. His
               feast day is 13 Feb.</p>

                    <p>Author of a Life of <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Tella</ref>. No information about Eliya
               is available outside the Life itself. Eliya claims to have lived with Yuḥanon and, in
               addition, to have received information from Yuḥanon’s mother. He may, therefore, have
               been a monk from Kallinikos, like Yuḥanon himself. The Persian capture of the city in
               542, to which the author refers as the ‘rod of the Assyrian’ (cf. Is. 10:5), serves
               as the <hi rend="italic">terminus post quem</hi> for the composition of the Life.</p>
                    <p>The Life has been called ‘a masterpiece of Syriac literature, with a prose of elegant
               simplicity’ (Harvey, 34). In Europe it exists in three W.-Syr. mss.: Berlin Syr. 26
               (Sachau 321, 8th cent.), Brit. Libr. Add. 14,622 (9th  cent., incomplete), and Brit.
               Libr. Add. 12,174 (dated 1197, written for <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor
               Barṣawmo</ref>). It was first edited by H. G. Kleyn in 1882, on the basis of the two
               Brit. Libr. mss. (with DT) and again by E. W.  Brooks in 1907, using all three
               European mss. (with LT). A   fourth witness has been identified by Palmer in ms.
               12/18 of the Syr. Orth. Patriarchate in Damascus (late 12th  cent.).</p>
                    <p>Kleyn’s suggestion that Eliya might be identical with Eliya of Dara, whose life was
               written by <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> (but survives only very
               imperfectly), was rejected by Brooks for lack of evidence. Yuḥanon of Ephesus, in his
               ‘Lives of the Eastern Saints’, wrote a (much shorter) Life of Yuḥanon of Tella (ed.
               E. W. Brooks, in PO 18, 513–26), but this is quite different from Eliya’s; whether
               Yuḥanon of Ephesus knew and used Eliya’s work remains uncertain.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">al-Anbār</ref> and composer of didactic poetry in the first
               half of the 10th cent. There are three sources about his life and writings: 1. The
               ‘Chronology’ of <ref rend="bold">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (d. 1046) notes that Eliya was
               in (probably dogmatic) conflict with the Cath. Abraham III al-Abrāzā (906–37) in the
               year 1233 of the Greeks (= AD 921–22); 2. According to the ‘Book of the Tower’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-Majdal</hi>, ed. H. Gismondi) Eliya was ‘unique in his time
               by knowledge and virtue’ and elected Cath. in 938. But the Caliph’s approval was
               withdrawn after his secretary was offended by Eliya shortly before the
               inthronisation; 3. <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (d. 1318) in his
               ‘Catalogue’ of Syriac writers attributes to Eliya metrical discourses in three
               volumes, homilies, letters, and an apology. Moreover, Eliya of Nisibis claims that
               his ‘Chronology’ is a continuation of the one by Eliya, which he cites twice (286 and
               287 A.H.).</p>
                    <p>Only the discourses survived, a voluminous collection of didactic (heptasyllabic)
               poetry known as <hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-Durrāšā</hi> ‘Book of Exercise’ or by its
               popular name <hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-Maʾwātā</hi> ‘Book of Centuries’. The book is
               divided into three parts with a total of ten <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> and 3,000
               stanzas, organized in 30 centuries. It is a manual of ‘theoria’ based on scripture
               (typology), tradition (doctrine, heresies), and nature (profane knowledge), directing
               the reader to the Trinity, the world to come, and salvation history by unfolding
               symbols (<hi rend="italic">rāze</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ṭupse</hi>) and their
               explanations (<hi rend="italic">theoriai</hi>). The elaborate structure of the book
               reflects the celestial hierarchy of <ref rend="bold">Dionysius the Areopagite</ref>,
               enlarged by a tenth rank of the human beings. Purification, illumination, and
               perfection by participating in the knowledge of the angelic ranks is the mystical
               idea behind this symbolism.</p>
                    <p>There was a second E.-Syr. bp. of al-Anbār by the name of Eliya during the reign of
               Patr. Mari bar Ṭobi (987–99).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Metropolitan of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> and author. Eliya d-Ṣoba or bar Shinaya
               was born in Shenna (North Iraq) and studied in the St. Michael’s monastery near <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>. In 1002, he was ordained bp. of <ref rend="bold">Beth
                  Nuhadra</ref> and, in 1008, metropolitan of Nisibis. The majority of Eliya’s works
               were written in Arabic. His Chronography (<hi rend="italic">maktbānut zabne</hi>) is
               bilingual, Arabic and Syriac, and consists of two parts: Part I opens with lists of
               names of secular and ecclesiastical leaders, followed by a chronological series of
               mostly short entries on ecclesiastical and political events, covering the years AD
               25–1018, with careful indication of Syriac (East and West) and Muslim-Arabic sources.
               Part II consists of conversion tables of feasts and years according to different
               eastern calendars.</p>
                    <p>The report of his discussions with Abū al-Qāsim al-Maghribī, minister at the court of
               the Marwānids in Diyarbakır (see <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>), though written in
               Arabic, is important because of Eliya’s reflections on the <ref rend="bold">Syriac
                  language</ref> and culture. He tries to demonstrate the superiority of the Syriac
               language with a number of syntactical and lexicographical arguments as well as by
               referring to the fact that the Muslims have many scientific works translated from
               Syriac, whereas the Syrians do not have a single science borrowed from the Arabs. His
               argumentation is partly based on observations made by <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b.
                  Isḥāq</ref> in the 9th cent. and is no longer valid for his own period. His remark
               about the absence of translations of Arabic among the Syrians is contradicted by his
               chronicle which gives Syriac translations of fragments of Arabic historiographical
               works. He also argues that the Syriac <ref rend="bold">script</ref> is ‘more beautiful,
               accurate and useful’ than the Arabic script. We may have an example of his own Syriac
               handwriting in the only surviving ms. of his chronicle, ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add.
               7197, written as early as 1019. His interest in Syriac grammar — and the relation
               between Syriac and Arabic — also appears from his Syriac-Arabic dictionary and Syriac
               grammar.</p>
                    <p>Eliya of Nisibis was also active in the field of liturgical poetry, which became
               partly inserted into later liturgical compilations such as the ‘Abū Ḥalīm’ or the
               book of <ref rend="bold">Gewargis Warda</ref>. According to <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ of
                  Nisibis</ref>, Eliya is also the author of a no longer extant four-volume
               canonical collection in Syriac; the part on the law of inheritance is preserved in an
               Arabic translation by ʿUbaydallāh b. Bakhtishūʿ. His interest in canonical matters
               also appears from his Letter on the election of Cath. <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb
                  IV</ref>. Other letters, in Syriac and Arabic, ascribed to him by ʿAbdishoʿ of
               Nisibis, are lost.</p>

                    <p>Monk in the Upper Monastery (<hi rend="italic">Dayrā ʿellāytā</hi>) near <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, author of a Hexaemeron, which is still unpublished.
               Biographical data on Emmanuel are almost completely lacking. The Hexaemeron is a
               metrical work, partly in twelve- and partly in seven-syllable meter, on the creation
               of the world and on salvation history. In the 13  mss. of the work known today, 28
                  <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> are listed. However, the first <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> (Incipit: <hi rend="italic">urḥā ḥdattā</hi>) is also transmitted
               under <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>’s name (no. 81 in Macomber’s list) and most likely
               belongs to him. The second <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> is missing in all mss. It is
               only from the third <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> onwards, therefore, that Emmanuel’s
               authorship is well established. In the first part of the work (up to <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> 15), creation is described in great detail. Discussions
               on the creation of the angels, on original sin, punishment, and Sabbath rest are
               included, as well as a number of scientific digressions on anatomy, natural science,
               astronomy, and meteorology. The second part, consisting of <hi rend="italic">memre
               </hi>16 to 28, is more theological in nature and focuses on salvation and the New
               Adam. Excerpts from Emmanuel’s work are quoted in the 15th-cent. Prose Commentary of
                  <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq Shbadnaya</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The title ‘Book of the six days’ (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-eštat yawme</hi>) places
               this work in the longstanding tradition of Greek and Syriac writings on the
               Hexaemeron, the six days of Creation. The incorporation of data derived from secular
               sciences was a common characteristic of the later Syriac tradition, witnessed, e.g.,
               in <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>’s Hexaemeron. As an exegete and theologian,
               Emmanuel was familiar with the theological and exegetical views of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>; however, Narsai was his more direct model, not only
               as an early Syriac transmitter of Theodore’s teachings, but also as the main E.-Syr.
               master of the metrical homily. At the same time, Emmanuel should be seen as a
               representative of the E.-Syr. school tradition of his day.</p>
                    <p>Other compositions transmitted under Emmanuel’s name include a <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> on the sacrament of baptism (in the seven-syllable meter, ed. J.
               Ishaq, <hi rend="italic">Bayn al-Nahrayn</hi> 14.42 [1983], 33–66), and a Hymn on

                    <p>Monk and author. Originally from <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref>, ʿEnanishoʿ was a
               student at the <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref> with his brother Ishoʿyahb
               (later Bp. of Shenna) and with <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> (Cath. 649–59)
               before becoming a monk at the Monastery of Mt. Izla. After traveling to Palestine and
               sojourning in Egyptian Scetis, ʿEnanishoʿ settled in the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of
                  Beth ʿAbe</ref>. During his travels he became enamored with Egyptian monasticism
               and well acquainted with Greek texts. At Beth ʿAbe, he wrote a book on philosophical
               ‘definitions and divisions’, a lexical tool explicating difficult terms in patristic
               texts, and a ‘Book of Rules for Homographs’ (<hi rend="italic">Liber canonum de
                  aequilitteris</hi>), on words having the same consonants but different
               pronunciations and meanings. With Ishoʿyahb III he collaborated in revising the <hi rend="italic">Ḥudrā</hi>, the service book for the ecclesiastical year used by the
               Ch. of E. Cath. <ref rend="bold">Gewargis I</ref> (ca. 660–80/1) commissioned
               ʿEnanishoʿ to prepare the work for which he is most famous, the ‘Paradise of the
               Fathers’, a massive Syriac compilation incorporating Palladius’s ‘Lausiac History’,
               the ‘History of the Monks in Egypt’, and numerous apophthegmata of the ascetic
               Fathers. The ‘Paradise’ became a standard resource for ascetic spirituality in the
               Ch. of E. A commentary on it was written by <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref>
               (late 7th cent.).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>A monastic district southwest of Alexandria (Egypt) on the coastal road to Cyrene
               (Libya) which flourished esp. in the 5th to 7th cent. It was called ‘The Enaton’
               (i.e. ‘The Ninth’) after the ninth milestone from Alexandria (Greek <hi rend="italic">ennea</hi> ‘nine’). The Enaton served as a relay-post for travellers to and from
               Alexandria, to the monasteries of the Nitrian Desert, the Kellia, and the Scetis and
               shared in the permanent circulation of pilgrims, tourists, and merchants. A part of
               its own population was of international provenance. The district was a conglomeration
               of autonomous monasteries and cells of varying size and identifications of their own
               (e.g., the ‘Three Cells’ of Abba Zenon, the Monastery of ‘the Fathers’, of ‘Salomon’,
               of the ‘Antonines’). The ‘History of the Patriarchs’ (ed. B. Evetts [PO 1; 1948],
               472) gives the number of six hundred monasteries, which might rather be true for the
               total of monasteries in the region of Alexandria. A sort of federal constitution is
               reflected by the election of a common <hi rend="italic">hegumenos</hi> (in the ‘Life’
               of Longinus, ed. R. Basset [PO 11, 1916], 764–7).</p>
                    <p>The origins of the Enaton are shrouded in darkness. When Longinus became <hi rend="italic">hegumenos</hi> in the mid–5th cent., it had been in existence for a
               long time. His ‘Life’ presents him and the monks of the East as fervent opponents of
               the Council of Chalcedon (451), and this theological feature dominated in the time to
               follow (though ca. 542/3 there was a period when the monks of the Enaton followed the
               decisions of Chalcedon and received a theological tract from the Emperor
               Justinian  I). Miaphysitism was established in 453 when the monks of the monastery of
                  <ref rend="bold">Peter the Iberian</ref> at Maïuma/Gaza in Palestine were expelled
               and took refuge in the Enaton. Notable Miaphysite refugees were <ref rend="bold">Julian
                  of Halicarnassus</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> after his
               deposition (518), who died in Egypt (538) and was buried in the Enaton; and <ref rend="bold">Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref> (Bp. of Mabbug) together with <ref rend="bold">Pawlos
                  of Tella</ref> after the expulsion from their sees in 599. As the Coptic
               Miaphysite patriarchs could not reside in the Melkite (Chalcedonian) Alexandria, the
               Enaton was the appropriate place for them to stay (Peter IV, Damian).</p>
                    <p>The quasi-autonomous status of this monastic district in which the multi-national
               population intermingled with emigrants, expelled bishops, and fugitive patriarchs
               yielded a fertile milieu of theological controversy and negotiation. This milieu
               helped bring about a settlement, in 616, of the schism between the Coptic and Syriac
               Miaphysites (Maspero, ‘Histoire des Patriarches’, chap.  x), which dated from the
               time of Pope Damian (578–606) and the Patr. <ref rend="bold">Peter of Kallinikos</ref>
               (581–91). The Enaton is not expressly mentioned, but no doubt this location brought
               together the leaders Anastasios (Apozygarios, 607–619) and <ref rend="bold">Athanasios
                  I Gamolo</ref> of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> (594–631) who both had no access to
               Alexandria. This reunion was based on extensive philological work on the Holy
               Scriptures, which took place in the Enaton in the monastery ‘of the Antonines’ (cf.
               Honigmann, <hi rend="italic">Évêques</hi>, 238) and was favored by the vicinity of
               Alexandria with its philological traditions and resources. Pawlos of Tella provided a
               translation of the Septuagint (‘<ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref>’), and Tumo of
               Ḥarqel a translation of the NT (<ref rend="bold">Ḥarqlean version</ref>). According to
               the subscriptions of the Ḥarqlean Gospels (Hatch, <hi rend="italic">The
                  Subscription</hi>), Acts, and Pauline epistles this translation was executed ‘at
               the Enaton of (i.e. near) Alexandria, the great city, in the holy Convent of the
               Antonines (…) in the year 927 of Alexander, in the fourth indiction’ (i. e., 615/16),
               while the subscriptions of the ‘Syro-Hexapla’ refer to the progress of the work
               between 615/17 (Vööbus, <hi rend="italic">The Hexapla</hi>,36–44). Shortly after the
               completion of the translation work the Persians invaded Egypt and sacked the Enaton
               in 619. A visit of Alexandria is reported for <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>,
               who thoroughly revised the OT. The Enaton is not mentioned, but the location
               ‘Alexandria’ does not necessarily exclude this monastic district.</p>

                    <p>Deacon, poet, and theologian. Born probably of Christian parents in the early years
               of the 4th cent. in the region of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, he spent most of his
               life in Nisibis, serving a series of bishops (beginning with <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of
                  Nisibis</ref>, d. 338). As part of the peace treaty between the Roman and Persian
               Empires in 363, Nisibis was handed over to the Persians and the Christian population
               had to leave. Ephrem may have gone first to <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>, but ended up
               settling in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, where he spent the last ten years of his
               life. He probably died on 9 June 373. His biography, written perhaps 200 years after
               his death, is full of unreliable information (see <ref rend="bold">Ephrem, Life
                  of</ref>).</p>
                    <p>Ephrem’s genuine writings fall into four main categories, prose, artistic prose,
               stanzaic poetry (<hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi>), and 7+7 syllable couplets (<hi rend="italic">memre</hi>).</p>
                    <p>1. Prose: Commentary on Genesis and part of Exodus (ed. R. M. Tonneau, CSCO 152–3);
               Commentary on the Diatessaron (ed. L. Leloir, 1963, 1990), whose final editing was
               probably after his death; Commentaries on Acts and the Pauline Letters which only
               survive in Armenian translation; various works against <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Marcion</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Mani</ref> (ed. C.
               Mitchell and F. C. Burkitt, <hi rend="italic">Prose Refutations</hi>, I–II [1912,
               1921]).</p>
                    <p>2. Artistic prose: <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> on our Lord (ed. Beck, CSCO 270–1);
               Letter to Publius (ed. S. P. Brock, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>89, 1976); <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> on the signs performed by Moses in Egypt (ed. Overbeck,
                  <hi rend="italic">S. Ephraemi ... Opera Selecta</hi> [1865], 88–94).</p>
                    <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Madrāše</hi> (‘<hi rend="italic">Hymni</hi>’). Nearly 400 <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi> survive, using some 50 different metrical patterns,
               designated by their melody titles (<hi rend="italic">qāle</hi>). According to <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, Ephrem instituted women’s choirs to sing his <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi>. These are transmitted in collections of various sizes,
               and are all edited by E. Beck: on the Church (CSCO 198–9); on the Crucifixion (CSCO
               248–9); on Faith (CSCO 212–3); on the Fast (CSCO 246–7); against Heresies (CSCO
               169–70); against Julian the Apostate (CSCO 174–5); on the Nativity (CSCO 186–7); of
               the Nisibenes (CSCO 218–9, 240–1); on Paradise (CSCO 174–5); on the Resurrection
               (CSCO 248–9); on Unleavened Bread (CSCO 248–9); and on Virginity (CSCO 222–3).
               Collections attributed to Ephrem, but which largely contain <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi> that must be slightly later, are: on Abraham of Qidun and Yulyana
               Saba (ed. Beck, CSCO 322–3); on the Confessors (ed. Beck, CSCO 363–4); on Epiphany
               (ed. Beck, CSCO 186–7).</p>
                    <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Memre</hi> (‘<hi rend="italic">Sermones</hi>’). Since the
               seven-syllable metre, used by Ephrem, became known as the ‘meter of Mar Ephrem’, a
               large number of <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, certainly not by Ephrem, came to be
               attributed to him. The six <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> on Faith (ed. Beck, CSCO
               212–3) are definitely genuine. Of the four further collections of <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> edited by Beck (<hi rend="italic">Sermones</hi> I–IV, CSCO 305–6,
               311–2, 320–1, 334–5), only the following are considered by him to be genuine: I, 1–3;
               II, 1 (on Jonah and Nineveh) and the core of 4 (On the Sinful Woman, Luke 7); and IV,
               2 (perhaps). All the rest in these volumes date from times later than Ephrem; this
               also applies to <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> in Beck’s further volumes, CSCO 363–4
                  (<hi rend="italic">Nachträge</hi>) and 412–3 (on Holy Week). Only some excerpts
               from a collection of <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> on Nicomedia survive in Syriac, but
               a complete Armenian translation preserves it (ed. C. Renoux, PO 37, 2–3).</p>
                    <p>The dating of Ephrem’s writings, to before or after his move from Nisibis in 363, for
               the most part remains uncertain. Very probably composed before 363 are the <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> on Faith, the <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi> on Paradise,
               and at least most of the Nisibene collection (the first can be dated exactly, since
               it describes the flooding of the surroundings during the siege of Nisibis in 350).
               The <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi> against Julian must date from shortly after the
               emperor’s death in 363, during his Persian campaign. It would seem reasonable to date
               with confidence to his Edessan period those works which include references to
               Bardaiṣan (Prose Refutations, <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi> against Heresies);
               likewise the <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi> on Faith, many of which are concerned
               with the later developments of Arianism.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi> collections are preserved in 6th-cent. mss. (not
               always quite complete). This is fortunate since later mss. (almost all liturgical)
               provide only excerpts, often mixed in with later material; furthermore they attribute
               to Ephrem numerous poems which are certainly not by him (see <hi rend="italic">Studia
                  Patristica</hi> 33 [1997], 490–505). An important clue to the early transmission
               of the collections is provided by an early index of <hi rend="italic">qāle</hi> (ed.
               A. de Halleux, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>85 [1972], 171–99). Three of the six-volume
               Roman edition of Ephrem’s works (1732–6) provided the first printed edition of his
               works in Syriac (the other volumes contain texts in Greek). In the 19th cent.
               editions of further works were published by Overbeck (1865), Bickell (1866), and
               especially Lamy (I–IV, 1882–1902). These older editions are now almost entirely
               replaced, as far as genuine works are concerned, by the 20th-century editions of Beck
               and others (a guide to all these editions is given in <hi rend="italic">The Harp</hi>
               3 [1990], 7–29; in <hi rend="italic">S. Ephrem, un poète pour notre temps</hi>,
               281–307; and in the Russian Theological Encyclopaedia [under Ephrem]).</p>
                    <p>Ephrem was already known outside Syriac circles to <ref rend="bold">Epiphanius</ref>
               (‘Panarion’, 51.22.7: ‘the sage among the Syrians’) and to Jerome (‘On Famous Men’,
               115, written in 392), and translations of some of his works into Greek were soon
               made. Ephrem’s fame, however, led to a large number of Greek texts being attributed
               to him, only a few of which are really by him (and many are not even translations
               from Syriac); <hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 3905–4175 provides a guide to these.
               Translations were made from Greek into Latin, Slavonic, and other languages; those
               into Armenian, however, were directly from Syriac.</p>
                    <p>Ephrem was also a profound thinker, preferring to express his theological vision
               through poetry, rather than prose. Though his importance for the Christian tradition
               as a whole was recognised by Pope Benedict XV in 1920, when he proclaimed Ephrem to
               be a Doctor of the Universal Church, it is only in fairly recent years that his
               significance as a theologian has begun to be properly appreciated.</p>
                    <p>The iconographical tradition either depicts him as a deacon (thus on a 10th-cent.
               icon at <ref rend="bold">St. Catherine’s Monastery</ref>, Sinai), or (more frequently)
               as a monk, following the misleading 6th-century Life. A popular theme in Late
               Byzantine art was the Death of St. Ephrem.</p>
                    <p>The dates of his liturgical commemorations vary in the different Churches. Syr.
               Orth., Saturday of the 1st week of Lent (with St. Theodore); also 28 Jan. and 19
               Feb.; Maron., 27 Jan.; Ch. of E., Friday of 5th week after Epiphany (Syriac Doctors).

                        <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/13">Ephrem</persName> (d. 373) is universally acknowledged as the greatest writer in Syriac literary culture.<note/>

                        <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>(d. 373) is universally acknowledged as the greatest
               writer in Syriac literary culture. However, the earliest biographical notices of
               Ephrem did not emerge from the Syriac-speaking world, but were the work of Greek
               ecclesiastical historians (Palladius, Sozomen, <ref rend="bold">Theodoret</ref>) who
               created an image intended to conform to their own monastic-inspired ascetical values.
               The accounts they produced preserve practically no reliable information about Ephrem;
               rather, they are constructed from a stereotypical repertoire of anecdotes and stories
               intended to depict an ideal monk. Monasticism had not entered Syria in Ephrem’s time.
               His dedication to an evangelical life of chastity and service was based on the native
               Syriac institution of the <ref rend="bold">Bnay qyāmā</ref> ‘Sons of the Covenant’
               which flourished in the pre-monastic period of Syriac asceticism.</p>
                    <p>It is clear that the purpose of the early Greek biographical sketches of Ephrem was
               to confer legitimacy on him from the point of view of the Great Church of the
               Byzantine Empire, for example, by fictitiously associating him with <ref rend="bold">Basil</ref> the Great, Father of Byzantine monasticism, and with monastic
               foundations in Egypt. These fictional encounters tactlessly depict Ephrem as a social
               inferior and an unlettered country-bumpkin whose fondest desire is to be able to
               speak Greek. It is during Ephrem’s fictitious visit to Basil that his purported
               ordination to the diaconate takes place. By conferring clerical status on Ephrem, his
               teaching authority is legitimized and sanctioned. As a provincial, non-Greek-speaking
               culture with a history of independent thought and practice, Syriac-speaking
               Christianity represented a deviation from Byzantine imperial hegemony. By authorizing
               Ephrem, the Byzantine ecclesiastics who produced the Life brought him into the fold
               and legitimized the authority he possessed in native Syriac culture.</p>
                    <p>A historically and culturally accurate depiction of Ephrem is found in a <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> by <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> dedicated to
               Ephrem. The homily knows nothing of the severe ascetic depicted in the Life who shuns
               everyday life and disparages women as inferiors. On the contrary, it celebrates
               Ephrem for his moderation (<hi rend="italic">puršānā</hi>) and simplicity (<hi rend="italic">šapyutā</hi>), and remembers him precisely for his work among the
                  <hi rend="italic">Bnāt qyāmā</hi> ‘Daughters of the Covenant’.</p>
                    <p>The several ms. traditions of the Life of Ephrem are all based on three Syriac
               recensions which, in order of length are: ms. Vat. Syr. 117; ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat.
               Syr. 235; and ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 9384.</p>

                    <p>Christianity reached the Kingdom of Aksum, on the northern edge of the great
               Ethiopian plateau, by the reign of ʿĒzānā in the middle of the 4th cent. According to
               Rufinus (4th cent.), the introduction of Christianity was facilitated by a certain
               Frumentius from Tyre (later known in the Ethiopic tradition as Salāmā Kaśātē Berhān),
               who was ordained bp. of ‘India’ (i.e. Ethiopia) by <ref rend="bold">Athanasius of
                  Alexandria</ref>. In the 6th cent., the traveler Cosmas Indicopleustes reported
               that there were a large number of churches in Ethiopia as well as numerous bishops,
               martyrs, and monks. In time, Ethiopic Christianity became associated with the
               Oriental Orthodox Churches, which include the Coptic, Armenian, <ref rend="bold">Syriac
                  Orthodox</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Malankara Syriac Orthodox</ref>Churches, all of
               which accept the Councils of Nicea, Constantinople, and Ephesus, but reject the
               Council of Chalcedon (see <ref rend="bold">Ecumenical dialogue</ref>). Throughout its
               history, Ethiopic Christianity has had various contacts with Syriac Christianity. In
               general, the influence of Ethiopic Christianity on Syriac Christianity seems to have
               been rather limited, though it was certainly not non-existent. The influence of
               Syriac Christianity on Ethiopic Christianity, on the other hand, was more
               substantial. This influence can be divided into two basic time periods: the Aksumite
               Period (4th cent. – ca. 900) and the Solomonic Period (1270–1770).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The Aksumite Period</label>
                    <p>In the scholarly literature, a great deal of attention has been focused on possible
               Syriac influences on Ethiopic Christianity in the Aksumite period. Although
               Christianity reached Ethiopia in the 4th cent., the spread of Christianity throughout
               Ethiopia is traditionally attributed to the efforts of a group of foreign
               missionaries active in the late 5th to early 6th cent. These missionaries include the
               Ṣādeqān, Maṭāʿ, andespecially the so-called Nine Saints (see A. Brita, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 3, 1188–91). A number of scholars, including I. Guidi
               (1888, 33–4 with n. 1; 1932, 13–5) and especially C. Conti Rossini (1928, esp.
               155–65), have argued that these foreign missionaries originated from Syriac-speaking
               areas. Based on this connection, a theory was developed that attributed a great deal
               of Syriac influence to the development of Christianity in Ethiopia, including the
               introduction of monasticism as well as the translation of the Bible into Geʿez, the
               classical language of Ethiopic Christianity. The association of these missionaries
               with Syriac-speaking areas was based on three principal arguments, all of which have
               been seriously challenged in more recent scholarship.</p>
                    <p>First, it was argued that the personal names of the missionaries and the geographical
               names from which they are said to originate are of Syriac origin (Guidi 1888, 33–4 n.
               1; Conti Rossini 1928, 161). More recently, however, Marrassini (1990, 35–8; 1999,
               326–8) has shown that few, if any, of these names are actually of Syriac origin.</p>
                    <p>Second, it was proposed that the transcription of Greek names in Geʿez, especially in
               translations of the Bible, was based on the pattern of Aramaic (Guidi 1888, 33–34 n.
               1; Conti Rossini 1928, 156). Marrassini (1990, 39–41; 1999, 329–30) has, however,
               pointed out that this pattern is not restricted to Aramaic, but rather it is the
               typical way in which Greek is transcribed in Semitic languages.</p>
                    <p>The third argument adduced in favor of Syriac influence on Ethiopic Christianity in
               the Aksumite period involves Syriac loanwords in Geʿez. More than a century ago, Th.
               Nöldeke drew attention to a number of <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref> loanwords in
               Geʿez. Guidi (1932, 14) and especially Conti Rossini (1928, 155) argued that some of
               these Aramaic loanwords in Geʿez are more specifically of Syriac origin, e.g.
                  Geʿez <hi rend="italic">hāymānot</hi> ‘faith’ (often translating Greek <hi rend="italic">pístis</hi>) from Syriac <hi rend="italic">haymānutā</hi>. In an
               influential study, however, Polotsky showed that several of these Aramaic loanwords
               were not borrowed from Syriac, but rather from Jewish Aramaic, e.g. Geʿez <hi rend="italic">meṣwāt</hi>‘alms, charity’ (no such word exists in Syriac) and Geʿez
                  <hi rend="italic">ṭāʿot</hi>‘idol’ (Syriac has <hi rend="italic">ṭāʿyutā</hi>,which not only preserves the third root consonant <hi rend="italic">y</hi>, but means ‘error, mistake’). Further research by Ullendorff (1967,
               120–5), Witakowski (1989–90, 191–2; forthcoming), and Marrassini (1990, 38–9; 1999,
               328–9) has raised additional questions about some of the purported Syriac loanwords
               in Geʿez while at the same time suggested several new possible examples. In the
               current state of research, it can only be conclusively stated that Geʿez contains a
               number of Aramaic loanwords, some of which are certainly not Syriac, but others of
               which may potentially be Syriac. Before any meaningful historical conclusions can be
               drawn, an updated analysis of all the Aramaic loanwords in Geʿez is needed, taking
               into account recent developments in Aramaic dialectology as well as the increasingly
               robust methodology of contact linguistics.</p>
                    <p>In the end, the evidence for significant Syriac influence on Ethiopic Christianity in
               the Aksumite period is rather slim. Nevertheless, it does seem all but certain that
               there were contacts between Ethiopic Christianity and Syriac Christianity at this
               time, especially given that the Aksumite kingdom was involved in various power
               struggles with South Arabian kingdoms in the Arabian Peninsula, a place where
               Syriac-speaking Christians are known to have resided. In one instance of particular
               importance to contacts between Syriac and Ethiopic Christianity, the Aksumite <hi rend="italic">neguś</hi> Kālēb (fl. first half of the 6th cent.) intervened
               against the king of <ref rend="bold">Ḥimyar</ref> on behalf of miaphysite Christians
               who where being persecuted in <ref rend="bold">Nagran</ref>(see recently Nebes).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The Solomonic Period</label>
                    <p>Setting aside the problematic evidence of the Aksumite period, Syriac influence on
               Ethiopic Christianity can be firmly established for Geʿez literature from the
               Solomonic period. In this case, however, Syriac influence was almost always mediated
               by Arabic Christianity, which inherited a great deal from the Syriac heritage.</p>
                    <p>Alongside original compositions, Geʿez literature contains a significant body of
               translations which were made from Greek in the Aksumite period and from Arabic in the
               Solomonic period; there is little evidence for literary activity in the intervening
               time of the Zāg<hi rend="superscript">w</hi>ē dynasty (900–1270). In many cases, the
               Arabic literature was itself translated from Greek, Coptic, and Syriac. While there
               may be a few rare cases in which Syriac literature in Geʿez was translated directly
               from Syriac, in most cases Arabic was the bridge by which Syriac literature reached
               Ethiopic Christianity.</p>
                    <p>The Bible is the earliest piece of literature associated with Ethiopic Christianity.
               At least part of the Bible was already translated into Geʿez by the end of the 4th to
               the early 5th cent. as can be deduced from biblical quotations in the Aksumite
               inscriptions (Knibb, 46–54). Though there is now general consensus that the Geʿez OT
               and NT were both translated from Greek, a number of different <hi rend="italic">Vorlagen</hi>, including Syriac, have been proposed throughout the history of
               scholarship. A. Vööbus, for instance, argued that the Geʿez Gospels were translated
               from Syriac and then revised against the Greek text. It is now clear, however, that
               Syriac influence on the Geʿez Bible occurred at a later stage (probably in the 14th
               cent.) when the Geʿez biblical text was revised against a Syriac biblical text or,
               more likely, an Arabic version of a Syriac biblical text (see Knibb, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 1, 565 and more extensively Knibb 1999). Evidence of
               interest in the comparison of Syriac and Ethiopic biblical texts (along with Coptic,
               Arabic, and Armenian) is found in ms. Vat. Barberini Or. 2, a 15th-cent. polyglot
               Psalter in five languages, which was owned by a Syr. Orth. priest named Ṣalib (see S.
               Brock, <hi rend="italic">The Bible in the Syriac tradition</hi>[2nd ed. 2006],
               145).</p>
                    <p>Moving beyond the Bible, a number of Syriac-speaking authors appear in Geʿez
               literature. Two demonstrations by <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref> (fl. 336–45) are
               found in the Ethiopic tradition (see W. Witakowski, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>,
               vol. 1, 287). In 1906, F. M. Esteves Pereira published a Geʿez version of Dem. 5. In
               this text, the author is (incorrectly) identified as <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of
                  Nisibis</ref>, an attribution which is also found in the earliest Syriac ms. of
               Aphrahaṭ (London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,182; dated 474), as well as in the Armenian
               translation. In 1964, E. Cerulli published a text on the resurrection of the dead,
               which was subsequently identified as a portion of Aphrahaṭ’s Dem. 8 by T. Baarda.</p>
                    <p>A number of Geʿez texts are attributed to <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> (d. 373),
               including both homilies and prayers (a list is provided by Weninger, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 1, 331–2); it is, however, unclear whether any of
               these are among Ephrem’s genuine writings. Several homilies attributed to Ephrem are
               extracted in the <hi rend="italic">Hāymānota ābaw</hi>‘Faith of the Fathers’, which
               is a large compendium of patristic writings, synodical statements, and canons
               (unedited; see A.  Wion and E.  Fritsch, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 2,
               1073–5 and Graf). In addition, Ephrem is said to have composed the <hi rend="italic">Weddāsē Māryām</hi>‘Praise of Mary’ (ed. with FT Velat), a collection of hymns
               to Mary for each day of the week, which is found in Ethiopic Psalter mss. as well as
               in the <hi rend="italic">Meʿerāf</hi>, a liturgical text which forms part of the
               Divine Office. Due to his association with the <hi rend="italic">Weddāsē Māryām</hi>,
               Ephrem is usually depicted in Ethiopic iconography standing at the feet of an
               enthroned Mary (see Hammerschmidt and Jäger, 101–8). Ephrem also sometimes bears the
               sobriquet <hi rend="italic">labḥāwi</hi>‘the potter’ in the Ethiopic tradition,
               likely due to a conflation with <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun Quqoyo</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The legend of Abgar V Ukkama (see <ref rend="bold">Abgarids</ref>), which is found in
               Syriac in the <ref rend="bold">Teaching of Addai</ref>, exists in at least four Geʿez
               versions, two of which are associated with the <hi rend="italic">Taʾāmmera Iyasus
               </hi>‘The miracles of Jesus’(see Weninger, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 1,
               40–41 and especially Haile). Most of the <hi rend="italic">Taʾāmmera Iyasus
               </hi>consists of a translation of the Arabic Apocryphal Gospel of John(ed. with LT I.
               Galbiati, <hi rend="italic">Iohannis evangelium apocryphum arabice</hi>[1957]), which
               is itself based on a variety of sources, including the <ref rend="bold">Cave of
                  Treasures</ref> and the <ref rend="bold">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</ref> (see
               Witakowski 1995).</p>
                    <p>No less than twenty texts are attributed to <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (d.
               521) in the Ethiopic tradition (inventories are provided in W. Witakowski, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 2, 263 and Uhlig 1999, 13–16). A majority of these
               belong to the genre of <hi rend="italic">dersān</hi> ‘homily’, the Geʿez equivalent
               of Syriac <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi>. While only one of these homilies has thus far
               been edited (Uhlig 1999), it seems that many of them were translated from Arabic, and
               at least some may go back to Syriac originals. Others, however, were only ascribed to
               Yaʿqub in the Geʿez ms. tradition, e.g. the <hi rend="italic">Dersāna sanbat</hi>
               ‘Homily on the Sabbath’ (see Wurmbrand 1963). Interestingly, Yaʿqub’s<ref rend="bold"/>‘Homily on the death of Aaron’ formed the basis for the <hi rend="italic">Mota
                  Āron</hi>‘Death of Aaron’, a Geʿez text that is found not only in the literary
               tradition of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, but also in that of the Bēta Esrāʾēl (or
               Falāšā) (see Wurmbrand 1961). In addition to homilies, an anaphora, incipit ‘Stand up
               in the fear of the Lord’, is also attributed to Yaʿqub (ed. with GT Euringer), but
               again it is probably pseudonymous (see Hammerschmidt, 47–8).</p>
                    <p>A Profession of Faith attributed to <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref> (d. 578) is
               preserved in Geʿez in the <hi rend="italic">Hāymānota ābaw</hi>(ed. with GT Cornill;
               see J. Tubach, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 3, 261–2). This text is not extant
               in Syriac, but is found in Arabic (ed. with DT H. G. Kleyn, <hi rend="italic">Jacobus
                  Baradaeüs. De stichter der syrische monophysietische kerk</hi>[1882], 121–63),
               from which the Geʿez was translated.</p>
                    <p>Geʿez preserves the ‘Conflict of Severus’ by <ref rend="bold">Athanasios I Gamolo</ref>
               (d. 631) (ed. Goodspeed and Crum), which deals with the life of <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref>(d. 538). Though not extant in Syriac, this text is found
               in Arabic as well as in Coptic fragments. Several texts attributed to Severus also
               exist in Geʿez, some of which may ultimately derive from Syriac originals (see
               Witakowski 2004).</p>
                    <p>Several Syriac authors feature prominently in the <hi rend="italic">Maṣḥafa manakosāt
               </hi>‘Book of monks’, which is one of the central collections of Ethiopic monasticism
               (see A. Bausi, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 2, 997–9). This collection
               consists of three distinct texts, each of which is directly associated with at least
               one Syriac-speaking author. Included in the <hi rend="italic">Maṣḥafa manakosāt
               </hi>is the <hi rend="italic">Āragāwi manfasāwi</hi>‘Spiritual Elder’, which is the
               name by which the Ch. of E. mystical writer <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref>
               (8th cent.), or Yoḥannan Saba (‘Elder’), is known in Geʿez. The <hi rend="italic">Āragāwi manfasāwi</hi>was translated from an Arabic version of Yoḥannan’s
               original Syriac composition (see E.  Lucchesi, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>,
               vol.  1, 309–10). Another text found in the <hi rend="italic">Maṣḥafa manakosāt
               </hi>is the <hi rend="italic">Filkesyos</hi>(see Witakowski 2006; idem, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 2, 541–2). Though attributed to the Syr. Orth.
                  theologian <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>(d. 523), the <hi rend="italic">Filkesyos</hi> is actually a Geʿez version (via Arabic) of the
               commentary of <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref> (late 7th cent.) on the ‘Paradise
               of the Fathers’ by <ref rend="bold">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref> (7th cent.). ʿEnanishoʿ’s work is
               in turn a large compilation of monastic texts, which includes <ref rend="bold">Palladius</ref>’s ‘Lausiac history’, the ‘History of the monks in Egypt’, and
               various apophthegmata. The final book that makes up the <hi rend="italic">Maṣḥafa
                  manakosāt</hi>is the <hi rend="italic">Maṣḥafa Mār Yesḥaq</hi>‘The book of Mar
               Isaac’ (ed. with GT Berhanu; see S. Weninger, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 2,
               193–4). As the title suggests, this text is attributed to the famous Ch. of E.
               monastic author <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref> (late 7th cent.). More
               specifically, the <hi rend="italic">Maṣḥafa Mār Yesḥaq</hi> is a Geʿez translation of
               the Arabic collection attributed to Isḥaq. The Arabic version is in turn a
               translation from a Greek version of writings attributed to Isḥaq, which consists of
               most of the ‘First Part’ of the original Syriac writings of Isḥaq as well as four
               homilies by Yoḥannan of Dalyatha and an abbreviated version of the ‘Letter to
               Patricius’ by Philoxenos of Mabbug. Thus, although the <hi rend="italic">Filkesyos
               </hi>is incorrectly ascribed to Philoxenos, the <hi rend="italic">Maṣḥafa
                  manakosāt</hi> does still contain a text by this Syr. Orth. theologian. Outside of
               the <hi rend="italic">Maṣḥafa manakosāt</hi>, Geʿez monastic literature preserves a
               number of sayings attributed to Syriac-speaking authors, including Ephrem, Yoḥannan
               of Dalyatha, and Isḥaq of Nineveh, in various collections of apophthegmata (ed. with
               LT Arras 1963, 1967, 1984, 1986, 1988).</p>
                    <p>Geʿez biblical exegesis has also been influenced by Syriac-speaking authors,
               especially those belonging to the Ch. of E., such as <ref rend="bold">Aḥob
                  Qaṭraya</ref> (late 6th cent.?), <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Koni</ref> (fl. end
               of the 8th cent.), <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (d.  828), and <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> (fl. ca. 850). This contact was mediated by the Christian
               Arabic tradition, in particular the exegetical works of <ref rend="bold">Ibn
                  al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043), especially his <hi rend="italic">Firdaws al-naṣrāniyya
               </hi>‘The Paradise of Christianity’. In its Geʿez version, E.-Syr. biblical exegesis
               was transmitted to the Andemta commentary tradition (Cowley 1983, 1988). The Andemta
               commentaries contain a translation of the Geʿez biblical text into Amharic, the
               official language of present-day Ethiopia, as well as a wealth of traditional
               exegetical material (Psalms ed. with ET Stoffregen Pedersen; Hosea ed. with IT
               Andeberhan). Several anonymous Syriac exegetical homilies are also extant in Geʿez.
               The Syriac verse homily on Abraham and Sarah in Egypt (ed. with ET S. P. Brock and S.
               Hopkins, ‘A verse homily on Abraham and Sarah in Egypt: Syriac original with early
               Arabic translation’, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 105 [1992], 87–146), for instance,
               found its way via Arabic into Geʿez (ed. with FT Caquot), where it is attributed to
               Ephrem. Similarly, the Geʿez <hi rend="italic">Zenāhu la-Yosef</hi>‘History of
               Joseph’ (ET Isaac; an edition of the Geʿez is in preparation by the current author)
               ultimately derives (via Arabic) from a Syriac version, which is attributed to <ref rend="bold">Basil of Caesarea</ref> (see Heal; ed. M. Weinberg, <hi rend="italic">Die Geschichte Josefs angeblich verfasst von Basilius dem Grossen aus
                  Caesarea</hi> [1893]; S. W. Link, <hi rend="italic">Die Geschichte Josefs
                  angeblich verfasst von Basilius dem Grossen aus Cäsarea</hi> [1895]; K.  Heal, ‘A
               Missing leaf from the <hi rend="italic">Syriac History of Joseph</hi>’,
               forthcoming).</p>
                    <p>Finally, a number of Syriac individuals appear in Geʿez hagiographic literature. The
                  <hi rend="italic">Senkessar</hi> ‘Synaxary’, for instance, commemorates, among
               others, Abgar V Ukkama, <ref rend="bold">Barṣawmo</ref>, Ephrem (cf. Pérès), <ref rend="bold">Marutha of Maypherqaṭ</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>,
               and Yaʿqub of Nisibis (ed. with FT by various authors in PO; for full references, see
               Colin; ET Budge 1928). More developed hagiographic works, such as the Life of
                  Barṣawmo<ref rend="bold"/>(ed. with FT Grébaut), are also extant in Geʿez.</p>
                    <p>Among the many interesting aspects of this large body of Geʿez literature that is
               attributed to Syriac-speaking authors is the fact that several E.-Syr. authors are
               represented in the Ethiopic tradition, especially in texts related to biblical
               exegesis and monasticism. The appearance of these E.-Syr. authors is intriguing given
               that Ethiopic Christianity has throughout its history been dogmatically aligned with
               the Syr. Orth. Church, not with the Ch. of E. In some cases, a work by a Ch. of E.
               author seems to have been stripped of its distinctive E.-Syr. features before it
               passed into Geʿez. This is, for instance, the case with Ibn al-Ṭayyib’s ‘Commentary
               on the Gospels’, which is extant both in an original form as well as in an adapted,
               miaphysite version (ed. Y. Manquriyūs, <hi rend="italic">Tafsīr al-mašriqī</hi>
               [1908–10]; see Faultless), which served as the textual basis for the Geʿez
               translation. In other cases, however, it is less clear how Syriac-speaking authors
               belonging to the Ch. of E. found their way into Geʿez.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the Geʿez literature that is attributed to Syriac-speaking authors,
               there are a number of originally Greek works that passed through Syriac on their way
               to the Ethiopic tradition, again almost always with Arabic standing in between. This
               is, for instance, likely the case with the <ref rend="bold">Didascalia Apostolorum
               </ref>(ed. with ET Platt; ed. with ET Horner), the <ref rend="bold">Testament of our
                  Lord Jesus Christ</ref> (ed. with FT Beylot 1984), and several texts related to
               the <ref rend="bold">Alexander cycle</ref> (ed. with ET Budge 1896; see G. Lusini, in
                  <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 1, 195). Likewise, the Sayings of <ref rend="bold">Aḥiqar</ref> seem to have traveled through Syriac (and then Arabic) on their way
               to the Ethiopic tradition, where they are transmitted in late mss. of the <hi rend="italic">Maṣḥafa falāsfa ṭabibān</hi> ‘Book of the wise philosophers’ (see U.
               Pietruschka, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 2, 485–6). A similar trajectory is
               likely for the related narrative about Aḥiqar that is preserved in Geʿez (ed. with FT
               Schneider).</p>
                    <p>It is clear then that Geʿez literature from the Solomonic period, which includes a
               number of texts that are attributed to Syriac-speaking authors as well as texts that
               passed through Syriac on their way to Geʿez, provides an example of Syriac influence
               on Ethiopic Christianity. It must be stressed, however, that this Syriac influence
               was in most, if not all, cases mediated by Arabic Christianity.</p>
                    <p>The Syriac influence on Ethiopic Christianity in the Solomonic period can be
               explained by various points of contact. During the reign of Yekunno Amlāk (1270–85)
               at the beginning of the Solomonic period, it appears that a ‘Syrian’ became head of
               the Ethiopian Church, a position normally restricted to Coptic monks (see Tamrat,
               69–72). Though this seems to have been short lived, it clearly demonstrates a Syriac
               presence in Ethiopia at this time. Outside of Ethiopia, contacts between Ethiopic and
               Syriac Christianity occurred at various locations. Ethiopic monks are known to have
               lived in several monastic communities in Egypt alongside Syriac monks (in general,
               see O. Meinardus, in <hi rend="italic">EAe</hi>, vol. 2, 243–5). Both Syriac and
               Ethiopic monks also resided at the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref>
               (Cerulli, 1943–7, vol. 1, 148 and 151). In addition, contacts between Syriac and
               Ethiopic monks took place in <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>, where the various
               Christian communities were represented (Cerulli 1943–7). Finally, moving closer to
               the Syriac homeland, Ethiopic monks were present from the 13th cent. onwards in
               Lebanon and Syria, and some may have possibly played a role in the renaming of <ref rend="bold">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>(‘Monastery of St. Moses the Ethiopian’)
               (Cerulli 1943–7, vol. 1, 325–33; Cruikshank Dodd, 19–25; Kaufhold, 54–9).</p>

                    <p>The narrative concerning Euphemia and the Goth, set in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> of
               395/6, belongs to the genre of miracle stories connected with a shrine (in this case,
               the shrine of the local martyrs, Gurya, Shmona, and Ḥabib). It is transmitted in two
               Syriac hagiographical mss. (the older of which is of the 9th cent.), and is also to
               be found in Greek (ed. E. von Dobschutz, <hi rend="italic">Texte und
                  Untersuchungen</hi>, vol. 3 [1911], 37). The unknown author claims to have heard
               the story from the <hi rend="italic">paramonarios</hi> ‘custodian’ of the shrine. At
               the time of an invasion of the region by Huns, a Goth in the Roman army in Edessa was
               billeted on a widow (Sophia) and her daughter (Euphemia). The Goth wants to marry
               Euphemia and eventually bullies Sophia into allowing this. When the time comes for
               the Goth to leave Edessa and take his new wife with him, Sophia takes them to the
               Shrine of the Confessors and gets him to swear that he will not harm her daughter.
               Once they have left Edessa, it emerges that the man already has a wife, and he treats
               Euphemia as a slave girl. When Euphemia gives birth to a child, the Goth’s wife, out
               of jealousy, poisons it, but Euphemia succeeds in poisoning her with the remains of
               the poison that had killed her son. The wife’s family shut her up in a tomb,
               intending to kill her; Euphemia in her desperation prays to the Confessors — and
               miraculously finds herself the next morning by their shrine, safe and sound. When the
               Goth is sent back to Edessa, Sophia manages, with the help of bp. Eulogios (d. 387!),
               to get him arrested, and he is sentenced to death by the Military Governor, Addai
               (who is also attested in other sources). Whether or not the story has an actual
               historical basis, it no doubt reflects a not uncommon situation. It will have been
               put into writing (almost certainly in Syriac) by someone connected with the shrine of
               the Confessors, and probably around the mid 5th cent..</p>

                    <p>6. ‘Letter to Carpianus’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 3465), explaining the tables

               originally devised by Ammonius, but was considerably refined in Syriac (where the
               tables are found in many early Gospel mss.). The Syriac text is edited by P. Pusey

                    <p>According to ʿAbdishoʿ there was also a Syriac translation of Eusebius’s ‘Life of
               Constantine’, but this does not survive. In his ‘Preparatio Evangelica’ (not
               translated into Syriac) Eusebius quotes (VI.10.1–48) from a Greek translation of the
               ‘Book of the Laws of the Countries’, attributed to <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Bp. of the Syrian city of Emesa (<ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref>), author of homilies and
               biblical commentaries. A native of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> and contemporaneous
               with <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, Eusebius received a Greek education. He studied and
               worked in Caesarea (Palaestina), <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, and Alexandria, before
               becoming bp. of Emesa (shortly after 341). In the Greek tradition, Eusebius’s name
               somehow remained tainted with Arianism, which helps explain why his writings, all
               originally written in Greek, do not survive in direct transmission.</p>
                    <p>In addition to Eusebius’s homilies, a number of which exist in early Latin and
               Armenian translations, there is an Armenian translation of his commentaries on: Gen.,
               Ex., Lev., Num., Deut., Josh., Judges, 1–4 Kings (i.e. 1–2 Sam. and 1–2 Kings). Only
               the Gen. commentary is quite developed; the other books are dealt with very
               succinctly. Excerpts of the original Greek text have been identified in the Greek
               Catena tradition and in an exegetical collection (‘Epitome’) by Procopius of Gaza (d.
               ca. 538). Some of Eusebius’s works existed in a Syriac translation. <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> quotes Eusebius for his opinion that Hebrew was the first
               language. A much more important witness is <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, who
               quoted numerous passages from Eusebius’s commentaries, without, however, ever
               mentioning his name.</p>
                    <p>A specific feature of Eusebius’s biblical interpretation consists in the many
               quotations from ‘the Syrian’ (<hi rend="italic">ho Suros</hi>), i.e., the Syriac OT
               (along with the less numerous quotations from ‘the Hebrew’). Somewhat critical of the
               Greek Septuagint, Eusebius used the Syriac version to gain access to what he saw as
               the authentic meaning of the Hebrew original. These quotations from ‘the Syrian’ are
               an important witness to the early <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>.</p>
                    <p>As for Eusebius’s Christology, in addition to references in the sermons and — only
               rarely — in the commentaries, 33 passages explicitly attributed to him were included
               in the Florilegium that <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> added to his ‘Memre
               against Ḥabbib’ (ca. 482). Even though they were used by Philoxenos in support of his
               late–5th-cent. Miaphysite Christology and may not, therefore, give an unbalanced
               picture, there seems to be no reason to doubt their authenticity. As such, they
               provide further evidence of the existence of Syriac translations of Eusebius’s
               works.</p>

                    <p>His early life, of which hardly anything is known, was evidently as a monk, and then
               an archimandrite, in Constantinople where, by 448, he and his teaching evidently had
               an influential following. In Nov. 448 Eusebius bp. of Dorylaeum denounced his
               teaching to Patr. Flavian, and Eutyches was summoned to a synod which condemned him
                  (<ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>, ‘Church History’, II.2; Acts of Council of
               Chalcedon, First Session). He appealed to Pope Leo I (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi>
               5948) and to Dioscorus, presenting professions of faith in formulations that were
               considered acceptable (Leo’s reply also survives [<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 5953]).
               He was restored at the second Council of Ephesus (449), but under the new emperor
               Marcian he was condemned again at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and this time
               exiled. Exactly what his teaching really was is unclear (both at the time and today),
               but he was understood to have held that Christ is consubstantial only with the
               Father, and not with us — a position rejected by both miaphysites and
               dyophysites.</p>

                    <p>Greek monastic author originating from Pontus. After a short career in
               Constantinople, where he was befriended by <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>,
               he left for Palestine where he was converted to the ascetic life by Melania the
               Elder, and in 383 went on to Egypt where he spent the rest of his life as a monk.
               His extensive writings (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 2430–2482) were condemned in Greek
               at the Council of Constantinople (553), due to his speculative theories on cosmology
               and the Fall, developed from those of Origen. Though some of his monastic texts
               survived in Greek under different names and so his ascetic teaching remained
               influential, it is only in Syriac and Armenian translation that extensive writings
               are preserved under his own name. Only part of those in Syriac have yet been edited,
               the most important being the ‘Chapters on Knowledge’ (<hi rend="italic">Kephalaia
                  Gnostika</hi>), which survives in two forms, a widely read one in which the
               speculative elements had been modified, and (in a single ms.) an unexpurgated form.
               Several works are transmitted in two or even three translations, indicating their
               popularity.</p>
                    <p>Evagrius’s writings were very much appreciated and often quoted by Syriac monastic
               authors; <ref rend="bold">Babai the Great</ref> wrote an extensive Commentary on the
               Chapters on Knowledge (in the adapted version; ed. Frankenberg). In the 8th cent.
                  <ref rend="bold">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref> had knowledge of both forms of the ‘Chapters
               on Knowledge’, but considered the unexpurgated version to be an adaptation by some
               heretical reader. Another Commentary on this work was made by <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> (ed. Çiçek).</p>

                    <p>The Bible and its interpretation have always played a major role in the world-view of
               Syriac-speaking Christians. A great number of texts are preserved in which the Bible
               is retold or explained. Biblical interpretation is found not only in commentaries,
               but also in many other genres.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The Earliest Syriac Literature</label>
                    <p>The OT was translated into Syriac at a very early stage, probably even before the New
               Testament: though the Book of the Laws of Countries (see under <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>) quotes Gen. 9:6 in a form that stands closer to Targum Onqelos,
               the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> OT is already cited in <ref rend="bold">Tatian</ref>’s <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref> (written in the 170s; Joosten).
               Neither these works, nor any of the other texts written before the 4th cent. that
               have come down to us, is dedicated to the exegesis of the OT, though such
               compositions as the <ref rend="bold">Odes of Solomon</ref> and the Hymn of the Pearl
               (see <ref rend="bold">Acts of Thomas</ref>) may certainly have been influenced by it,
               for instance in the way they describe Paradise.</p>

                        <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref>’s twenty-three Demonstrations (between 337 and 345) are
               treatises based to a large extent on biblical quotations. Aphrahaṭ discusses issues
               that must have been important to his community, which lived in the Persian Empire. In
               addition to subjects such as faith, love, fasting, prayer, wars, conversion,
               humility, and death, he also wrote on themes which suggest that his community had to
               defend its position vis-à-vis Jewish groups or rather Judaizing tendencies within
               Christianity. Thus he discusses, among others, circumcision, Pesach, Sabbath, food
               laws, virginity, and sanctity. Although he wrote against the Jews, especially in his
               historical interpretation he used Jewish traditions. His spiritual interpretation is
               mainly typological.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> (d. 373) wrote a Commentary on Genesis and an Explanation
               of Exodus (he may have written commentaries on other books of the OT as well, as the
               monk <ref rend="bold">Severos</ref> and <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>
               claim, but this can no longer be ascertained). He retells the biblical narrative,
               while filling the gaps and trying to establish what happened and why. Method and
               content show a clear affinity with Jewish biblical interpretation; still, no Jewish
               sources known today are quoted. Although he himself would call most of his exegesis
               in these commentaries ‘factual’, he did aim at a refutation of Manichean and
               Marcionite interpretations. He seems less interested here in spiritual exegesis,
               though there are a number of passing references to Christ. By way of exception, he
               adds a spiritual interpretation to his factual (historical) exegesis of Gen. 49. In
               marked contrast to these commentaries, his <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> (homilies,
               mostly in verse) and <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi> (often translated as ‘hymns’)
               show a wealth of symbols. In the Hymns on Paradise (11.6–7) he explains that in
               addition to the factual meaning one should try to find the ‘hidden power’ of the
               plain terms, or ‘pale colors’, which God uses in order to communicate with human
               beings. In these hymns the horizon is not the end of the OT period, but the eschaton.
               Still, the commentaries and the poetic works remain connected through a common basis,
               formed by Ephrem’s factual interpretation as well as his theological interests.</p>
                    <p>The particular genre of Ephrem’s commentaries (close to that of the ‘rewritten
               Bible’) was not commonly followed by later Syriac exegetes, but his poetry became a
               great source of inspiration. In the 5th and 6th cent., and even later, many <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> and <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi> were written (see <ref rend="bold">Poetry</ref>), of which some were attributed to Ephrem. Most of these
                  <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>are sermons in verse, but some are rather narrative
               poems in which a biblical story is retold. A special form of <hi rend="italic">madrāšā</hi> is formed by the genre of the dialogue poem, in which two biblical
               characters speak in alternating verses. The oldest Syriac representatives of this
               ancient genre were indeed written by Ephrem himself, but many others are anonymous.
               In Greek numerous works survive under the name of Ephrem, but most of these are not
               authentic.</p>
                    <p>Not long after Ephrem, the anonymous author of the <ref rend="bold">Book of Steps</ref>
               uses biblical interpretation to teach about a perfect, ascetic way of life. The
               author has a number of ideas in common with Aphrahaṭ and Ephrem, but in contrast to
               them he does not incorporate Jewish traditions in his work. The <ref rend="bold">Cave
                  of Treasures</ref> recounts biblical history from the Creation to Pentecost. Its
               use of apocryphal traditions (e.g. on Adam and Eve) has led some scholars to assume
               an early date for this composition, but in its present state it certainly does not
               antedate the 5th cent. (Leonhard 2004). Though the author clearly used Jewish
               traditions, his reconstruction of history omits parts which are important for
               Judaism, such as the time of Moses.</p>
                    <p>Commentaries on Qohelet and Job are attributed to <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan
                  Iḥidaya</ref>. The latter is, however, a text translated from Greek (Van Rompay
               2006b). The Qohelet commentary, however, which was quoted by both East and West
               Syrians, could have well been written by Yoḥannan Iḥidaya in the first half of the
               5th cent. He paraphrases the text and discusses its historical setting and purpose;
               at the same time, he does not shun allegorical interpretation.</p>

               the Advent of Islam</label>
                    <p>The <ref rend="bold">School of Edessa</ref> played a pivotal role in the further
               development of the Syr. exegetical tradition. It was probably here that the works of
                  <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> (d. 428) were translated into Syriac.
               This Greek Antiochene theologian and exegete was one of the main sources of
               inspiration for the Dyophysites. Even during his lifetime his works were already
               studied in the School and his hermeneutic principles and terminology were taken over,
               together with his Christology and his view on history as a manifestation of God’s
               pedagogic interaction with humankind. A loyal follower of Theodore was <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref> (d. ca. 500), the author of many <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>
               discussing OT passages. He was head of the School of Edessa until he had to flee to
                  <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, probably around 471, where he became head of the
               newly founded <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref>. Narsai knew Theodore’s works
               very well, and almost totally and exclusively adhered to his views. Theodore was
               considered the Interpreter <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> by him as well as in
               the later E.-Syr. tradition.</p>
                    <p>The adoption of Theodore’s Christology and anthropology also met with resistance,
               however. The early miaphysite exegete and poet <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh
               </ref>(d. 521), for example, felt more at home with Ephrem’s views and those of
               moderate Alexandrians. Like Narsai, he mainly wrote <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>,
               many of which interpret the OT. Yet Yaʿqub and Narsai had more in common. First of
               all, they shared a common Edessene tradition. In addition, it seems that the
               miaphysite opposition to Theodore did not necessarily lead to the acceptance of the
               radical allegorizing trend of some Alexandrians, who were ready to abandon the plain
               sense of Scripture altogether. Though Yaʿqub and other Miaphysites protested against
               certain parts of Theodore’s thought, through their connections with the School of
               Edessa they were influenced by his exegetical method and sought to achieve a balance
               between the Antiochene ‘historical’ approach and spiritual exegesis. Early
               translations of the Antiochene exegete <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref> were also
               widely read by Miaphysites and Dyophysites alike.</p>
                    <p>From the 6th- and 7th-cent. E.-Syr. tradition we know names such as <ref rend="bold">Aḥob Qaṭraya</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Nathniel of Sirzor</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Ḥenana of Adiabene</ref>, but we have no more than fragments of their exegesis.
               We do know that there was a crisis connected to the latter, who directed the School
               of Nisibis from 572 to 610. Much of the background to this crisis is no longer clear
               to us. His Christological views were condemned at a meeting of bps. in 612. His views
               may also have been more accommodating toward allegorical interpretations of the OT.
               However, as Reinink (2010) has indicated, the popular statement that Ḥenana rejected
               Theodore’s exegesis in favor of that of John Chrysostom is an oversimplification. The
               main problem seems to have been that Ḥenana showed some openness toward sources other
               than Theodore of Mopsuestia.</p>
                    <p>The mid-6th-cent. Commentary on the Psalmsby <ref rend="bold">Daniel of Ṣalaḥ
               </ref>gives us insight into the developing miaphysite tradition. Its interest in the
               historical setting and purpose of each Psalm reminds one of the Antiochene approach
               of Theodore of Mopsuestia. On the other hand, his exegesis often leads to an
               allegorical interpretation, which becomes quite prominent in his commentary. As the
               Psalms were read daily in the monasteries, it was important to control their
               interpretation. Daniel supplied the miaphysite leadership with a commentary in the
               form of 150 coherent, self-contained homilies, which were ideally suited to this
               purpose. They helped shape his community’s doctrine but also addressed larger
               political issues. It is here that we find the first serious attacks on the position
               of the emperor (Taylor 2010).</p>
                    <p>As an alternative to the dyophysite use of Theodore of Mopsuestia, the Miaphysites
               used a wider selection of Greek Fathers. Long and short versions of commentaries by
               authors such as <ref rend="bold">Athanasius</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Cyril of
                  Alexandria</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nyssa</ref> have come down to us.
               It appears that the shorter ones constitute abbreviations of the longer ones, which
               date back to the 5th and 6th cent. <hi rend="italic">Terminus ad quem</hi> for the
               abbreviated versions of the three authors just mentioned is the so-called London
               Collection (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,168), which was composed probably in the second
               quarter of the 7th  cent. The London Collection consists of extracts from various,
               primarily Greek, authors in Syriac translation, forming a commentary on most of the
               OT and NT. It is a work of encyclopedic scope. It would seem that the compiler is
               offering miaphysite readers a digest of Greek material in a form that is meant to
               replace earlier Syriac material. He often quotes Athanasius, Cyril, <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Basil the Great</ref>, Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom; Ephrem and
                  <ref rend="bold">John bar Aphtonia</ref> are the only Syriac authors mentioned. The
               compiler took as the basis for his commentary the Syriac translation of the Greek
               biblical text of his sources as well as the <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref>.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The Later E.-Syr. Exegetical Tradition</label>
                    <p>Even though Theodore of Mopsuestia was known as <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
               Interpreter among the East Syrians, only fragments of the original 5th-cent.
               translations have come down to us. It seems that he was soon deemed too difficult to
               read. The simplification, explication, and defense of Theodore of Mopsuestia
               therefore formed a large part of the E.-Syr. exegetical efforts in the 8th and 9th
               cent. The witnesses to this process of simplification include some unedited
               question-and-answer collections attributed to Theodore himself, the Psalter
               commentaries of <ref rend="bold">Denḥa</ref>-Grigor and of ms. Sachau 215, and the
               works to be discussed presently.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>’s Book of the Scholion (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-eskoliyon</hi>), written ca. 792, explains problems in the form of
               questions and answers. It is in fact a systematic introduction to the entire E.-Syr.
               intellectual tradition. The author presents his work as an aid to understanding the
               commentaries of the Blessed Interpreter for those who have only just embarked on the
               study of his works. Theodoros bar Koni was indeed a very loyal follower of Theodore
               of Mopsuestia. One of his main sources must have been a collection of traditional
               material representing the common stock of E.-Syr. exegesis, in which problems in
               Theodore’s exegesis were dealt with, as well as objections against him.</p>
                    <p>Around the same time as Bar Koni, <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> wrote his
               Selected Questions on the entire Bible. This collection follows the biblical text
               without adding the kind of non-exegetical material that Bar Koni supplies. If these
               two authors used the same or a comparable collection of traditional exegesis at all,
               we must conclude that Ishoʿ bar Nun reworked this collection more thoroughly than Bar
               Koni did. The number of literal agreements between the two authors is very small.
               Another characteristic that sets Ishoʿ bar Nun apart from Bar Koni and Theodore of
               Mopsuestia is the use of the concept of <hi rend="italic">theoria</hi> in a way that
               most Antiochenes would denounce as allegory.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps the closest we can get to the exegetical collection that may have been used
               at least by Bar Koni is the anonymous Commentary on Genesis–Exodus 9:32 of the ms.
               (olim) Diyarbakır 22. Like Ishoʿ bar Nun’s Selected Questions, this work does not
               have the encyclopedic character of the commentaries by Bar Koni and Ishoʿdad. It
               presents itself as an independent, original commentary, though it is clear that its
               core goes back to Theodore of Mopsuestia. As the Diyarbakır Commentary is not
               reworked in the form of questions and answers, we are often — but not always — closer
               to the original words of Theodore.</p>
                    <p>In its present form the Diyarbakır Commentary covers only a very small part of the
               Bible (Gen.–Ex. 9:32), but Van Rompay (1977) has been able to show that this work
               formed the core of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>’s commentaries on these
               parts of the Bible (9th-cent.). Ishoʿdad added other material to this and also used
               Ishoʿ bar Nun. Even though Ishoʿdad may occasionally have had access to the original
               Syriac translations of Theodore of Mopsuestia’s works, his knowledge of the
               Interpreter was often mediated by the Diyarbakır Commentary and other sources. A
               unique feature of Ishoʿdad’s work is its use of authors that did not commonly belong
               to the E.-Syr. tradition, among whom are even the Miaphysites Severus of Antioch and
               Cyril of Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>The Diyarbakır Commentary also formed the basis of the so-called Anonymous Commentary
               on the Pentateuch. In ms. (olim) Diyarbakır 22 we find a version of the latter work
               which includes the rest of the OT as well. For the sections where the Diyarbakır
               Commentary is extant, the Anonymous Commentary summarizes Diyarbakır while adding a
               limited amount of material from other sources, including Ishoʿdad. One source almost
               identical to the Diyarbakır Commentary and another close to Ishoʿdad and the
               Anonymous Commentary were employed in the OT sections of the <ref rend="bold">Gannat
                  Bussāme</ref> (‘Garden of Delights’), together with fragments of the exegetical
                  <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> of <ref rend="bold">Aba II of Kashkar</ref>(d. 751).
               The <hi rend="italic">Gannat Bussāme</hi> is probably a 10th-cent. commentary on the
               pericopes read in the liturgy, arranged according to the liturgical year.</p>
                    <p>Ishoʿdad was probably also the main source for the Paradise of Christianity by <ref rend="bold">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (d. 1043), a commentary on a large part of the
               Bible. This E.-Syr. author wrote in Arabic and became the intermediary of the
               Theodorian tradition not only to other Christian-Arabic authors, but also to <ref rend="bold">Ethiopic Christianity</ref>. A different voice is heard in <ref rend="bold">Eliya of al-Anbār</ref>’s Book of Instruction (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā
                  d-durrāšā</hi>; 10th cent.), in which a number of OT passages receive allegorical
               interpretations. In contrast to him, his contemporary <ref rend="bold">Emmanuel bar
                  Shahhare</ref>’s Hexaemeron is inspired by Narsai, even in the form of the work,
               which consists of 28 <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The last two E.-Syr. works to be mentioned, <ref rend="bold">Shlemon of Baṣra</ref>’s
               Book of the Bee (13th cent.) and <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq Shbadnaya</ref>’s Poem on the
               Divine Economy (15th cent.), discuss the entire history of salvation in prose. These
               works contain much exegetical material, while the latter author also adds a prose
               commentary with quotations from the earlier exegetical tradition.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The Later W.-Syr. Exegetical Tradition</label>
                    <p>As we have seen above, in the 7th cent. W.-Syr. exegesis was very much dominated by a
               number of Greek authors who were read in Syriac translation. The great polymath <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub</ref> of Edessa (d. 708) and his followers adopted many of their
               interpretations. He is not only the author of a revision of the Peshitta, but he also
               wrote a Commentary in short on the Octateuch (Kruisheer), a large number of Scholia,
               a Commentary on the Hexaemeron, and a number of letters of exegetical content. The
               works of Athanasius, Cyril, and Gregory of Nyssa were thus ‘Syriacized’ in three
               stages: after the full translation, an abbreviated version was produced; finally
               later Syriac authors such as Yaʿqub<ref rend="bold"/>wrote their own commentaries using
               either the shorter or the full version, and appropriating interpretations often
               without indicating their sources. Though the 7th cent. was the heyday of the very
               precise and literal mirror translations, at the same time a movement began that aimed
               to make the main exegetical texts more accessible and especially more compact.</p>
                    <p>The OT part of the Commentary by the monkSeveros (written in 861) likewise represents
               the movement just mentioned. Severos’s work consists, as he himself states, of a
               commentary on difficult words of the OT, based mainly on Ephrem and Yaʿqub of Edessa,
               and a commentary on the NT, based mainly on John Chrysostom. There are a number of
               longer additions in this text, and in addition Shemʿun, the scribe of ms. Vat. Syr.
               103, added a number of marginal comments. The biblical text quoted is that of the
               Peshitta, and for the OT, the number of explicit references to Greek exegetes (most
               of which were added by Shemʿun rather than Severos) is low. All in all, the work
               seems to be the opposite of the London Collection: this is the best of Syriac
               exegesis on the authentic Syriac Bible, with rather limited use of Greek sources.
               This fits very well with the atmosphere among the Syr. Orth. in the 8th and 9th
               cent., when Greek learning had become less popular and even suspect.</p>
                    <p>From the period of Severos, one should also mention the work of <ref rend="bold">Mushe
                  bar Kipho</ref> (d. 903), which also builds on predecessors, including Yaʿqub of
               Edessa. He must have written a commentary on most of the Bible, but on the OT mainly
               a Commentary on the Hexaemeronand a Commentary on Psalms have survived.
               Interestingly, he also quotes ‘Theodore the Nestorian’.</p>
                    <p>The 10th and 11th cent. show little activity in the field of W.-Syr. exegesis. It was
               not until the period of the <ref rend="bold">Syriac Renaissance</ref> in the 12th and
               13th cent. that <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref> compiled new exegetical collections. These works lean on earlier
               collections, but also show evidence of further ‘cultivation’ and ‘pruning’ of the
               tradition. A notable feature, for instance, is Bar ʿEbroyo’s openness toward the
               E.-Syr. tradition. After the 13th cent., hardly any new material was added to the
               W.-Syr. exegetical tradition.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Conclusion</label>
                    <p>Syriac biblical interpretation shows a unique richness of metaphors and depth of
               spirituality. At the same time, its typological and symbolic interpretations are
               usually based on an explanation of the plain sense, answering the simple questions of
               what happened and why. Based on a long literary tradition Syriac-speaking Christians
               developed their own genres, both in prose and poetry. Yet from its very beginning
               Syriac exegesis has also shown openness to other traditions. Ephrem already knew
               about different versions of the biblical text, and the use of alternative readings
               would remain a feature of many later Syriac commentaries. He and his contemporaries
               also used Jewish exegetical traditions. In the 5th cent. Greek interpretations were
               taken over that may have appeared more precise and systematic than the earlier Syriac
               tradition, but they were actually quite similar in terms of their general approach to
               the biblical text. Greek sources became so popular that the exegetes of the 6th and
               7th cent. even seem to have lost sight of the earlier Syriac tradition.</p>
                    <p>The balance was redressed, however, after the 7th  cent., paradoxically when Arab
               rule gradually began to weaken the position of the Syr. Churches. In this period,
               their members started editing anthologies and summaries of earlier exegetical
               literature. In the process of sifting, selecting, and summarizing, choices were made
               and new elements were added. Thus they built authoritative interpretative traditions
               that helped to give answers to questions posed by the political and religious
               circumstances of the period. Though the translation of Greek texts in the 5th cent.
               can be associated with the split between the Syr. Churches, later exegetes would also
               recognize the common ground formed by the teaching of Ephrem and the Cappadocians, by
               the Antiochene interpretation and method of John Chrysostom, and by philological
               comments, even if they originated with their doctrinal opponents. Some of the
               existing collections have assumed canonical status themselves, and are fostered and
               studied to the present day.</p>

                    <p>Syriac-speaking Christians, like Christians and Jews of every generation, have
               employed various exegetical strategies for interpreting their biblical canon. Their
               exegetical literature includes not only prose commentaries but also hymns, verse
               homilies, dialogue poems, treatises, commentaries on the lectionary cycle of biblical
               readings, and the Syriac versions of the NT. The astute biblical insights of early
               writers, such as <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of
                  Serugh</ref>, were extolled by subsequent authors who recycled their ideas in
               later prose commentaries. Since most Syriac authors were rarely explicit about their
               hermeneutical approach, their methods for interpreting the Bible are uncovered by
               studying their works.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Early Syriac Literature</label>
                    <p>The history of the reception of the NT in the Syriac-speaking world begins with the
               Syriac translations of the Greek text of the Gospels. These translations introduced
               (or perhaps preserved) interpretations of the Gospels that are no longer found (or
               were never found) in the Greek text. For example, <ref rend="bold">Tatian</ref>’s <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref> (2nd cent.) reports that John the Baptist (Mark 1:6)
               consumed milk and honey (not locusts and wild honey), which links his diet to the
               foods of the Promised Land (Deut. 6:3). The Old Syriac Gospels (<hi rend="italic">Ewangelion da-mparrše</hi>), also known as the <hi rend="italic">Vetus Syra</hi>,
               report that Barabbas was imprisoned for murder and <hi rend="italic">heresy
               </hi>(Luke 23:25 [Curetonian]), a reading that may allude to the theological
               controversies at the time of this translation. Much of early Christian Syriac
               literature, though not explicitly exegetical, is in dialogue with the NT. The elusive
                  <ref rend="bold">Odes of Solomon</ref>(2nd cent.), a group of 42 liturgical poems (a
               few of which are also known in Greek and Coptic), show traces of early
               interpretations of the NT, such as the extended meditation on the virgin birth of
               Jesus in Ode 19. In the ‘<ref rend="bold">Acts of Thomas</ref>’ (3rd cent.), the
               apostle Thomas sprinkles his farewell discourse with phrases from the NT allowing
               scholars to observe how these NT verses were interpreted in early Syriac
               Christianity. Particularly important for the author of the ‘Acts of Thomas’ were
               passages that promoted an encratic lifestyle such as Matt. 5:3 and 5 (ch. 94), 6:34
               (ch. 28), and 11:29 (ch. 28 and 86).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Aphrahaṭ and Ephrem</label>
                    <p>
                        <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, who called himself a ‘student of Holy Scriptures’
               (Dem.22, §26), composed twenty-three ‘Demonstrations’(337–45) that rely heavily on
               the Bible (he cites the NT approximately 700 times). Reading the Bible as an integral
               book, he illustrates its integrity through numerous ‘exemplary sequences’ (Murray
               1977) in which characters from the NT find their precursors in the OT. He can focus
               on particular passages, as in the Fifth Demonstration (‘On Wars’), which is an
               exegesis of Dan. 2, 7, and 8. His exegesis is driven by a concern for practical
               questions of Christian life, such as prayer, fasting, humility, and the relations
               between Jews and Christians. For this reason, he exhorts his audience to put biblical
               precepts into practice: ‘My friends, it is not sufficient that we learn to read the
               books of God [i.e. the Bible], rather, we must do them!’ (Dem. 14, §32).</p>
                    <p>The first running Syriac commentary is Ephrem’s ‘Commentary on the Diatessaron’ (4th
               cent.), most of which survives in Syriac. He also wrote commentaries on the Acts of
               the Apostles and Paul’s letters (surviving in Armenian). Like most Syriac
               commentators, Ephrem does not remark on every verse, rather, employing a close
               reading of the text, he explains difficult verses and unravels conundrums. He
               distinguishes between the factual (or historical) and spiritual interpretations. The
               former focuses on the details in the biblical passage, the persons involved, and
               their historical circumstances, while the latter seeks to uncover the eternal truths
               within the text (Brock 2006). Aphrahaṭ (Dem. 5, §25 and Dem. 22, §26) and Ephrem
               (Comm. Diat.<hi rend="italic">,</hi>ch 1,18–9) would agree that while the factual
               interpretation of the Bible is essential, the sacred text permits innumerable
               spiritual interpretations. Ephrem can use his exegesis to engage in polemics against
               his adversaries such as the Marcionites, the followers of <ref rend="bold">Mani</ref>,
               and those he calls Arians in order to defend Nicene orthodoxy (Shepardson).</p>
                    <p>Like Aphrahaṭ, Ephrem interprets the Bible as an integral text: comparing and
               contrasting different scenes of the Bible, especially between the Old and New
               Testaments. Events in the OT prefigure (*<hi rend="italic">ṣwr</hi> and *<hi rend="italic">rmz</hi>) NT events and terms such as <hi rend="italic">rāzā</hi>
               ‘symbol’ or ‘mystery’, and <hi rend="italic">ṭupsā</hi>‘type’ are used to penetrate
               the meaning of such events. These <hi rend="italic">rāze</hi>, or ‘mysteries’, are
               not enigmas or inscrutable quandaries; the term <hi rend="italic">rāzā</hi> is
               already found in Dan. 2:17–9 which reports that Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, along with
               its meaning, was a <hi rend="italic">rāzā</hi>, the significance of which could only
               be revealed by God. The <hi rend="italic">rāze</hi> drawn from nature prompt the
               believer to contemplate the divine. Thus, Ephrem teaches his audience how the natural
               characteristics of the olive tree illuminate the mystery of Christ (<hi rend="italic">rāz mšiḥā</hi>; Comm. Diat.<hi rend="italic">,</hi> ch. 21,11).</p>
                    <p>Also in the 4th cent. dramatic dialogue poems, many of which are anonymous (though
               they are sometimes ascribed to <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>), pictured imaginary
               exchanges between two biblical characters. One such poem extends the conversation
               between Mary and the angel Gabriel in order to draw out the theological implications
               of the annunciation and Mary’s role in the economy of salvation.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Fifth and Sixth Century Exegesis</label>
                    <p>By the mid-5th cent., the works of the Antiochene exegete, <ref rend="bold">Theodore of
                  Mopsuestia</ref> (d. 428), had been translated into Syriac. Theodore opposed the
               allegorical interpretation of the Alexandrian school in favor of a literal sense that
               takes into account the historicity of the passage and places less emphasis on the
               Christological interpretation of the OT (his ‘Commentary on the Gospel of
               John’survives in Syriac). When emperor Zeno closed the <ref rend="bold">School of
                  Edessa</ref> for its adherence to Theodore’s theology (489), the school was
               reestablished at <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, just inside the Persian border, under
               the direction of Narsai (d. ca. 500). The establishment of this school would lead to
               distinct E.- and W.-Syr. exegetical traditions. Narsai wrote over three hundred verse
               homilies (<hi rend="italic">memre</hi>) in many of which he recast particular
               biblical passages, including several Gospel parables, with dramatic style. His
               exegesis has much in common with Theodore’s: events in the OT must be seen in their
               context before they are considered as types for NT events.</p>
                    <p>Yaʿqub of Serugh (d. 521), though schooled in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> in the
               dyophysite Christology with Narsai, resisted Antiochene exegesis and the Chalcedonian
               formula. Like Narsai, he composed verse homilies (<hi rend="italic">memre</hi>) in
               metered couplets of 7 + 7 or 12 + 12 on biblical topics. He engaged the Bible with a
               close reading in which he explored the meaning of a single verse or word in
               relationship to other passages from the entire biblical canon (similar to Ephrem).
               Thus, when David selects rocks to sling at Goliath (1 Sam. 17:40), Yaʿqub sees the
               rock as Christ, a reference to 1 Cor. 10:4 in which Paul alludes to Ex. 17:6 and Num.
               20:7–13 (David and Goliath; <hi rend="italic">Memrā</hi> 34). This complex
               interrelationship among four biblical verses illustrates how, for Yaʿqub, the Bible,
               an integral text, is best interpreted through an intertextual, typological
               approach.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The E.-Syr. Exegetical Tradition</label>
                    <p>Adhering to the E.-Syr. tradition of Theodore of Mopsuestia and Narsai, <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Koni</ref> (8th cent.), a teacher at the school in
               Kashkar, wrote the ‘Book of the Scholion’ (792) which comprises 11 <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, four of which treat the NT. This work consists of questions and
               answers (a format well-known in E.-Syr. exegesis; Griffith 1982, 59) on individual or
               collections of biblical books. The NT chapters discuss the Gospels, the Acts of the
               Apostles, and difficult passages in Paul’s Letters. His hermeneutical approach is
               explicitly typological: words and events in the OT are types and allegories for
               Christ’s salvific role in the NT. His exegesis seeks to defend the doctrines that
               were of interest to Theodore of Mopsuestia and the E.-Syr. exegetical tradition,
               though he also quotes <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref> and Origen.</p>
                    <p>In the mid-9th cent., <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> wrote commentaries on
               most of the NT, integrating the works of previous authors including Ephrem, <ref rend="bold">Basil of Caesarea</ref> and the Cappadocians, John Chrysostom, and
               several unknown sources. He adhered to the exegetical approach of Theodore of
               Mopsuestia. The <ref rend="bold">Gannat Bussāme</ref>is an anonymous, lengthy
               commentary that compiles E.-Syr. exegetical traditions according to the cycle of
               biblical texts in the liturgical year. Its date is disputed; it may be as early as
               the 10th cent. It includes texts from Ephrem, <ref rend="bold">Gregory of
                  Nazianzus</ref>, and especially Ishoʿdad of Merv. The writings of several E.-Syr.
               exegetes are only known through quotations in the <hi rend="italic">Gannat
                  Bussāme</hi>. This repository of exegetical traditions influenced successive
               generations of Syriac authors.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The W.-Syr. Exegetical Tradition</label>
                    <p>The W.-Syr. tradition steered closer to the exegetical approach of Alexandrian
               exegetes, the Cappadocians, and John Chrysostom. A contemporary of Yaʿqub of Serugh,
                  <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> (d. 523) wrote Gospel commentaries
               (surviving in fragments). Because he viewed the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> as
               unsatisfactory for theological argumentation, he initiated a new translation of the
               Greek NT into Syriac (known as the Philoxenian version of which only fragments
               survive) that included the Minor Catholic Epistles and Revelation. His commentaries,
               in which he focuses on the plain sense and context of a passage, are closer to
               polemical homilies than to a verse-by-verse exegesis (McCullough, 19–21). Much of the
               works of <ref rend="bold">Mushe bar Kipho</ref> (d. 903), who commented on the entire
               Bible, have been lost, though his commentaries on John, Luke and Acts along with part
               of the commentary on Matthew survive. He stands at the crossroads of W.-Syr.
               exegesis: as a compiler who brought together earlier exegetical traditions and as one
               who would influence later Syriac authors. <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>
               (d. 1171), who knew Mushe bar Kipho’s works, wrote commentaries on the entire NT. His
               aim was to summarize the exegetical insights of previous authors, though his main
               source may have been Ishoʿdad of Merv (McCullough, 83). Finally, in 1277 the polymath
                  <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (d. 1286) completed his ‘Storehouse of
               Mysteries’, a collection of exegetical remarks on the entire Bible that reaches back
               into Syriac exegetical tradition to quote Ephrem, Yaʿqub of Serugh, Philoxenos, and
               even the E.-Syr. writer Ishoʿdad of Merv, though he was largely dependent on
               Dionysios bar Ṣalibi.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Conclusion</label>
                    <p>The Bible has held a central place in Syriac literature as this brief history of the
               reception of the NT demonstrates. Early Syriac writers such as Aphrahaṭ, Ephrem, and
               Yaʿqub of Serugh knew the Bible well, having committed much of it to memory, and
               their writings witness to a close reading of it. They focused on the factual or
               historical sense of a passage and then perceived the <hi rend="italic">rāze</hi>
               ‘mysteries’ within it that could give rise to spiritual interpretations. Syriac
               exegesis came under the increasing influence of the Greek Fathers. A century and a
               half after Ephrem, Philoxenos of Mabbug insisted on a new translation of the NT that
               was closer to the Greek. A century after that <ref rend="bold">Tumo of Harqel</ref>
               revised the Philoxenian version (AD 616) mirroring the Greek text in Syriac at the
               expense of good Syriac idiom. But even as more Greek authors were translated into
               Syriac, later Syriac writers continued to revere the works of their cultural
               ancestors, such as Ephrem and Yaʿqub of Serugh, reprising their exegetical insights
               for successive generations including our own.</p>

               Safar and was given the baptismal name Naʿʿūm (he gave himself the nickname Fāʾiq).
               He studied in the local schools, and then taught from 1888 to 1912 at various
               community schools, mostly in Diyarbakır, but also for short periods in al-Bsheriyyeh,
                  <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, Adıyaman, and <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref>. He witnessed
               the horrific massacres of 1895 in Diyarbakır. Fāʾiq was ordained a deacon in 1889 by
               Ignatius Peṭros III/IV. In 1908, after the Young Turk Revolution, he established in
               Diyarbakır the Jamʿiyyat al-Intibāh (known in Syriac as ʿIrutho), and shortly
               thereafter the newspaper <hi rend="italic">Kawkab Madenḥo</hi> (1910–12, 43 issues),
               published in Syriac, Garshuni Arabic, and mostly Garshuni Turkish. He immigrated to
               the USA in 1912 where he lived in NJ. There, he established the newspaper <hi rend="italic">Beth Nahrin</hi> (1916–21), and later became the editor of <hi rend="italic">Ḥuyodo</hi> (Union) for one year (1921–22, 39 issues), an organ of

                  Nahrin</hi> (1922–30). He contributed to other periodicals such as <hi rend="italic">Intibāh</hi> (NY, ed. Gabriel Boyaji), <hi rend="italic">Murshid

               (Diyarbakır, ed. Basshār Ḥilmī). According to his biographer, he wrote many books in
               Arabic and Turkish which remain unpublished, but it is not clear how many are in

                    <p>His Syriac writings include:</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>A region in southwestern Iran, often identified as the heartland of the Iranian
               people. Known as Anshan in Elamite texts, the region received the name Fars in the
               mid 7th cent. BC, following the migration of Persian-speaking tribes from the
               northern Zagros Mountains (de Planhol 328). Under the Sasanian Empire (224–642), the
               region reclaimed its role — established under the Achaemenids — as the epicenter for
               Persian royal ritual and building. Early Sasanian rulers honored the ‘holy places’ of
               their ancestors with new cliff reliefs and multilingual inscriptions and established
               ambitious urban foundations, such as Bishapur and Firuzabad, in the broad highland
               basins of the region’s interior (Wiesehöfer 336).</p>
                    <p>Christianity arrived in Fars via at least two major channels between the 3rd and 4th
               cent. Deportees from Roman Syria, forcibly resettled in the region by Shapur I (r.
               240–72) and his grandson Shapur II (r. 309–79), included Christians who maintained
               their faith even after some of them intermarried with the local ‘Persian’ population.
               E.-Syr. martyr literature, chronicles, and archaeology preserve scattered echoes of
               these deportees’ background in Roman Syria (Jullien and Jullien 153–87). Commercial
               contacts with northern Mesopotamia provided the other major conduit for the
               introduction of Christian doctrines into Fars. The <ref rend="bold">Acts of Mar Mari
               </ref>(a 7th-cent. apostolic narrative) claim, for instance, that merchants from Fars
               and Khuzistan traveled to the ‘West’, where they were converted by ‘the blessed
               apostle Addai’, presumably at <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, before returning home. The
               region’s earliest churches were thus diverse in both their origins and ethnicity.
               According to a plausible report in the 11th-cent. Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref> (ed. Scher, I.I [PO 4], 222, ch. 2), the liturgy in 3rd-cent. Fars
               was conducted in both Greek and Syriac.</p>
                    <p>During the 5th–6th cent., the Christian community of Fars emerged as one of the most
               important eparchies of the Ch. of E. The region’s metropolitan bp., based in the
               coastal city of Rev Ardashir, signed as the sixth highest ranking bp. at the synod of
                  <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>in 424 (Fiey 178–9). Other regional cities,
               such as Darabgard, Ardashir Khurrah (possibly to be identified with medieval Siraf),
               and even Istakhr (where the Sasanian dynasty was founded), had also attained
               episcopal status by this time (idem 202–3). The bishops’ names, more often Persian
               than Syriac, hint at the growing influence of ethnic Persians, whose conversion
               sparked a wave of translations, beginning in the 6th cent., from Syriac into Middle
               Persian. The demand for these translations was heightened by the links between Fars
               and the Persian-speaking population of adjoining regions, especially the dioceses
               scattered around the periphery of the Persian Gulf. According to a well-known passage
               in the Chronicle of Siirt(ed. Scher, II.I [PO 7], 117, ch.  9), Maʿna, metropolitan
               bp. of Fars in the mid-6th cent., produced Persian ‘hymns, homilies, and responses to
               be sung in church’, and distributed them to ‘the maritime lands (<ref rend="bold">Beth
                  Qaṭraye</ref>) and India’. It appears that the metropolitans of Fars even
               appointed clergy for the most far-flung merchant communities of the Indian Ocean. The
               6th-cent. pepper merchant of Alexandria, Cosmas Indicopleustes, was amazed to find
               clergy appointed ‘from Persia’ (<hi rend="italic">dia Persidos</hi>) on the island of
               Socotra near modern Somalia and at Kalliana on the south-western coast of India
               (‘Christian Topography’ 3.65; Weerakkody 237 and 244).</p>
                    <p>In the late Sasanian and early Islamic period, the metropolitan bishops of Fars
               entered into a prolonged and bitter conflict with the E.-Syr. patriarchs. The
               patriarchal correspondence of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> documents the growth
               of this rivalry that culminated in the synod in 676, which raised the provinces of
               Beth Qaṭraye and India to metropolitan status, thus removing them from the authority
               of bishops of Fars. Despite this truncation of its jurisdiction, Fars remained the
               base for a vigorous Persian Christian culture deep into the Islamic period. Christian
               law books produced in Fars in the 8th and 9th  cent. reveal not only the depth of
               Christians’ adoption of Sasanian-derived marriage patterns, but also the determined
               efforts of the clergy to purge their flock of these ‘Magian’ habits (Payne 191–241).
               Synodical lists continue to name bishops for the region into the 12th  cent. — and
               indeed as late as 1318 at the port city of Siraf.</p>
                    <p>In contrast to the range and depth of these textual references, the archaeology of
               Fars has not yet yielded any clear physical evidence for the region’s Christian
               communities. This lacuna probably reflects the biases of modern research conditions
               more than a lack of archaeological potential, since parallel fieldwork in the Persian
               Gulf has identified the remains of churches at at least eight sites, including a
               large 9th-cent. monastery (123 x 88 m) on the island of Kharg, only 50 km northwest
               of ancient Rev Ardashir (Carter 97–8; Steve 85–154).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Elias Fatḥallāh was a Syr. Orth. priest from <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>. Following his
               conversion to Catholicism in 1770, he moved to the Vatican, where he worked as an
               interpreter for Pope Pius VI and published a second edition of the Syriac Breviary in
               1787, based on the first 1696 edition of Athanasius Safar of <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>, to which he added the Sunday office. From 1793 to 1798, he held the
               chair of Syriac and Chaldaic at the Collegio de Propaganda Fide. Recruited there in
               1798, he became Napoleon’s interpreter and a member of the Commission des Sciences et
               des Arts as the director of the Oriental section of the press during the Egyptian
               Campaign. He is referred to as ‘Don Elias Fatalla’ in Napoleon’s correspondence dated
               16 Oct. 1798. He is also once mentioned as the interpreter of General
               Thomas-Alexandre Dumas, the father of the famed author of <hi rend="italic">The Three
                  Musketeers</hi>. Western biographers of Bonaparte are not aware of his Syriac
               heritage, nor do Eastern biographers know of the Napoleonic episode. Among the
               former, he is sometimes confused with Elias Pharaon, a younger Melk. interpreter from
                  <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>, called back to France at Napoleon’s request in
               1802. Among the latter, Tarrazi confuses him with Elias Amīrkhān, another Syr. Cath.
               priest from Amid and the chorepiscopos of the Mar Behnam Syr. Church in Cairo, an
               erroneous account frequently repeated thereafter. Further inaccuracies, such as the
               report attributing his conversion to the exhortations of Michael Jarweh, the bp. of
                  <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> and future Syr. Cath. Patr., may be explained by the
               desire of early Syr. Cath. historiography to embellish the storyline of this
               patriarch, who reestablished in 1782 the Uniate patriarchal line started in 1662 and
               interrupted since 1702. As a matter of fact, Fatḥallāh became Catholic four years
               before Jarweh, and no reference is made to the Patr. in the introduction to his
               breviary. Two Armenian-Turkish letters exposing the grievance of the Armenian widow
               Hripsime and addressed to the Doge of Venice, signed and sealed in attestation of
               content by, among others, his brothers Khawājas Isḥāq Niʿmatallāh and Maqd. Bishāra
               Fatḥī and the Chald. Patr. Yawsep IV in Amid in 1782, are now preserved in the
               private collection of the Fathi family (Aleppo). That his family was then leading the
               Catholic party in Amid may be inferred from a Garshuni epistle addressed by the Amid
               community to Patr. Jarweh in Mardin on 25 Feb. 1782, regarding the adoption of the
               Catholic mass, in which the names of his father, Khawāja Fatḥallāh son of the deacon
               Amīrchāh, also known as Fatḥī, and his two aforementioned brothers appear first among
               some seventy four civilian signatories. This letter, today at the <ref rend="bold">Sharfeh</ref> Monastery, was also signed by eleven Syr. priests, reflecting the
               early inroad made by the Syr. Cath. movement in Amid, supported by the local presence
               of the Chald. patriarchate and Capuchin monks. Catholicism had much less success
               here, however, than in Aleppo or <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, as resistance to it was
               fierce, since the city was the frequent residential abode of Syr. Orth. patriarchs.
               In 1810, Khawāja Mikhāyil Fatḥī Zadeh obtained a <hi rend="italic">firman</hi>
               establishing the Catholic bp. Behnam as Patr. at <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  al-Zaʿfarān</ref>, in a last attempt to catholicize the entire Syr. church. This
               attempt was later aborted by the Orthodox party, and the split of the Syrians into
               two churches has persisted to the present day.</p>

                    <p>French historian of the Syriac Churches. Born at Armentières in northern France, he
               studied for the priesthood at the Dominican Seminary at Le Saulchoir, outside Paris.
               After his ordination in 1938 he was sent to Iraq where he spent over three decades
               (1939–73) at the Dominican House in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>. It was as a result of
               living in Iraq that his interest in the history and topography of the Syriac
               communities of the region was aroused. Ironically it was soon after his being granted
               Iraqi citizenship that he was expelled from the country (1974). He moved to Beirut,
               and then spent a short period living in Cairo, but returned to Beirut, despite the
               outbreak of the civil war, in order to be closer to the Syriac tradition which he so
               much loved; he remained in Beirut for the rest of his life.</p>
                    <p>His first major publication (1959) was a historical guide to the ancient churches of
               Mosul, but it was his three-volume <hi rend="italic">Assyrie chrétienne</hi> which
               established him as the leading authority on the topographical history of the Syriac
               communities of Iraq. In his next book, <hi rend="italic">Jalons</hi> (1970) he set
               out to supplement J. Labourt’s classic <hi rend="italic">Le christianisme dans
                  l’empire perse sous la dynastie sassanide (224–632)</hi>, of 1904, in those areas
               where more recent publications had shed new light. His doctoral thesis (Dijon, 1972),
               on the dioceses of the Maphrianate (covering from its inception in 629 to 1860), was
               published in <hi rend="italic">Parole de l’Orient</hi> 5 (1974) and 8 (1977–8).
               Having dealt in <hi rend="italic">Jalons</hi> with the pre-Islamic centuries he then
               turned to a monograph (1975) on the Mongol period, and only two books later did he go
               back in time to cover the Abbasid period (1980), concentrating on the patriarchal
               line. The intervening monograph <hi rend="italic">Nisibe</hi> (1977) returned to
               topographical history, this time of a particular diocese. While producing these books
               he was also publishing a large number of important articles, usually on historical
               topography, and a small (but very useful) selection of these was reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Communautés syriaques</hi> (1979). The title of his repertory of E.-
               and W.-Syr. dioceses (1993) deliberately reflects the three-volume <hi rend="italic">Oriens christianus</hi> by his fellow Dominican predecessor, Michel le Quien,
               which was published posthumously in 1740; this represents the fruits of Fiey’s work
               over some three decades, and serves as an invaluable work of reference, as well as
               the fundamental starting point for all future, more detailed, studies. His <hi rend="italic">Saints syriaques</hi>, which was left unfinished at his death,
               serves as another repertory; this covers only those saints who are specific to the
               Syriac Churches. He also contributed many articles to the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire d’histoire et de géographie ecclésiastiques</hi> and to the <hi rend="italic">Enciclopedia dei Santi: le Chiese orientali</hi> (1998–9). Fiey was
               one of the first scholars to use the term ‘syriaque’ as an ethnic term, as found in
               the title of his brief history, told for children (1996). The Festschrift that was
               being prepared for him eventually appeared as a memorial volume; this also contains
               Fiey’s own account of his life, ironically entitled ‘A quiet little life’.</p>

                    <p>Italian Syriac scholar, Professor of Semitic philology and Assyriology at the
               universities of Florence (1930–1940) and Rome (1940–56). Trained in law, philosophy,
               and Semitic languages at the university of Graz, in his youth he hand-copied a large
               number of unedited Syriac texts in the major European libraries, particularly in the
               British Museum. A versatile and extremely productive scholar, he was the founder of
               academic Assyriology in Italy, and to this discipline he devoted the best of his
               energies after 1927, but he never ceased publishing and studying the Syriac materials
               that he had collected before the First World War. His main areas of expertise,
               cultivated in over 80 articles and book reviews since 1914, included: the Syriac
               tradition of Aristotelian logic (particularly the translation and commentary to the
               Organon by <ref rend="bold">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref> [1922–43]); the Greek
               background of philosophical and theological writings by authors such as <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes, <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (to whose psychology he devoted a series of essays [1931–3]);
               the edition of several Syriac astrological and divinatory texts. The most important
               results of his research on Syriac philosophy are summarized in his essays ‘Meine
               Arbeiten über die Philosophie bei den Syrern’, <hi rend="italic">Archiv für
                  Geschichte der Philosophie</hi> 37 (1925), 2–15, and ‘I miei lavori dal 1928 al

                  d’Istruzione Classica</hi> 19 (1941), 121–149. His last essay on a Syriac topic
               concerned the famous illuminated ms. of the <ref rend="bold">Rabbula Gospels</ref> in
               the Medicean-Laurentian Library in Florence (1959). During the last phase of his
               scholarly activity (1948–57), he also devoted several studies to selected topics of
               Mandaean religion and literature, as well as to Mandaic lexicography.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>The Monastery of Qarṭmin began long before its official foundation date of 397. The
               founders were Shmuel (Samuel) of Eshtin and his disciple Shemʿun (Simeon) of Qarṭmin.
               In the village of Qarṭmin (Yayvantepe) there is a church of the martyred bp. Karpos,
               Shmuel’s spiritual father. Karpos was killed, according to the Life of Shmuel, by
               Persian raiders on the southern escarpment of <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, which
               rises from the Plain of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>. The most likely context is 350,
               when Nisibis, then a Roman city, was besieged. Shmuel fled north from the raiders,
               into the hills, and so came to the village of Qarṭmin, where he acquired a disciple,
               Shemʿun. Together they lived in a ruined temple now called ‘The Arches of Mor
               Gabriel’. Then the boy Shemʿun had a dream in which he was commanded by an angel to
               build a Beth Ṣlutho (open-air enclosure for prayer) further to the west. Perhaps
               Shemʿun was still alive when, more than forty years later, the Roman Emperor
               established the institution officially by his benefaction in 397.</p>
                    <p>The answer to the question of how the Emperor in Constantinople came to hear of this
               remote monastery and to consider it worthy of his attention must be connected with
               the Roman frontier-garrison in the Castle of Tur ʿAbdin built after the Persian raid
               of 350. The Christian soldiers in the castle honoured the holy men of Qarṭmin and
               attributed the security of the frontier partly to their prayers. It may well be that
               the Emperor also believed in the efficacy of the holy men’s prayers and that the
               first large benefactions to Qarṭmin (gold to build buildings, valuable communion
               vessels, and vestments for the liturgy) were intended not only to raise morale, but
               also to propitiate the God of Victories. The gesture of Honorius and Arcadius was
               repeated even more generously by the following administration, that of Theodosius
               II.</p>
                    <p>Theodosius’s death nearly coincided with the Council of Chalcedon (451), for which
               the new Emperor, Marcian, was personally responsible. Considering the later
               reputation of Qarṭmin as a focus of opposition to Chalcedon, it seems likely that, by
               disagreeing with that council, the monks forfeited a benefaction from this emperor.
               For the rest of the century confusion reigned. Some emperors, like Zeno and
               Anastasius, tried to compromise on the apparently insoluble issue of Chalcedon. But
               in 512, Anastasius, changing his policy, sided with the opponents of the Council. In
               the same year, according to the record preserved at Qarṭmin, he caused a church with
               a splendid prayer hall to be built there. This is still in use as the main church of
               the monastery. It seems likely that he also built the so-called ‘Dome of Theodora’,
               an octagon of identical height and building materials, and that this was originally
               used as a baptistery. Later, when there were no longer large numbers of adult
               converts to Christianity who came to the monastery to be baptized after making a
               penitential pilgrimage, the dome was used as a kitchen. The great slab in the main
               church was made in the 8th cent. for the purpose of making bread dough; for many
               centuries it stood under the dome.</p>
                    <p>After Anastasius, no emperor declared himself an opponent of Chalcedon, and no
               emperor made a benefaction to Qarṭmin. There is a story that the Empress <ref rend="bold">Theodora</ref>, consort of Justinian I, who was undoubtedly a great
               friend of monks and especially of those opposed to the Council of Chalcedon, visited
               Qarṭmin and gave it the dome which is named after her. This report is unworthy of
               credence.</p>
                    <p>The monastery became the residence of a bp. when the Persian Conquest created
               vacancies on four sees in the area; the abbot of Qarṭmin was asked to fill them all
               until suitable men could be found for those outside Ṭur ʿAbdin. By the time of the
               Arab Conquest, in 639/40, the abbot of Qarṭmin, now Gabriel of Beth Qustan
               (Bequsyone), was managing two dioceses from his monastery: that of Ṭur ʿAbdin and
               that of Dara. No doubt the success with which he negotiated a treaty with the Arab
               conquerors, protecting the rights of the Christians in his region, made him great in
               the eyes of later generations. When his Life came to be written, little was
               remembered about him, which shows that it took time for him to acquire the reputation
               of a saint. He had certainly acquired it by the year 774, in which the plague raged
               in Ṭur ʿAbdin, killing 94 monks at Qarṭmin and all the prominent people at <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Ṣalīb</ref>. After 30 Qarṭmin monks had died in a single night,
               the corpse of Gabriel was exhumed and fixed upright in the church to pray for an end
               to the plague. After this, the right arm was detached and taken to Ḥaḥ, near Dayr
               al-Ṣalīb, to bring an end to the plague there also.</p>
                    <p>The loss of 94 monks did not bring to an end the prosperity of Qarṭmin, which was now
               sometimes called Dayro d-ʿUmro (Arabic <hi rend="italic">Dayr al-ʿUmr</hi>), though
               it did perhaps make people begin to call it ‘The Monastery of Gabriel’. The miracle
               performed by Mor Gabriel may also have created a need for a written history of the
               monastery including the Lives of Shmuel and Shemʿun and a Life of Gabriel (‘The
               Qarṭmin Trilogy’).</p>
                    <p>Mor Shemʿun d-Zayte, ‘Simeon of the Olive-Trees’ (d. 734), a monk of Qarṭmin, became
               bp. of <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref> and used his influence to build in and around
               Nisibis, whose Christian community (existing alongside Zoroastrians) was largely Ch.
               of E., profit-making installations, such as olive-presses, water-mills, bath-houses,
               and inns, which would add to the income of the Monastery of Qarṭmin. Qarṭmin remained
               buoyant into the late 8th cent.; but after about 800 a decline set in. The 9th cent.
               seems to have been a period of low ebb. ‘Mor Gabriel’s Monastery’ settled down into a
               cosy relationship with the neighbouring villages, particularly Beth Sbirino (Bsorino)
               to the east. It was a man from that village, bp. Yuḥanon, who revived, in the 11th
               cent. (after it had been extinct for a cent.), the ancient Edessene script for use in
               making new parchment copies of the Gospels. He called it <hi rend="italic">sreṭ
                  ewangeliyon</hi> ‘Gospel script’ (one of the possible etymologies of the name
               esṭrangelo). One ms. written out and illustrated by his nephews, Emmanuel and Niho,
               monks of Qarṭmin, is extant in Berlin. <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> speaks of a
               total of seventy such volumes by these calligraphists in the library of Qarṭmin. This
               ‘renaissance’ was ultimately the consequence of the Byzantine reconquest of <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref> in 934.</p>
                    <p>The Monastery of Mor Gabriel is today the residence of the bp. of Ṭur ʿAbdin and
               gives the appearance of great prosperity, though the villages all around are becoming
               depopulated.</p>

               produced a number of famous physicians first in Gondeshapur (<ref rend="bold">Beth

               Richter-Bernburg, in <hi rend="italic">EIr</hi>, vol.4 [1990], 333–6). Gabriel
               himself was the personal physician of Caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd and later also of
               al-Amīn and al-Maʾmūn. He is said to have composed (in Arabic) a number of works in
               the field of medicine, little of which survives (a list is provided in F. Sezgin, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums</hi>[1967–2007], vol. 3,
               226–7). For his research, Gabriel commissioned Arabic translations of Greek authors,
               especially <ref rend="bold">Galen</ref>, from <ref rend="bold">Iyob of Edessa</ref> (d.
               ca. 835?) and <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873) (see G. Bergsträsser, <hi rend="italic">Ḥunain Ibn Isḥāq. Über die syrischen und arabischen

                    <p>Gabriel appears several times in the letters of Cath. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos
                  I</ref> (d. 823). Letter 47, for instance, mentions Gabriel’s involvement with
               Timotheos in procuring copies of the <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref> (ed. O. Braun,
               ‘Ein Brief des Katholikos Timotheos I über biblische Studien des 9. Jahrhunderts’,
                  <hi rend="italic">OC</hi> 1 [1901], 299–313; ET in S. P. Brock, <hi rend="italic">A brief outline of Syriac literature</hi>[2nd ed. 2009], 240–5), while Letter 21
               refers to Gabriel’s intercession with the Caliph on behalf of Timotheos (O. Braun,
                  <hi rend="italic">Timothei patriarchae I epistolae</hi>[CSCO 74–5; 1914–15],
               133.12–5 [Syr.], 89.22–4 [LT]). Notwithstanding the seemingly amicable relationship
               between these two men, it is reported that Timotheos condemned Gabriel for his
               philandering, but that Gabriel eventually repented (see H. Gismondi, <hi rend="italic">Maris Amri et Slibae. De patriarchis nestorianorum commentaria</hi>
               [1896–99], vol. 1, 74 [<hi rend="italic">Maris textus arabicus</hi>], vol. 1, 65 [<hi rend="italic">Maris versio latina</hi>]).</p>
                    <p>Gabriel is cited a number of times in the Lexicon of <ref rend="bold">Ḥasan bar
                  Bahlul</ref> (see R. Duval, <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Syriacum auctore Hassano bar
                  Bahlule</hi> [3 vols.; 1888–1901, repr. 1970], xvi-xvii). He is also mentioned in
               the ‘Catalogue’ of <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, vol. 3, 257–8) where he is grouped together with Ḥasan bar
                  Bahlul, <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar ʿAli</ref>, and a certain ‘Maruzaya’ (probably
               either <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ of Merv</ref>or Zekarya of Merv, assuming that they are
               two distinct individuals). This passage is, however, ambiguous as to whether Gabriel
               was the author of a Lexicon (so Assemani and Baumstark) or was only one of the
               principal sources of the Lexicon of Bar Bahlul (so Duval).</p>

                    <p>Metropolitan of Baṣra; author of a collection of juridical texts. Next to nothing is
               known about Gabriel’s life, except that he was metropolitan in 884 and in 893. In the
               last quarter of the 9th cent., he compiled a collection of civil and ecclesiastical
               laws in two parts, for which he primarily drew on materials from existing law books
               of E.-Syr. authors: <ref rend="bold">Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿbokht</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar
                  Nun</ref>, <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</ref>, and from the so-called
               Syro-Roman Law Book, the 73 pseudo-Nicene canons attributed to <ref rend="bold">Marutha
                  of Maypherqaṭ</ref>, and the canons of the E.-Syr. synods (<ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>). Gabriel did not reproduce these sources literally,
               but abbreviated and reworked them. The first part of the collection deals with
               matrimonial law, hereditary law, and other secular matters; the second part contains
               ecclesiastical rules concerning church hierarchy, hospitals, poorhouses, schools, and
               monasteries. While the entire collection is structured in the form of questions and
               answers as a technical device allowing the incorporation of long quotations, it is
               only in the substantial section devoted to liturgical issues that real questions are
               asked and answers provided (Second part, B, 1–70). A particularly interesting and, as
               far as Syriac is concerned, unique text provides a blueprint for the regulations for
               an association of artisans (First part, 48). Only fragments of Gabriel’s collection
               have been preserved, but the work can largely be reconstructed with the help of the
               Syriac Nomocanon of <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (d. 1318) and of the
               second part of the Arabic collection <hi rend="italic">Fiqh al-Naṣrāniyya</hi> by
                  <ref rend="bold">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref> (1st half of 11th cent.), two works that are
               largely dependent on Gabriel’s collection.</p>

                    <p>Metropolitan bp. of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> and poet. Gabriel is famous for a long
                  <ref rend="bold">ʿonitha</ref>, which according to the title he wrote when he was a
               monk in the Monastery of Beth Qoqa. It has Sabrishoʿ (late 6th – early 7th cent.),
               the founder of this monastery, as its main subject, but the author speaks about him
               only after having given a long overview of salvation history. This begins with
               creation and extends to the birth of Christ and the life of apostles and saints
               (including several Egyptian saints). Partly in twelve- and partly in eight-syllable
               rhymed verses, the poem has a convoluted style and abounds in Greek words. While it
               has failed to charm modern scholars (Baumstark: ‘eine monströse ʿOnithā’; Fiey:
               ‘désespérément vague et très prolixe’), the number of mss. that preserve it is an
               indication of its popularity. A few other, much shorter poems are preserved as well.
               Assemani assumes Gabriel’s authorship for an introductory piece that precedes the
               ‘Revelation of Paul’ in ms. Vat. Syr. 180 (which also contains the long <hi rend="italic">ʿonitha</hi>) without, however, providing evidence. In his capacity
               as Metropolitan bp. of Mosul Gabriel took part in the election of Cath. <ref rend="bold">Yahbalaha III</ref> in 1281. No further details about his life (nor
               about his name, which means ‘locust’) are known. Gabriel’s work has remained

                    <p>Author of an important Commentary on the Liturgy. Several Gabriels from <ref rend="bold">Beth Qaṭraye</ref> are known from the 6th/7th cent., but this Gabriel
               (described as bar Lipeh) is probably not to be equated with any of the others.
               A  date of writing prior to the liturgical reforms of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb
                  III</ref> is certain, since he mentions that <ref rend="bold">Shubḥalmaran</ref>,
               metropolitan of <ref rend="bold">Karka d-Beth Slokh</ref> was still alive. The
               Commentary is divided into 5 <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, each with a series of
               questions and answers. These cover: 1. <hi rend="italic">ramšā</hi> on weekdays (15
               questions); 2. <hi rend="italic">ṣaprā</hi> on weekdays (17 questions); 3. <hi rend="italic">ramšā</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lelyā</hi> on Sundays (5
               questions); 4. <hi rend="italic">ṣaprā</hi> on Sundays (9 questions); 5. Eucharistic
               Mysteries (8 questions, the second of which is a commentary on the Eucharistic rite).
               This important work is preserved in a single ms. (Brit. Libr. Or. 3336) of the 13th
               cent. (though the ms. has a date, its reading is uncertain); so far only the
               commentary on the Eucharist has been published and translated. An abbreviated form of
               at least much of the work is attributed to <ref rend="bold">Abraham bar Lipeh</ref>
               (ed. R. H.  Connolly, in CSCO 71, 76; 1911, 1915). The relationship between Gabriel
               and Abraham is not clear.</p>

                    <p>Influential Greek writer on <ref rend="bold">medicine</ref>from Pergamum. A short
               biographical note concerning him is given by <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>(<hi rend="italic">Chronicon Syriacum</hi>, ed. Bedjan, 53–4). His medical writings,
               together with his doctrine of the four humors, proved to be extremely influential and
               came to dominate medical thinking in both East and West for well over a thousand
               years. Numerous works of his were translated into Syriac, and an invaluable listing
               of these and their translators is preserved in <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref>’s
                  <hi rend="italic">Risāla</hi>, concerning his own translations of works by Galen.
                  <ref rend="bold">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref> is the earliest of the translators who
               are mentioned. Only a few of the many Syriac translations survive (including some of
               those by Sergios); these are either in early mss., or incorporated into a large
               compendium (ed. Budge; the identification of passages by Galen was subsequently made
               by Schleifer).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">Gannat Bussāme</hi> ‘Garden of Delights’ is an extensive
               commentary on the E.-Syr. lectionary. Tradition ascribes the work to an otherwise
               unknown ‘Interpreter of the Turks’. The date and place of the composition are
               uncertain. Although some modern scholars hold to the 13th cent. as the date of its
               composition, there may be some arguments for the assumption that the <hi rend="italic">Gannat Bussāme</hi> was composed in the 10th cent. in the city of
                  <ref rend="bold">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>(Gondeshapur). The text tradition shows two lines
               of transmission: one going back to a lost ‘Vorlage’ of the old ms. (olim) Urmi 180,
               the other to a lost ms. from the monastery of Abraham (the Upper Monastery in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>). The latter represents a revision of the lectionary
               allowing the work’s adaptation to the practice of the Upper Monastery in Mosul. The
               original lectionary of the <hi rend="italic">Gannat Bussāme</hi>, however, shows
               correspondences both with the monastic usage and with the practice in the Cathedral
               Church of Kokhe in <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, but it also has lessons
               found in neither. It is, therefore, likely that the <hi rend="italic">Gannat
                  Bussāme</hi> was originally based on a lectionary system that reflected a specific
               local usage. The <hi rend="italic">Gannat Bussāme</hi> is a very important source
               for the E.-Syr. exegetical tradition, since its commentary, apart from its use of the
               commentaries of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, is based on sources and the
               works of authors that are lost or inaccessible today. In particular two authors
               should be mentioned here. Firstly, the exegetical prose homilies written by <ref rend="bold">Aba II of Kashkar</ref> (7th–8th cent.), of which many fragments and
               extracts have been preserved in the <hi rend="italic">Gannat Bussāme</hi>, containing
               the exegesis of passages from Gen., Num., Isa., and the four Gospels. Secondly, the
               commentaries of Ṣliba Zkha <ref rend="bold">Ṣharbokht bar Msargis</ref>, an author who
               is not known in the Syriac tradition outside of the <hi rend="italic">Gannat
                  Bussāme</hi>. It is, however, very likely that we may identify Ṣharbokht with
               Ṣahārbukht b. Māsarjīs, known from the Arabic-Islamic tradition as a medical author
               from Beth Lapaṭ, who lived in the 9th cent. The excerpts from Ṣharbokht in the <hi rend="italic">Gannat Bussāme</hi> concern the exegesis of pericopes from the four
               Gospels, Acts, and Rom. It appears from these excerpts that Ṣharbokht’s commentaries
               are typical representatives of exegetical compilation works (comparable, for example,
               with the genre of Ishoʿdad of Merv’s commentaries on the OT and NT). Unique is the
               way in which Ṣharbokht incorporates theoretical medical knowledge in his exegesis. It
               is possible that he as a teacher was connected with both the Theological School and
               the Medical School in Beth Lapaṭ.</p>

               2.22) and therefore to the legend of Moses as the inventor of writing, or to a
               certain Carsciun. In Levantine Arabic, <hi rend="italic">btaḥkī karšūnī</hi>? ‘do you
               speak Garshuni?’ indicates an exotic, incomprehensible language. The variant Karshuni
               probably derives from the rendering of a Syriac /g/ in Arabic script. The use of the
               term has been extended to label other cases of heterography: Armenian, Kurdish,
               Malayalam, Persian, or Turkish ‘Garshuni’ (E.-Syr. script).</p>
                    <p>Most Garshuni texts are written in Serṭo. Especially Maron. scribes, belonging to a
               profoundly arabized community, wrote various kinds of Garshuni texts, on various
               mediums. The earliest dated sample known so far is a historical note written in 1154
               in the margins of the <ref rend="bold">Rabbula Gospels</ref>, f. 7b. The earliest
               complete literary texts copied in Garshuni are of the 14th cent. The system was used
               by E. Syrians too, from the 17th cent. Recording the Arabic language in Syriac script
               answers ideological rather than practical purposes. The emergence of Garshuni may be
               explained by the symbolic significance of the traditional alphabet as a device to
               assert and strengthen cultural identity and the magic and aesthetic virtues
               attributed to it.</p>
                    <p>Garshuni requires a high degree of literacy in Arabic. Classical Arabic diacritics
               and spelling conventions are commonly used. The correspondence between Syriac
               graphemes and Arabic phonemes is not always one-to-one, e.g., the Syriac letter <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is used for both Arabic <hi rend="italic">gh</hi>and <hi rend="italic">j</hi>.</p>

                    </note>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>The modern state of Georgia covers two distinct regions in antiquity, Lazika to the
               west, and Iberia (Kartli) to the east, with its capital at Mtskheta. Archaeological
               evidence indicates that there were Christians living in Mtskheta by the 3rd cent.,
               but not until the first half of the 4th cent. did Christianity have a significant
               presence in Iberia. According to tradition the Christianization of Iberia was due to
               the influence of St. Nino, a captive slave woman who converted King Mirian III in the
               330s (related, but without any names, also in <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>,
               Chronicle VII.3). By the 5th cent. Christianity was the dominant faith in Iberia. The
               most primitive Georgian literary strata display the influence of Syriac roots,
               mediated largely through <ref rend="bold">Armenian</ref> channels. Prior to the 7th
               cent. the Georgian Church was miaphysite. The geographical proximity and doctrinal
               affinities with miaphysite Syriac and Armenian communities ensured that those
               Churches would have a great impact on early Georgian literature, theology, religious
               practices, and ecclesiastical politics. In the early 7th cent. the Georgian Church
               broke with the Armenian Church and became Chalcedonian, thereby aligning itself with
               Byzantium. From that time Greek influence became more prominent in Georgian literary
               culture and religious practices. The spread of monasticism in Georgia is largely
               traced back to the arrival in the 6th<hi rend="superscript"/>cent. of the ‘Thirteen
               Syrian Fathers’, one of whom, Iovane (John), is said to have been from ‘the the
               borders of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> in the land of Mesopotamia’. None of them can
               be identified with otherwise known figures, though one (Abibos) does have a Syriac
               name, but with a Greek ending; it seems likely that they were miaphysite. The
               biographies connected with these Syrian saints underwent development over the course
               of time (Martin-Hisard), and now an older recension has recently turned up among the
               ‘New Finds’ of Georgian mss. at <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref>,
               Sinai (Aleksidze).</p>
                    <p>There are a number of disparate connections between Syriac and Georgian Christianity,
               some direct, others indirect.</p>
                    <p>1. The indirect influence (via Armenian) of early Syriac versions and/or the <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref> on some early mss. of the Georgian Gospels and Acts
               has been claimed by some scholars, but this is a topic where great caution needs to
               be exercised before firm conclusions can be drawn, especially regarding the proposed
               influence of the Diatessaron (Birdsall).</p>
                    <p>2. The prince <ref rend="bold">Peter the Iberian</ref>, who had been a political
               hostage in Constantinople, eventually became a prominent miaphysite monk in Palestine
               in the late 5th cent. and was known to <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref>. Of the two Greek
               biographies of him, one (perhaps by <ref rend="bold">John Rufus</ref>) survives in
               Syriac translation, while the other, by <ref rend="bold">Zacharias Rhetor</ref>, is
               lost apart from a minute Syriac fragment. The relationship of these to the Georgian
               Life, where Peter has become Chalcedonian, is not entirely clear. The theory that
               Peter is the author behind the writings of <ref rend="bold">Pseodo-Dionysius the
                  Areopagite</ref> has only found limited acceptance.</p>
                    <p>3. Georgian and Syriac speakers came into contact with one another in several
               different localities:</p>
                    <p>A. From the 10th–13th cent. the Black Mountain, to the northwest of Antioch, was home
               to monasteries of many different Churches, including both Syriac (Melkite) and
               Georgian; a number of extant 11th-cent. mss. were written there (see Djobadze, 108–11
               for Georgian, and Brock 1990 for Syriac). Although it was there that several Georgian
               translations of Syriac writers were made, these were not direct from Syriac, but by
               way of Greek.</p>
                    <p>B. <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> and the monasteries of the Judaean desert. The
               Georgian presence in Jerusalem goes back to the 5th cent., and early Georgian
               liturgical mss., along with some Armenian and <ref rend="bold">Christian Palestinian
                  Aramaic</ref> mss., constitute an important witness to the early form of the
               Jerusalem liturgy. In the Middle Ages the Monastery of the Holy Cross (now Greek) was
               in Georgian hands. The presence of both Syriac and Georgian monks at various
               monasteries, notably Mar Saba, is attested especially for the 9th–10th cent.</p>
                    <p>C. Sinai. From at least the 9th–13th cent. Syriac- and Georgian-speaking monks must
               have lived side by side on Sinai, and many mss. in these languages were copied there
               (table of early dated mss. in Brock 2003, 112–3; this can now be supplemented from
               the ‘New Finds’). Especially in the late 10th cent. there were close connections
               between Mar Saba Monastery and St. Catherine’s Monastery. The Georgian monk Iovane
               Zosime (active between 949 and 987; Tarchnishvili, 109–14) moved from Mar Saba to St.
               Catherine’s some time before 973. For some of his manuscripts this famous scribe
               re-used older Christian Palestinian Aramaic manuscripts; one of these is the ‘Codex
               Zosimi Rescriptus’ of 979, now in the Schøyen Collection (formerly Sinai, Georgian
               ms. 81); the undertext, containing a variety of different works, has been
               reconstructed in Desreumaux 1997. Other mss. copied by Iovane with Christian
               Palestinian Aramaic undertexts are Sinai New Finds, Georgian mss. 19 (dated 980) and
               20 (dated 986), the latter being part of ms. 93+92 of the Old Collection (now divided
               between Princeton, Birmingham, and Göttingen). It was probably in the 10th cent. that
               some quire numbers in Georgian were added to Sinai Syr. 30 (see <ref rend="bold">Old
                  Syriac Version</ref>).</p>
                    <p>4. Georgian translations of Syriac authors may be either made from Syriac, or through
               the intermediary of Greek, Armenian, or Arabic. Translations by way of Armenian or
               directly from Syriac will be the earliest; amongst those that have been published
               are: <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, ‘Discourse’ 6 (under the name of <ref rend="bold">Hippolytus</ref>; ed. with LT, G. Garitte, in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>77 [1964],
               301–66), the <ref rend="bold">Life of Ephrem</ref> and the Life of <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref> (ed. with LT G. Garitte, in CSCO 171–2, 1957); the <ref rend="bold">Cave of Treasures</ref> (ed. with FT, J.-P. Mahé, in CSCO 526–7,
               1992–3), and <ref rend="bold">Sahdona</ref>, ‘Book of Perfection’, II, 7–12 (ed. with
               LT, G. Garitte, in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>69 [1956], 243–312). The homily on the
               Nativity attributed to <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> which features in a late
               10th-cent. early Homiliary (Van Esbroeck, 193–94) appears not to correspond with any
               of his published works. Translations were made by way of Greek of a number of works
               attributed to <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> (few if any are genuine Ephrem apart from
               the ‘Repentance of Nineveh’, ed. with LT, Garitte, in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>80
               [1967], 75–119) and of Discourses from the First Part of the works by <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>. These were the work of the prolific translator Euthymius
               of the Holy Mountain (d. 1028; Tarchnishvili, 126–54), according to his Life (ET by
               T. Grdzelidze, <hi rend="italic">Georgian Monks on Mount Athos</hi>[2009], 69–70),
               though a few texts under Ephrem’s name already feature in a Homiliary dated 925
               (Garitte, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue,</hi> no. 36). Further works from the Greek
               Ephrem corpus were translated by another famous translator, Epʿrem Mtsire (‘the
               Less’), working on the Black Mountain in the late 11th cent. (Tarchnishvili, 182–98,
               esp.189). A few hagiographical texts are said to have been translated directly from
               Syriac, such as that on the martyrs Aqebshma, Yausep, and Aitalaha (Tarchnishvili,
               467); the Life of Porphyry of Gaza came into Georgian by way of a lost Syriac
               translation from the Greek (Childers). In the case of others, such as the Life of
               Abraham and his niece Mary, the precise source, Greek, Syriac, or Arabic, remains to
               be determined. It is noticeable that most of the Syriac saints commemorated in the
               10th-cent. Calendar of Palestinian provenance (ed. Garitte, <hi rend="italic">Le
                  calendrier palestino-géorgien</hi>, 1958) are martyrs of the Persian Empire.</p>
                    <p>5. Some more general influences in the form of theological phraseology (Winkler) and
               of historical ideology (Rapp, 125–9) have also been discerned.</p>

                    <p>Metropolitan bp. of <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref> and Cath. (from 660 or 658 until
               his death). Gewargis hailed from <ref rend="bold">Beth Garmai</ref>and was a monk in
                  <ref rend="bold">Beth ʿAbe</ref>. He came into contact with the future Cath. <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III</ref>, whose successor he became first as bp. of Adiabene
               and later as cath. In 676 Gewargis convened an important synod on the island of
               Dirin, in <ref rend="bold">Beth Qaṭraye</ref>, the region that, under his predecessor,
               had seen major troubles and division (which perhaps still resonated in the background
               of this synod). The report and canons of the synod are preserved in the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. The canons deal with: the significance of
               preaching, in particular on feast days (no. 1); church discipline, the proper place
               of monks, and a better division between the tasks of clergy and laity (nos. 2–8, with
               no. 6 focusing on the role of the church in jurisdiction); strict rules for the <hi rend="italic">bnāt qyāmā</hi> (no. 9), clergy and bps. (nos. 10–11), monks (no.
               12), liturgy (no. 15), and funerals (no. 18); abuses and lax behavior with regard to
               marriage (nos. 13, 14, and 16; with warnings against unions between Christian women
               and ‘pagans’ [<hi rend="italic">ḥanpe</hi>], a term which may perhaps include
               Muslims, as well as against polygamy); a ban on drinking wine with Jews in Jewish
               taverns, especially after the Christian liturgy (no. 17); and the respect due to bps.
               (no. 19).</p>
                    <p>Attached to the canons is a letter (dated a few years later), written by Cath.
               Gewargis to a certain Mina, priest and chorbishop in Persia, which sets out the
               theology and Christology of the Ch. of E. The author defends the authority of <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Theodore</ref> (of Mopsuestia)
               against those who challenge it, and includes a short patristic florilegium (featuring
               passages attributed to <ref rend="bold">Ignatius of Antioch</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Athanasius</ref>, Ambrose, <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>,
               Amphilochius of Iconium, <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref>, and even <ref rend="bold">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, who occasionally was ‘compelled’ to write the
               truth), showing that the Ch. of E. preserved orthodox Christianity as it developed in
               the Roman Empire, unsullied by heretical teachings.</p>
                    <p>Cath. Gewargis is also said to have commissioned <ref rend="bold">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref>, a
               fellow monk from the Monastery of Beth ʿAbe, to compile the ‘Paradise of the
               Fathers’, which became an authoritative collection of ascetic texts.</p>

                    <p>Unknown author of an important Commentary on the Liturgical rites. An extensive
               liturgical commentary in seven sections is preserved in a number of mss.; in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Orientalis</hi> Assemani attributed the work to <ref rend="bold">Gewargis of Arbela</ref> (9th cent.?), but without any good evidence; as
               a result the author is normally now referred to as ‘Pseudo-Gewargis of Arbela’
               (another wrong attribution is to <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</ref>). The
               chapters in each section provide answers to particular questions. The seven sections
               cover the following topics: 1. the liturgical year (24 questions); 2. <hi rend="italic">ramšā</hi> (21 questions); 3. <hi rend="italic">lelyā</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ṣaprā</hi> (9 questions); 4. the Eucharistic Mysteries
               (30 questions); 5. Baptism (9 questions); 6. Consecration of a church (8  questions);
               and 7. Burial, and Marriage (7 questions; the section on Marriage seems to be a
               secondary addition, though perhaps by the same author). Connolly’s edition also
               includes the short ‘Commentary on the (liturgical) Services’ by <ref rend="bold">Abraham bar Lipeh</ref> of <ref rend="bold">Beth Qaṭraye</ref> (II, 161–80); in
               many places this is simply an abbreviation of <ref rend="bold">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref>’s
               Commentary.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">Kthābhā d-wardā</hi>‘Book of the Rose’ is a collection of hymns
               for the various festivals of the liturgical year, usually attributed in the mss. to a
               certain Gewargis, surnamed Warda. Most of the hymns belong to the <ref rend="bold">ʿOnithā</ref>genre and parts or the whole of the corpus have been incorporated,
               especially in the 19th cent., in larger collections of <hi rend="italic">ʿonyāthā</hi> by other hymnographers. So far, only 31 of the ca. 150 items have
               been published or translated. The ms. transmission presents a high degree of
               variation in the number and order of the texts. No systematic study of the text
               history of the <hi rend="italic">Kthābhā d-wardā</hi> or of the hymns attributed to
               Gewargis is available, and it is therefore difficult to define criteria of
               authenticity. The two poems ‘On the capture of Jerusalem by Saladin’, preserved in
               only one ms., probably do not belong to the original nucleus.</p>
                    <p>There is no reliable information on the life or birthplace of the alleged author
               (and/or compiler?). One poem is an outcry against an infidel deacon of a village near
                  <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref>, and in one ms. (Sachau 64) it is said that Gewargis
               was from Arbela, perhaps because he has been confused with the 10th-cent. E-Syr.
               author <ref rend="bold">Gewargis of Arbela</ref>, or in order to distinguish him from a
               Gewargis of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, mentioned in the same ms. Like <ref rend="bold">Khamis bar Qardaḥe</ref> (also connected with Arbela), Gewargis is not included
               in the ‘Paradise of Eden’ by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>. Attempts to
               place Gewargis in the first half of the 13th cent. at the time of the events
               described in poems of the <hi rend="italic">Wardā</hi> collection (famines and the
               Mongol raids of 1223/4–1235/6) are in contradiction with, e.g. the mention of
               Timotheos II (Patr. from 1318 to 1332) in the ‘ʿOnithā on the Catholicoi of the
               East’.</p>
                    <p>The <hi rend="italic">Wardā</hi> contains exhortations to repentance, hymns for the
               various feasts, commemorations of saints, martyrs, and calamitous historical events.
               The melody and the liturgical occasion for which the text is fitted are noted above
               each poem. The use of biblical texts and exempla is often rich and felicitous. Some
               texts elaborate on apocryphal material, e.g. ‘In praise of Mary’ lists the
               traditional names of the twelve kings (as in <ref rend="bold">Shlemon of Baṣra</ref>)
               and ‘On the Childhood of Christ’ possibly derives from a lost E.-Syr. source, parts
               of which are preserved in the ‘History of the Blessed Virgin Mary’ (ed.
               E. A. W.  Budge, 1899). A ‘<hi rend="italic">memrā</hi>on Man as Microcosm’ appears
               to derive from Greek medical and philosophical traditions via the Syr. <hi rend="italic">Traité d’Ahoudemmeh sur l’homme</hi> (ed. F. Nau, PO 3.1, 1905). The
               hymns on historical events have recently been read as examples of theological
               reflection on history. More properly, they should be interpreted as liturgical texts,
               as their function was stated to be. Referring to specific historical events or, more
               in general, to disasters which were dramatically recurrent, they probably functioned
               as textual supports for public commemorations, as prayers of supplication, or to
               avert disaster.</p>

                    <p>Bp. and learned author. Shortly before his death Patr. <ref rend="bold">Athanasios II
               </ref>asked bp. Sargis Zakunoyo to ordain Giwargi bishop of the Arab tribes, which he
               did in Nov. 686. As a protegé of Athanasios II and a friend of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub
                  of Edessa</ref>, he belonged to a line of learned scholars associated with the
                  <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref>. On Yaʿqub’s death in 708 Giwargi
               completed the final book 7 of his commentary on the Six Days of Creation. Several of
               his works concern Greek philosophy, and he revised earlier translations of <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>’s ‘Categories’, ‘On Interpetation’, and ‘Prior
               Analytics’ (ed. G. Furlani); this is preserved in the 8th/9th-cent. ms. Brit. Libr.
               Add. 14,659, together with introductions and glosses. A number of verse texts are
               attributed to him: on the Patr. <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref>, the monastic life, the
               Myron (sometimes attributed to <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serug</ref>), Palm Sunday,
               the Forty Martyrs, and the Burial of Bishops (the last two remain unpublished). His
               11 letters cover a wide range of topics, including philosophy, astronomy, theology,
               and literary criticism; he also wrote a short commentary on baptism and
               eucharist.</p>

                    <p>Patr. (1687–1708) whose patriarchate was contested by five anti-patriarchs during
               various parts of his life. Born in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> to ʿAbd al-Karīm, his
               family produced three patr. (him, his nephew <ref rend="bold">Isḥoq</ref> [1709–24],
               and Giwargis IV [1768–81], an uncle’s grandson), two maph. (Matay II [1713–27], a
               nephew, and Loʿozor IV [1730–59], a nephew’s son), one bp. (a nephew’s son), and five
               priests (an uncle, a cousin, a brother, and two nephews).</p>
                    <p>Giwargis joined <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>, was ordained priest in 1669,
               and consecrated bp. for Jazīrat Qardu in 1677. When Maph. Yaldo voluntarily abdicated
               the maphrianate to serve in Malankara, Giwargis was installed maph. in his place in
               1684. On 22 Apr. 1687, he was elevated to the patriarchate.</p>
                    <p>Following disputes with the newly established Syr. Cath. community in <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>, Giwargis spent one year in the Aleppo courts and regained control
               over churches which were under the control of the Cath. party. He rebuilt <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> in 1699, and renewed many churches in <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> (1704), <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref> (1690s), Jazīrat Qardu, and Mosul. He built two new churches in Ḥisn
               Manṣūr (ca. 1701) and Zakho. Giwargis visited Edessa in ca. 1702 or 1703 where he was
               sent to prison due to conflicts with the Cath. party there. He died in 1708 and was
               buried in Dayr al-Zaʿfarān.</p>
                    <p>Many divisions took place during his lifetime. In 1701, there existed six patriarchs
               (Giwargis in Mardin, Ḥabib in <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, Peṭros who later
               converted to Catholicism, Denḥa, Behnam, and Shemʿun of Maʿdan), and three maphrians
               (Isḥoq Loʿozor, Isḥoq b. Gbir who later converted to Catholicism, and Loʿozor of Ṭur
               ʿAbdin).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Syr. Orth. Patr. (758–89). Giwargis was born in Bʿeltan, near <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref> (Emesa), perhaps in a Melk. family (according to a non-Syriac source
               [see Evetts, 413]), but apparently at a young age he turned Syr. Orth. He was
               educated in Syriac and Greek learning in the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of
                  Qenneshre</ref>.</p>
                    <p>After the death of Patr. Athanasios IV Sandaloyo, at the electoral synod at Mabbug in
               December 758, though still only a deacon, he was chosen Patr. Mesopotamian bishops
               opposed his elevation and somewhat later chose Yuḥanon of the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Qarqaphto</ref>, bp. of Kallinikos/Raqqaʿ, as an anti-patriarch. The
               schism could have ended in 762, when Yuḥanon of Kallinikos died, but at the synod at
               Serugh in 764/5 the Mesopotamian bishops accepted Dawid bp. of Dara as the successor
               to the deceased anti-patriarch.</p>
                    <p>Dawid accused Giwargis of tax irregularities, and Caliph Abū Jaʿfar ʿAbdullāh
               al-Manṣūr (754–75) put him in prison for nine years (767–75). After this Caliph’s
               death his son and successor, al-Mahdī, upon his accession in 775 released Giwargis,
               on the condition that he was not to exercise his office or title. Eventually, in 777,
               he was confirmed in his office by the Muslim authorities.</p>
                    <p>On 22 May 785 he presided over the synod in Kfar-Nabu in the region of Serugh at
               which 22 canons, mostly of a disciplinary nature, were passed.</p>
                    <p>During one of his pastoral journeys, in the region of Qlaudia, he fell sick and not
               long thereafter he died in the year 789/790 in <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor
                  Barṣawmo</ref> near <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref>, where he was also buried.</p>
                    <p>During his imprisonment he is reported to have written numerous discourses and
               metrical homilies (<hi rend="italic">memre</hi>), not preserved, as well as an
               exegetical work, the ‘Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew’, which displays his
               knowledge of <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref>, the Cappadocian fathers, and <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> (ms. Vat. Syr. 154, not published). He wrote
               also synodal letters and a letter to a deacon Guria of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>
               (quoted by <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, Chronicle, vol. 3, 5–8) on the formula
               ‘We break the heavenly bread’, the use of which later became the subject of a long
               controversy.</p>

                    <p>This short apocalyptic work, known only in Syriac, probably dates from the early 8th
               cent. (probably before ʿAbd al-Malik’s death in 705), and is not preserved quite
               complete. It misleadingly claims to have been translated from Hebrew into Greek and
               thence into Syriac. A narrative introduction outlines the life of Christ, from the
               Annunciation to the Ascension; after the Ascension the Apostles gather in the Upper
               Room and pray for a revelation ‘concerning the End’. Simon Peter, James, and John
               ‘the Little’, brother of James, then each describes the revelation he has received.
               Simon Peter’s revelation is anti-dyophysite in character, James’s is concerned with
               the destruction and rebuilding of <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>, while John’s is
               more strictly apocalyptic in character, describing the succession of kingdoms, a
               ‘king from the north’, the coming of a ‘wind from the south’ (i.e. Arab rule), and a
               succession of 12 kings; after a ‘week and a half’ the angel of wrath will descend,
               and ‘the Lord will return the south wind to its place’.</p>

               (1941–92). Born in Mayet (Sarthe), in the West of France on 1 Jan. 1905, he studied
               in Le Mans in a school of the Jesuit Fathers and entered the Society of Jesus. In
               1931, his uncle, Mgr. <ref rend="bold">René Graffin</ref>, the founder and first
               director of <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Orientalis</hi>, chose him to be his
               successor and secured the help of Pope Pius XI to obtain permission from the General
               of Jesuits that he should be allowed to prepare himself for this task. Graffin then
               studied all the Eastern Christian languages, but Syriac was to be his main field of
               interest. He taught Syriac at the Institut Catholique in Paris from 1951 to 1975 and
               was the professor of a whole generation of Syriac scholars, from France and abroad.
               In 1941, at the death of his uncle, he became director of the <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Orientalis,</hi>a task that he pursued for fifty years until 1992,
               when René Lavenant, at the Pontifical Oriental Institute in Rome, was entrusted with
               the directorship. Graffin himself was able to complete two major multi-volume
               editions initiated by M. Brière: <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref>’s ‘Cathedral
               Homilies’, to which, after Brière’s death (1960), Graffin contributed the edition and
               translation of homilies 1–57 (PO 35.3; 36.1, 3, and 4; 37.1; and 38.2; between 1969
               and 1977, all under the names of Brière and Graffin); and <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos
                  of Mabbog</ref>’s ‘Dissertationes decem de Uno e sancta Trinitate incorporato et
               passo’(also known as ‘Memre against Habbib’), to which he contributed the edition and
               translation of Memre 3–10 (PO 38.3; 39.4; 40.2; between 1977 and 1980, all under the
               names of Brière and Graffin) as well as an additional volume with accompanying texts
               and an important Florilegium (PO 41.1; 1982, under the names of Brière and Graffin).
               He published one of the ‘Bases’ of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s ‘Lamp of the
               Sanctuary’, dealing with theology (PO 27.4; 1957); a series of anonymous homilies of
               the 6th cent. (PO 41.4; 1984); and <ref rend="bold">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref>’s ‘Letter on
               the three degrees of monastic life’ (PO 45.2; 1992, co-authored with P. Harb). He
               also contributed regularly with editions, translations, and studies to <hi rend="italic">L’Orient syrien</hi>and later to <hi rend="italic">Parole de
                  l’Orient</hi>, as well as to several Festschrifts. He himself was the recipient of
               a Festschrift in 1978 and of an honorary doctorate from SEERI, in India, in 1997. He
               died in Paris on 4 Dec. 2002.</p>

                    <p>French Syriac scholar and founder of <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Syriaca</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Orientalis</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Revue de l’Orient
                  Chrétien</hi>. He studied Syriac in Rome with J. Bollig, and in Innsbruck with G.
               Bickell, after which he was appointed (1886) to teach Syriac at the Institut
               Catholique in Paris, in succession to J. P. P. Martin. When he became aware of the
               wealth of Syriac mss. in both Paris and London, he conceived the idea of founding the
               series <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Syriaca</hi> (I–III, 1894–1926), followed by <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Orientalis</hi> (1903– ). In 1909 he resigned his chair
               at the Institut Catholique to concentrate on his editorial work for the <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Orientalis</hi> and the periodical <hi rend="italic">Revue de l’Orient Chrétien</hi> (1896–1946). The practical aspects of this work
               also included the designing of Oriental typefaces and the invention of a special
               device for photographing mss. For many years he was assisted in editing the volumes
               of the <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Orientalis</hi> by <ref rend="bold">François

               149–80; this includes his formidable bibliography); unlike Nau, however, Graffin
               himself only published a small number of Syriac texts. After Graffin’s death the

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Over the course of some 500 years, from the late 4th to the late 9th cent. an
               enormous number of Greek texts were translated into Syriac. These translations fall
               into three main categories: biblical texts in Greek; patristic texts (by far the
               largest surviving category); secular texts (medicine, philosophy, uplifting
               literature). With the exception of an 8th-cent. translation of Homer’s ‘Iliad’
               (surviving only in some short excerpts), no Classical Greek poetry was ever
               translated, an indication that the motivation for undertaking translations was
               essentially utilitarian in character. Syriac scholars played a significant role in
               the ‘translation movement’ of the late 8th and 9th  centuries under Abbasid
               patronage, which provided the Arabic-speaking world with the Greek intellectual
               heritage of Late Antiquity; their contribution was especially important during the
               earlier years of this movement, seeing that there was a long tradition of translation
               from Greek into Syriac, but none yet from Greek into Arabic; for this reason many
               translators (including the most famous of them all, <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b.
                  Isḥāq</ref>) first translated from Greek into Syriac, and then from Syriac into
               Arabic.</p>
                    <p>In quite a number of cases, the Greek original of a work has been lost, and only the
               Syriac translation survives. This applies above all to patristic authors whose works
               were subsequently suppressed in the Greek Church, such as those of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref>. But even with prestigious Greek authors,
               Syriac may preserve a work lost in Greek; examples of this include <ref rend="bold">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref>’s ‘Theophania’ and <ref rend="bold">Cyril of
                  Alexandria</ref>’s ‘Homilies on Luke’. A number of secular writings whose Greek
               original is lost are preserved in Syriac translation, such as Themistius’s ‘On
               Virtue’ and Alexander of Aphrodisias’s ‘On the Universe (<hi rend="italic">kosmos</hi>)’. Even where the Greek original survives the Syriac translation may
               often be of considerable importance for editors of the Greek, since the Syriac
               translations were not only made at a date much earlier than that of the earliest
               Greek mss., but also they are not infrequently preserved in mss. that date from the
               6th and even 5th centuries. On the other hand, sometimes the earliest Syriac
               translations are so free that they are difficult to use for text-critical purposes,
               whereas it is the later translations, of the 6th and 7th centuries, which are the
               most useful, in view of their much more literal character.</p>
                    <p>During this half millennium of translation activity a marked shift in translation
               style can be observed, moving away from free and reader-oriented translations to
               literal and text-oriented ones; the culmination of this process occurred in the 7th
               cent., whereas during the ‘translation movement’ there was a return to a more
               reader-oriented approach. These changes in translation fashion led to many revisions
               being made of earlier translations.</p>
                    <p>1. Biblical: The earliest biblical translations from Greek were of <ref rend="bold">Tatian</ref>’s <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref> (unless this was originally
               written in Syriac) and the <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac Version</ref> (3rd cent.?). A
               revision of the Old Syriac, incorporating the rest of the Syriac canon of the New
               Testament, was made ca. 400, and this became the standard text of the Syriac
               Churches, eventually known as the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>. Subsequent
               revisions, confined to the Syr. Orth. tradition, were made in 508 (the lost
               ‘Philoxenian’, commissioned by <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>), and ca.
               615 (the <ref rend="bold">Ḥarqlean</ref>, made by <ref rend="bold">Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref>);
               this last provided a mirror rendering of the Greek original.</p>
                    <p>Translations from the Greek Old Testament are confined to the Syr. Orth. tradition.
               Philoxenos may also have commissioned a translation of certain books of the
               Septuagint (fragments survive), but much more important is the <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref>, made by <ref rend="bold">Pawlos of Tella</ref> ca. 615, from
               Origen’s revised Septuagint text. This covered the whole of the Septuagint, but does
               not survive complete. In the early 8th cent. <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>
               produced his own version of certain books, combining the Peshitta (made from Hebrew)
               with materials he had himself translated from Greek mss. of the Septuagint.</p>
                    <p>2. Patristic: The vast majority of surviving Syriac translations are of post-Nicene
               Greek Fathers, especially those of the 4th to 6th centuries. The Cappadocians, <ref rend="bold">Basil</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nyssa</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, are especially well represented, and even Gregory of
               Nazianzus’s poems got translated. In the Ch. of E. Theodore of Mopsuestia was
               regarded as the ‘Exegete’ par excellence, while among the Syr. Orth. it was Cyril of
               Alexandria and Severus who were held in particular honor. Since most 5th-cent.
               translations were free in character (and are sometimes paraphrases, rather than
               translations), a need was felt in the 6th and 7th cent. for either a revision of the
               earlier translation, or an entirely new one, keeping much closer to the Greek
               original. Thus the Homily collections of both Gregory of Nazianzus and Severus
               underwent thorough revisions in the 7th cent., the former undertaken by <ref rend="bold">Pawla of Edessa</ref> ca. 624, and the latter by Yaʿqub of Edessa
               towards the end of the century. The motivation for these revisions was sometimes the
               need for greater exactitude in the rendering of key theological terms, something
               which often resulted in the creation of neologisms in Syriac (an aspect commented
               upon by Yaʿqub of Edessa himself in his ‘Letter on Orthography’).</p>
                    <p>3. Secular: The earliest Syriac translations of Greek secular literature were in the
               area of popular philosophy with an ethical content, and were mostly made in the 5th
               cent. Surviving texts include works by Plutarch, Lucian, and Themistius. <ref rend="bold">Porphyry</ref>’s influential ‘Eisagoge’, or Introduction to <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>’s logical works, known as the Organon, or
               ‘(intellectual) Tool’, along with much of the Organon itself, and several of <ref rend="bold">Galen</ref>’s medical writings were first translated in the early 6th
               cent.; in this connection an important figure was the Archiatros <ref rend="bold">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref>, the translator of the Dionysian Corpus. By the end of
               the 6th cent. many of these translations had also become known to scholars of the Ch.
               of E. in the Persian Empire. The 7th cent. witnessed further translations in these
               fields, as well as revisions of 6th-cent. translations; these were mostly the work of
               Syr. Orth. scholars such as <ref rend="bold">Severos Sebokht</ref>, the Patriarch <ref rend="bold">Athanasios  II</ref>, Yaʿqub of Edessa, and (in the early 8th cent.)
                  <ref rend="bold">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The program of translating Greek philosophical, scientific, and medical literature,
               sponsored by the Abbasid Caliphs in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> in the late 8th and
               the 9th cent., involved scholars from all the Syr. Churches. Unfortunately, apart
               from that of Hippocrates’s Aphorisms, very little of these Syriac translations
               survives, though quotations from them can be found in subsequent Syriac encyclopedic
               literature (notably <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>) and in Arabic sources. Several
               of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>’s Letters include references to these
               translations. Although works by Aristotle feature prominently amongst those
               translated into Syriac, Plato’s writings are conspicuously absent.</p>
                    <p>In the course of the 9th–11th cent., when the Melkite Church replaced the Antiochian
               rite by the Constantinopolitan, a large number of liturgical (and a few
               hagiographical) texts were translated; amongst these, several poetic texts were
               subsequently taken over by the Syr. Orth.</p>

                    <p>Greek Church Father, and one of the three Cappadocian Fathers, whose influential
               writings earned him the title ‘the theologian’. He was appointed bp. of
               Constantinople during the Council there in 381, but he resigned shortly afterwards.
               Many of his writings were translated into Syriac, sometimes in two versions. The most
               important are:</p>
                    <p>1. 47 Homilies, or ‘Orations’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 3010, and Suppl.). There is
               an earlier version, preserved incomplete, and a thorough revision made by <ref rend="bold">Pawla of Edessa</ref>, in 623/4 in Cyprus (whither he had fled from the
               Persian occupation of the eastern Byzantine provinces). Subsequent light revisions to
               this were made by <ref rend="bold">Athanasios II</ref> and others. The following have
               been published so far (Greek numbering, the Syriac is different): Hom. 15, ‘On the

               28–31, ‘Theological Orations’ (2007), all providing both versions (further volumes
               are in preparation). The mss. of the two versions are described by A. Van Roey and
               H.  Moors, in <hi rend="italic">OLP</hi> 4 (1973), 121–33; 5 (1974), 79–126, and by
               A. Schmidt and M. Quaschning-Kirsch, in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>113 (2000), 87–114.
               Pawla’s revision is always transmitted in two parts, 1–30 and 31–47. The Scholia
               (attached to the Homilies) explaining Gregory’s allusions to Greek mythology were
               edited, with ET, by S. P. Brock (1971), with both versions. Other scholia etc. were
               discussed by A. de Halleux, in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>98 (1985), 103–47; 103
               (1990), 67–90, and by A. Schmidt, in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>111 (1998), 279–85. The
               Syriac revisions of the Homilies are mentioned by <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>,
               in Letters 17, 22, 42, and 43.</p>
                    <p>2. Letters (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 3032). According to <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref> (‘Book of Directions’, VII.9) 31 Letters circulated in Syriac
               translation, out of a much larger number in Greek. Smaller collections survive in two
               mss. of 8th/9th cent. (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,209 and 14,544), representing
               two different translations (unpublished).</p>
                    <p>3. Poems. The names of three translators are known, Candidatus of Amid (17 poems,
               done in 665, according to ms. Vat. Syr. 96), <ref rend="bold">Theodosios of
                  Edessa</ref>, a monk of the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref> and
               brother of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Dionysios</ref>, done in 802, according to Bar
               ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, vol. I, col. 363; and a certain Gabriel, mentioned
               in Timotheos I, Letter 24. Candidatus is also mentioned in a funerary inscription of
               his granddaughter Mariam, dated Sept. 760 (in the Vatican Museum, ed. Guidi, <hi rend="italic">Actes, X Congrès des Orientalistes</hi>, vol. 3 [1896], 73–82). A
               large collection of poems survives in ms. Vat. Syr. 105, ed. P. J. Bollig (1895), and
               smaller groupings in three mss. in the British Library, ed. H. Gismondi (1896). It is
               unclear whether any of these can be allocated to either Candidatus or Theodosios.</p>
                    <p>4. There is also a Syr. Orth. Anaphora attributed to Gregory (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 3097), ed. with LT, I. Hausherr, <hi rend="italic">Anaphorae

                    <p>A Syriac homily on Poverty is attributed to Gregory, but this has been shown

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Cath. since 605. Grigor originated from Prat d-Mayshan. Prior to his election he was
               a teacher of biblical interpretation at the School of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia</ref>.
               The Persian authorities, or more specifically Queen Shirin, are said to have
               intervened in his election. One of the main internal problems Grigor had to deal with
               was the crisis in the <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref> surrounding the
               controversial leadership of <ref rend="bold">Ḥenana of Adiabene</ref>. The synod
               convened by Grigor in 605 fully endorsed the commentaries (<hi rend="italic">puššāqe</hi>) and writings of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> as the
               main and even the sole authority, against which no one had the right to introduce
               alternative views. This strong statement must have targeted Ḥenana and his followers.
               Other decisions of the synod deal with the problem of wandering or independent monks,
               both male and female, and with the need to bring monasteries under episcopal
               authority.</p>
                    <p>After Cath. Grigor’s death, which occurred between 608 and 611 (Vööbus, 316–7), the
               patriarchal throne was vacant until 628 (the death of Emperor Khusrau II). During
               this nearly twenty-year long interregnum, <ref rend="bold">Babai the Great</ref> and
               Aba, Archdeacon of Seleucia, were in charge of the administration of the Ch. of E.
               From this period the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref> preserves a profession
               of faith that the bps. prepared for the Persian Emperor, in the context of a
               disputation with the Syr. Orth. (612).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Minor author, scribe and bp. of <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> (1510/12–1537). He was
               born as Yawseph in <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> of an Iberian ancestry. Yawseph may
               have lost his parents at an early age, after which he was sent to <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  al-Zaʿfarān</ref> where he was cared for by Patr. Yuḥanon bar Shayullāh and the
               Patr.’s mother Mariam. Yawseph became a monk in 1490 and was ordained priest in 1495.
               He spent some time in Dayro d-ʿAzrael, then moved between Ḥesno d-Kifo, <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>. Impressed by his
               learning and zeal, bp. Yaʿqub of Amid called him ‘the pride of the church’.</p>
                    <p>In 1510/12, Yawseph was consecrated bp. of Jerusalem and environs, then including
                  <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>, Aleppo, Ḥama, Tripoli, and parts of Ṣadad (with
               other parts being under the bp. of Nabk). As a bp., he took the name Grigorios. He
               managed to secure back mss. belonging to <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St. Mark</ref>
               which his predecessor, bp. Diosqoros Yaʿqub al-Yabrudī, had pawned. Grigorios visited
               the monasteries of Scetis (Egypt), including <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in
               1516. On that occasion he compiled a list of the recent acquisitions of Syriac
               liturgical mss. in Dayr al-Suryān (see Leroy). He also visited Ṣadad in 1527, Amid in
               1529–30, Aleppo in 1534, and Ṭur ʿAbdin in 1535. Earlier, a matrimonial case in Ṣadad
               caused a friction between him and Diosqoros ʿĪsā b. Ḥuriyya, bp. of Nabk and <ref rend="bold">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabash</ref>ī.</p>
                    <p>At a general meeting of all the Christians of Jerusalem in 1527, Grigorios was chosen
               to represent Jerusalem’s Christian communities in talks with the governor of
               Damascus, Lutfi Pasha. Shortly after, Grigorios obtained from the Pasha an edict to
               protect the civil rights of the Syr. Orth., Greek, Coptic, Armenian, Maron., and
               E.-Syr. Christians. During his bishopric, Grigorios obtained ca. ten governmental
               edicts from various officials, ensuring the rights of the Syr. Orth. in the Holy
               Places, the civil rights of all Christians in Palestine, and some in support of his
               ecclesiastical domain over the Syr. Orth. and their ‘Maronite and Nestorian
               followers’ (sic).</p>
                    <p>In 1532, Grigorios purchased a property from a Muslim named Yūsef b. Marʿī near
               Damascus Gate, Jerusalem, and established there a monastery which he called ‘The
               Gregorian Patriarchal Monastery of Jerusalem’ (a.k.a. Dayr al-ʿAdas). Grigorios died
               in Aleppo in 1537 and was buried at the Church of the Virgin.</p>
                    <p>Grigorios was a renowned scribe. He produced the patriarchal bull of a Synod that
               took place in Dayr al-Zaʿfarān on 28 Jan. 1532.</p>
                    <p>His literary works include: 1. Three <hi rend="italic">ḥusoye</hi> (Barsoum reported
               a ms. in Ḥesno d-Kifo’s Church); 2. Brief biographies of contemporary patriarchs and

                    <p>Italian Syriac scholar. One of the most eminent scholars in the philology of Semitic
               and Eastern Christian literatures, he taught at the University of Rome from 1876 to
               1919. Although since 1885 he devoted most of his energy to Ethiopian studies, he also
               offered important contributions to Syriac scholarship, particularly textual studies,
               such as his editions — mostly accompanied by annotated translations — of the first
               ‘Letter on the Ḥimyarite martyrs’ by <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun of Beth Arsham</ref>
               (1881); of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>’s homily ‘on the Seven Sleepers of
               Ephesus’ (1884–85); of <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>’s letter to the
               monks of Tell ʿAda (1886); of the Statutes of the <ref rend="bold">School of
                  Nisibis</ref> (1891), reedited decades later by A. Vööbus; of two fundamental
               historiographical works, the 6th cent. <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>
               (1903) and the 7th cent. ‘Chronicle of Khuzistan’ (a.k.a. ‘Guidi’s Anonymous
               Chronicle’, 1892 and 1903); of the Syriac Acts of the martyr Judas Cyriacus (1904);
               of <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref>’s Cathedral Homilies XCIX to CIII in <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>’s translation (PO 22.2, 1930). He is also to be
               credited with the discovery and first presentation of the E.-Syr. <ref rend="bold">Synodicon</ref> (1889), subsequently edited and translated by <ref rend="bold">J.-B. Chabot</ref> and <ref rend="bold">O. Braun</ref>, and with a series of
               critical remarks (1892) on, as well as the indispensable hagiographical index (1919)
               to, <ref rend="bold">P. Bedjan</ref>’s seven-volume <hi rend="italic">Acta Martyrum et
                  Sanctorum</hi>. Only the first two substantial items of this selection of his
               essays were reprinted in his <hi rend="italic">Raccolta di scritti</hi>, vol. 1. <hi rend="italic">Oriente cristiano I</hi>(Rome 1945, unfortunately interrupted after
               the first installment). Guidi also published brilliant essays on specific literary
               and historical themes connected with Syriac studies, such as his famous Paris lecture
               ‘L’historiographie chez les Sémites’ (1906), his Cairo lectures published as
               ‘L’Arabie anté-islamique’ (1921), and a steady stream of book reviews. In the course
               of a very busy life he formed relationships of friendly collaboration with several
               scholars belonging to the Syr. Churches staying in Rome for longer periods, such as
               the future Syr. Catholic Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref>, the
               Maron. priest <ref rend="bold">Gabriel Cardahi</ref>, and his Chaldean informers on a
               North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic dialect of Iraq, of which he published in his youth a
               succint linguistic description and two short texts (1883). No full list of his
               writings is available: the one up to 1911 in <hi rend="italic">Rivista degli Studi
                  Orientali</hi> 5 (1913), 77–89, was never completed and updated. The considerable
               library of Guidi combined with that of his Arabist son Michelangelo, which includes a
               rich collection of rare Syriac text editions, is now housed in the Department of
               Oriental Studies of the University of Rome ‘La Sapienza’.</p>

                    <p>Syriac scholar, specialist of Eastern Christian asceticism and monasticism. Antoine
               Guillaumont studied classics in Montpellier. Between periods of mobilization in the
               army, he obtained his <hi rend="italic">agrégation de lettres classiques</hi> in
               1943. He taught for two years in the Lycée of Monaco and subsequently was admitted to
               the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. He also took up a tenured teaching
               position at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, first in Hebrew and <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref>, later in Eastern Christianity. In 1977, he was elected a
               professsor in the prestigious College de France (1977–86), with a chair dedicated to
               ‘Christianity and Gnoses in the Pre-Islamic East’. In 1983, he became a member of the
               French Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. With his main focus on
               asceticism, he first turned to Coptic documents and particularly to the Sahidic
               fragments of the Coptic version of the ‘Asceticon’ of Abba Isaiah (<ref rend="bold">Isaiah of Scetis</ref>), which he published in 1956. His entire life was
               dedicated to a better understanding of asceticism, monasticism, and withdrawal from
               the world. As part of the broader cultural environment from which the ascetic
               movement emerged, he studied biblical texts from the Hellenistic period, which led to
               his collaboration on several books (Maccabees, Proverbs, Qohelet, the additions to
               Esther, Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon) for the French translation of the Bible
               edited by E. Dhorme (1956–59). He also collaborated on Psalms for the <hi rend="italic">Traduction œcuménique de la Bible</hi> (1975). He studied various
               gnostic texts and contributed to the first edition and translation of the ‘Gospel of
               Thomas’ (1959). Most of his studies, conferences, courses, and publications were
               dedicated to notions of asceticism, withdrawal, solitary life, spiritual fight, and
                  <hi rend="italic">acedia</hi>(‘listlessness’), which he studied in ascetic
               literature, including the ‘History of the Monks of Egypt’, the ‘Sayings of the Desert
               Fathers’ (Apophthegmata), the ‘Lausiac History’, and the Syriac ‘<ref rend="bold">Book
                  of Steps</ref>’, as well as in archeological remains in Northern Syria and Egypt.
               Of particular significance are his editions of the works of <ref rend="bold">Evagrius
                  of Pontus</ref>, based on the Greek and Eastern, especially Syriac sources. He
               published the ‘Kephalaia Gnostica’ (1958) as well as the following together with his
               wife Claire: the ‘Practical Treatise’ (1971), the ‘Gnosticon’ (1989), and (in
               collaboration with P. Géhin) ‘On the Thoughts’ (SC 438; 1998). He also published an
               important monograph on the ‘Kephalaia Gnostica’ (1962), in which he traced the
               far-reaching influence of Origenism and Evagrianism in Syr. Christianity, including
               such authors as <ref rend="bold">Babai the Great</ref> in the E.-Syr. and <ref rend="bold">Sṭephanos bar Ṣudayli</ref> in the W.-Syr. tradition. His last and
               posthumous book, <hi rend="italic">Un philosophe au désert, Évagre le Pontique</hi>
               (2004) is the culmination of his work on this important philosopher. For Guillaumont
               the literary study of these texts could not be disconnected from the places where
               ascetics lived. Using the texts and gleaning information from them, he was able to
               identify the site of Kellia, a center of eremitic life situated between Scetis and
               Nitria, where Evagrius lived during 14 years. Guillaumont directed archeological
               campaigns in Kellia from 1965 to 1969. In addition to the publication of the
               archeological reports, this archeological experience also formed the background for
               his volumes <hi rend="italic">Aux origines du monachisme chrétien</hi> (1979) and <hi rend="italic">Études sur la spiritualité de l’Orient Chrétien</hi> (1996), in
               which a number of his papers are brought together. A Festschrift was presented to him
               in 1988.</p>

                    <p>Notable Iraqi scholar, priest and educator. Yusuf Habbi was born in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> on 23 Dec. 1938. After attending the Chaldean Seminary School in
               Mosul he was sent to Rome (1954) to study, first at the Urbinian University, and then
               at the Lateran University where he wrote his doctorate (1966) on Patr. Yawsep Audo.
               On his return to Iraq (1967) he was engaged in both pastoral and academic work. In
               1972, with some colleagues he founded the periodical <hi rend="italic">Bayn
                  al-nahrayn</hi>, of which he remained an editor until his death in a car accident
               the night of 14/15 Oct. 2000. Also in 1972 he was elected to the Syriac Academy
               (later, the Syriac Corporation of the Iraqi Academy). From 1975–81 he taught Syriac
               and French at Mosul University, and then in 1982 he was appointed Associate Professor
               at the Pontifical Oriental Institute, Rome. From 1991 he was closely involved with
               the raising of the Patriarchal Seminary in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> to a
               Pontifical Faculty, named the Babel College of Philosophy and Theology, of which he
               became President. Particularly notable among his many publications was the edition of
                  <ref rend="bold">Bar Bahlul</ref>’s newly discovered ‘Book of Signs’ (1987). Besides
               writing two histories of the Ch. of E. (1989, 2001; both in Arabic), he published a
               new edition of the ‘Catalogue’ of <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> (1986), and Arabic
               translations of various <ref rend="bold">chronicles</ref> (<ref rend="bold">Eliya of
                  Nisibis</ref>, 1975; <hi rend="italic">Chronica Minora</hi>, 1983), and of the
                  <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref> (1999). He also contributed a number of
               important articles in French and Italian publications.</p>

                    <p>Literature that tells the stories of saints. Hagiography was not biography, even
               though often including such material. Rather, its purpose was to present its subjects
               in terms that made clear their holiness. Hence it employed literary conventions,
               motifs, and themes that identified its men or women with biblical models, and above
               all with gospel models of Christ. The saint was always presented as one who imitated
               Christ, whether by works of healing, teaching, or ministry in life, or by a holy
               death. It could be written about historical persons or legendary figures, but always
               it presented and conformed the holy person’s life and works to familiar models that
               emerged over the late antique period: the holy bishop, abbot, or monk; the holy nun,
               widow, or penitent harlot; the holy layman or laywoman who lived an exceptional life
               of good works and asceticism. Syriac hagiography emerged as a sophisticated literary
               genre during the 5th cent. and took various forms: individual lives (<hi rend="italic">vitae</hi>) of saints, resembling biographical narratives and deeply
               influenced by Greek biographical traditions, such as those about <ref rend="bold">Rabbula of Edessa</ref> or <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>; collections
               of saints’ stories, often short vignettes, including personal encounters, such as
                  <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>’s ‘Lives of the Eastern Saints’ (W. Syr.,
               written 560s) or <ref rend="bold">Toma of Marga</ref>’s ‘Book of Governors’ (E. Syr.,
               9th cent.); personal memoirs, such as <ref rend="bold">Sahdona</ref>’s of the 7th cent.
               holy woman Shirin (E. Syr.). Saints’ stories traveled freely across linguistic,
               geographical, and political boundaries in the ancient Christian world. Thus
               hagiography appeared in literary forms that mutually interacted across languages.
               Hagiographical writings about Syr. saints were written in Greek (e.g., by <ref rend="bold">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref>) as well as Syriac, and both kinds might be
               translated into Latin and further into other languages. The Edessan Martyrs, Shemʿun
               the Stylite, St. Febronia of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, the anonymous <ref rend="bold">Man of God</ref> (later named Alexius), and St. Pelagia the harlot, are
               figures both historical and legendary whose stories, originating in Syriac, are found
               in every major calendar of Christian saints. In turn, there is a large body of
               hagiography translated into Syriac from other languages, already during the 5th and
               6th cent., beginning with <ref rend="bold">Athanasius</ref>’s ‘Life of Antony’, ‘the
               Sayings of the Desert Fathers’, and Theodoret of Cyrrhus’s ‘History of the Monks of
               Syria’.</p>

               (4170 m.) and Sat Dag (3810 m.), and the highlands around them, cut by the gorges of
               the Great Zab River and its tributaries. The spelling <hi rend="italic">Hakkiari</hi>
               is also found in English sources. In modern Turkey <hi rend="italic">Hakkâri</hi> is
               the name of a province and of its capital town, the former Julamerk (Cölemerik).
               There is no Christian population now (only more or less ruined churches), but until
               1915 Hakkari was the homeland of the majority of Christians belonging to the Ch. of
               E.</p>
                    <p>Within what is now Hakkari the dioceses of Beth Dasen and Beth Bgash are known from
               the 5th cent., and the evidence of local saints, such as Mar Zayʿa whose cult was in
               Jilu, may take the church history of the region back to the 4th cent. But there is a
               long period of silence until ca. 1400 when, according to tradition, Hakkari was
               populated by Christians from ‘Assyria’, that is, the <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>
               plain, fleeing the ravages of Timur. The earliest report of a patr. of the Ch. of E.
               in Hakkari (in the village of Khananis near Kochanes) dates from 1617–19, although
               the official tradition of the church credits the removal of the patriarchal see to
               Hakkari to a Patr. Denḥa (numbered as Mar Shemʿon XIII or XV) who held office
               1662–1700.</p>
                    <p>The majority population of Hakkari was always Kurdish, and until the mid-19th
               century, Assyrian Christians were subject to the local Kurdish chiefs with their
               fortresses at Julamerk and Bashkale. Well-documented massacres of Christians in
               1843–46 were partly the consequence of intra-Kurdish wars, another consequence of
               which was the gradual imposition of Turkish rule on the region. Officially, Hakkari
               was a <hi rend="italic">sanjak</hi> within the <hi rend="italic">vilayet</hi>of Van
               (except 1880–88 when it was itself a <hi rend="italic">vilayet</hi>) with the seat of
               the local governor (<hi rend="italic">mutessarif</hi>) at Bashkale. Even so, only the
               so-called <hi rend="italic">rayat</hi> areas on the periphery of Hakkari were subject
               to direct Turkish rule. In central Hakkari were the ‘<hi rend="italic">ashiret</hi>’
               areas in which the central government operated only through the Patr. Mar Shemʿon,
               from whom taxes were collected and to whom a salary was paid (both irregularly). A
               reasonable estimate in 1886 put the population of Hakkari at 70,000 Kurds and 50,000
               Assyrian Christians (although higher numbers of Christians were often quoted).</p>
                    <p>The principal Assyrian <hi rend="italic">rayat</hi> areas were: Gawar, Shamsdin
               (including the village of Marbishu), Berwar, and Bashkale. The <hi rend="italic">ashiret</hi> districts were: Upper Tiari, Lower Tiari (including the vilage of
               Ashitha), Tkhuma, Baz, and Jilu. Each of the <hi rend="italic">ashiret</hi>
               populations, usually called tribes, was autonomous under its <hi rend="italic">malek</hi> (chief). The Patr.’s village of Kochanes and a few other groups of
               villages (Walto, Tal, Diz) were also part of the <hi rend="italic">ashiret</hi> area,
               although not always considered ‘tribal’. The <hi rend="italic">malek</hi>s owed a
               feudal allegiance to the Patr. but were often disaffected. Differences among the
               dress, dialect, and even physiognomy of the tribes were generally commented on by
               Western writers. Even today and even in the <ref rend="bold">diaspora</ref> tribal
               identities are strong among Assyrians. The membership of the Ancient Church of the
               East, for example, has a large proportion of Lower Tiari families.</p>
                    <p>The want of good government in Hakkari is a theme in 19th-cent. reports on the area.
               Christians and Kurds managed a tense coexistence, but it was characterized by
               continual feuds, disputes over sheep-stealing, and robbery of each other and of
               travellers. Christian grievances were directed more often at the Turkish government
               than the Kurds. The government was, however, by nature hostile to Christians as a
               disloyal non-Muslim element in the population, and the fact that their grievances
               were often channeled through western missionaries and consular officials increased
               this hostility.</p>
                    <p>Ethnic cleansing began in Oct. 1914 with an order for the deportation of Christians
               from Hakkari. With the outbreak of war, this became during 1914–15 an organized
               destruction of <hi rend="italic">rayat</hi> villages by Turkish troops with the
               assistance of Kurdish irregulars, in which many Assyrian civilians were killed.
               Apparently after a decision by the Assyrians in May 1915 to join the war on the
               Russian and British side, a full-scale campaign against them was launched by Haydar
               Bey, the <hi rend="italic">vali</hi> of Mosul. Heavy fighting drove the Assyrian
               remnant to retreat into the high mountains, and then to escape as best they could
               into Persia. At the end of Sept. 1915 it was reported that 25,000 had reached Salmas
               (north of <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref>), including Mar Shimun. The men of Jilu had
               withdrawn to Persia earlier in the year, and in all an estimated 40,000 Assyrians
               from Hakkari eventually found their way to Urmia.</p>
                    <p>There were attempts to resettle the area by the Assyrian mountaineers in 1920 and
               1922–24. The latter ended with the Turkish army driving the settlers back over the
               Iraqi border. When in July 1925 this border was drawn by the League of Nations and
               Hakkari finally awarded to Turkey, there was an end to ideas of return to the old
               homeland.</p>

               College in Rome from 1620 to 1628 and concluded this period with the publication of a
               short Syriac grammar (<hi rend="italic">Linguae syriacae sive chaldaicae
                  institutio</hi>, 1628), intended for students of the Maronite College who had
               difficulty with the high academic level of <ref rend="bold">Jirjis ʿAmīra</ref>’s
               grammar. Upon his return to Lebanon, he started working as a diplomat for the Emir
               Fakhr al-Dīn who, in his resistance against the Ottomans, forged an alliance between
               the Maronites and the Druzes, but was captured (1634) and executed in Istanbul. Fakhr
               al-Dīn’s demise forced al-Ḥāqilānī to return to Italy, where he taught Arabic and
               Syriac at the Sapienza College in Rome, spent some time in Florence, and was
               appointed professor of oriental languages at Pisa. In the 1630s he was involved in
               the Paris Polyglot, to which he contributed the Syr. and Arabic text of the book of
               Ruth, with LT, and the Arabic text of 3 Maccabees. In or around 1645 al-Ḥāqilānī was
               appointed professor at the Collège Royal (the later Collège de France) in Paris. In
               1653 he returned to Rome, where he taught on behalf of the ‘Propaganda Fide’, before
               being appointed, in 1660, Scriptor of the Vatican Library. In this position he
               prepared the first catalogue of Syriac and Arabic mss. He died in 1664.</p>

               subscriptions of the Ḥarqlean Gospels (Kiraz, <hi rend="italic">CESG</hi>, vol. 4,
               369), Acts, and the Pauline epistles, the translation was executed ‘at the Enaton of
               (i.e., near) Alexandria, the great city, in the holy Convent of the Antonines … in
               the year 927 of Alexander, in the fourth indiction (i. e., 615/16)’. The Ḥarqlean
               Version is mentioned by <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> in his ‘Storehouse of
               Secrets’ (<hi rend="italic">Awṣar roze</hi>), proem, in his Ecclesiastical History
               (I,50 = vol. 1, col. 267), and by <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, Chronicle, X,25
               = vol. IV 391.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The Characteristic Features</label>
                    <p>The characteristic features of the Ḥarqlean version are the decisive turn towards the
               Greek (‘mirror translation’) and the introduction of the philological and thus
               ‘critical’ dimension into the history of the Syriac NT. The method of recension
               sketched in the subscriptions remains ambiguous (esp. the role of the Philoxenian);
               the result, however, is clear: Tumo prepared a NT text that did not exist before;
               i.e. he produced a recension of the NT. This recension was based on a translation of
               an existing Greek model and supplemented by textual material drawn from additional
               Greek mss. In the same way, the Syro-Hexapla is based on an existing Greek model (the
               Hexaplaric Septuagint recension) and supplemented by textual material drawn from
               Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion (and others). The new philological and ‘critical’
               dimension is provided by the <hi rend="italic">distinctive</hi> presentation of the
               additional material. It is located in the margins or in the main text (marked with
               asterisks) in order not to mix the textual traditions put together in this recension.
               This <hi rend="italic">distinctive</hi> presentation allows the additional material
               to be read in context as variants of the <hi rend="italic">Graeca veritas</hi>.
               Additions to and omissions from Tumo’s Greek model could be presented in the main
               text; exchanges of words or passages had to be presented in the margin and connected
               to the corresponding word in the text by a graphic sign. The <hi rend="italic">obelos</hi> is used for the sake of translation technique to mark Syriac words
               which do not match the Greek <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi> but are necessary for an
               intelligible rendering of the Greek. By this way of quoting the additional material
               and using ‘critical’ signs, Tumo is a pupil of Origen; from a modern point of view,
               he attached a ‘critical’ apparatus to his version. Of course Tumo was not a modern
               critic, but he was aware of the non-uniformity of the Greek text. He knew about
               different textual traditions and that translating a single Greek ms. (like <ref rend="bold">Polykarpos</ref>, who prepared the Philoxenian) would provide only an
               imperfect knowledge of the Greek NT text.</p>
                    <p>Besides the recensional features, a revisional relation between the Ḥarqlean Version
               and the Philoxenian is reported in the subscriptions of the Ḥarqlean Version.
               Although this report is not detailed enough, Tumo could have used the earlier version
               as the starting point of his own. An attractive feature of the earlier version was
               its relation to Caesarea in Palestine and to the famous library of Pamphilus, which
               is reported in the Ḥarqlean subscription to the Pauline letters. A revisional
               relation to the Philoxenian would have brought Tumo’s own version in line with the
               Caesarean origin of the Syro-Hexapla and would have supplied the whole Miaphysite
               translation project with one uniform authority.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The Historical Setting</label>
                    <p>As J. Gwynn suggested (‘Paulus [48] Tellensis’, <hi rend="italic">DCB</hi> 4 [1887],
               266–71, at 267), the instigative historical setting of the laborious translation
               project could have been the reunion of the Syrian and Coptic Miaphysites after
               decades of schisma dating from the time of the Syrian Patr. <ref rend="bold">Peter of
                  Kallinikos</ref> (581–91) and the Coptic Patriarch Damian (578–606). Although no
               proof can be given, Gwynn’s suggestion is supported by the common date 616 for the
               reunion and the completion of the Ḥarqlean Version. This suggestion, however, puts a
               special linguistic perspective on the Ḥarqlean Version. The reunion had to be
               performed completely in Greek; and both parties had to determine the authoritative
               Greek text of the Scriptures for reunion. This text had to be of ‘ecumenical’, not of
               local currency. For the OT, Origen’s Hexaplaric Septuagint recension (handed down by
               Pamphilus and <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref>) could easily be accepted by both
               parties; for the NT, no such work of Origen existed, and the text had to be
               determined by the Miaphysites themselves. This text became the Greek model of the
               Ḥarqlean Version. According to this perspective, the Ḥarqlean Version came into being
               after the determination of the Greek model as the translation and inner-Syriac
               promulgation of the approved Greek NT text. The recensional as well as the revisional
               imprint on the Ḥarqlean version were added during or after translation, when
               comparison with additional Greek mss. (and with the Philoxenian) was made. Another
               possibility is that the Ḥarqlean margin was already an integral part of the Greek
               text established by the Syrian and Coptic Miaphysites in order to quote (i.e. to
               include into the reunion) different textual traditions of both parties.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The History of the Version Reflected by the Mss.</label>
                    <p>After the rise of Islam, the version’s ‘ecumenical’ frame of reference was lost and
               the version itself was considered as the ‘Greek’ (Bar ʿEbroyo in his Scholia to the
               NT). The ‘ecumenical’ perspective of the Ḥarqlean Version was replaced by a
               scientific and philological attitude. Due to the complicated lay-out of the version,
               not all scribes were capable of transmitting the text properly; some of them omitted
               the marginal quotations and the <hi rend="italic">asterisks/obeloi</hi> completely,
               thus mixing the readings Tumo intended to keep separate. The philologists were not
               interested in preserving the original text but in updating it according to the
               current Greek text of the New Testament, which was the increasingly dominant
               Byzantine text. This development created ‘corrected’ models (hyparchetypes) and faded
               out the original non- and pre- Byzantine part of the version.</p>
                    <p>Due to the large number of mss., the revisional development can be traced best in the
               Gospel mss. The total is ca. 100 from the 8th to the 19th cent., but only ca. 20 mss.
               are furnished with the marginal and asterisked additions. Ms. Vat. Syr. 268 (8th/9th
               cent.) is singled out by an undeveloped stage of text, which preserved a large number
               of non-Byzantine readings. The majority of the witnesses reflect the version’s
               development towards the Greek Byzantine text; unfortunately, the oldest dated ms. of
               the Gospels (ms. Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana Plut. I.40; 757) is of this type. This
               first revisional stage of the version is well represented in further mss. of the
               first millennium, e.g. by Vat. Syr. 267 (8th cent.), Harvard Syr.  16 (8th/9th
               cent.), Brit. Libr. Add. 7163 (9th/10th  cent.), Mingana Syr. 124 (9th/10th cent.),
               and Chester Beatty Syr. 3 (1177, copied from a model of 841).</p>
                    <p>In the 12th cent. the revisional development entered a new stage with the activity of
                  <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref> (d. 1171). Again, Gospel mss. provide
               the information. The subscriptions, which report his revision (ms. Oxford, New Coll.
               334; 12th/13th cent. and London, Brit. Libr. Add. 17,124; 1233/34; see Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue … British Museum</hi>, vol. 1, 42) do not mention Greek
               mss.; it probably relies on several ‘corrected’ models of the version itself.
               Essential features are the further reduction of the marginal readings and critical
               signs (though some completely new are added), the inversion of many text/margin
               readings, and the introduction of the Pericope on the Adulteress (Jn 7:53–8:11).</p>
                    <p>The extreme rarity of mss. for Acts and the Epistles prevents us from tracing a
               revisional development in these parts of the NT. There are only two mss. from the
               first millennium, ms. Jerusalem, St. Mark 37 (Pauline epistles) and ms. London, Brit.
               Libr. Add. 14,474 (Catholic Epistles), which are of the 9th cent. Two later mss.
               cover the entire NT with the exception of Revelation: ms. Cambridge, Add. 1700
               (1069/70) and ms. Oxford, New Coll. 333 (12th/13th cent.). Fortunately, all except
               the Cambridge ms. are furnished with marginal and asterisked variants. Revelation is
               represented by ca. ten late mss., among which Mardin Orth. 36/2 (13th cent., ed. by
               A. Vööbus as no. 35/2) is furnished with a subscription and with the full range of
               marginal and asterisked variants. Important steps in the version’s history are:
               1.  the creation of a ‘Passiontide Harmony’ composed of literal segments of the
               single Gospels. It is from the 9th cent. and attributed to Daniel of Beth Baṭin (near
                  <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref>); 2. the <hi rend="italic">liturgical</hi> use of the
               version, which entered the lectionaries. This gives color to the version’s
               appreciation among the Syrians as the ‘correct’ and ‘ecumenical’ text of the NT; 3.
               the adoption of the version by the <ref rend="bold">Masora</ref> (connected with the
                  <ref rend="bold">Qarqaphto</ref> monastery near <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref>) in
               the 8th/9th cent.; 4. the production of <hi rend="italic">bilingual</hi> codices in
               Syriac/Arabic <ref rend="bold">Garshuni</ref> (e.g. Vat. Syr. 271 and Paris, Bibl. Nat.
               Syr. 57); and 5. the attachment of extensive exegetical scholia taken from patristic
               authorities (e.g. Mingana Syr. 105 and 480; Manchester, J. Rylands Univ. Library, no.
               10).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The History of Research</label>
                    <p>The history of research started with the <hi rend="italic">Editio princeps</hi>
               published by Joseph White 1778–1803; it was based mainly on one single ms. (New Coll.
               333, with variants of mss. New Coll. 334 and Bodl. Or. 361). From the very beginning
               scholars were confronted with the question of the version’s identity (Philoxenian or
               Ḥarqlean). According to White’s interpretation of the subscriptions it was the
               Philoxenian version he published, which <ref rend="bold">Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref> reissued
               by only attaching the marginal and asterisked readings. G. H. Bernstein in 1837
               considered White’s text to be a separate version, though a thorough revision, of the
               Philoxenian. The question remained open until the publication of Philoxenos’s late
               writings, which provided genuine Philoxenian quotations of the NT (especially his
               commentary on the prologue of St. John’s Gospel, ed. by A. de Halleux [CSCO 380,
               1977]). Bernstein’s view turned out to be substantially correct; the <ref rend="bold">Philoxenian version</ref> itself is considered lost.</p>
                    <p>A new approach to the Greek background of the Ḥarqlean Version was launched by B.
               Aland, who successfully reconstructed the Greek <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi> of the
               Ḥarqlean major Catholic Epistles and the writings of Paul. The version’s Greek model
               can be traced to a group of 10th–15th-cent. minuscule mss. (1611, 1505, 2138, 2495
               according to Gregory and Aland), the ancestry of which is not a descendent of the
               Greek model itself but of a ms. akin to this model having a common 5th/6th-cent.
               ancestry (B. Aland 1986, introduction). The knowledge of the Greek model opened a new
               perspective on Tumo’s method of revison, with two principal issues: 1. Tumo is a <hi rend="italic">translator</hi>, who faithfully follows his Greek <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi>; the marginal and asterisked annotations derive from different Greek
               mss., which supply the version with variant readings of the <hi rend="italic">Graeca
                  veritas</hi>; 2. the revisional relation to the Philoxenian (reported in the
               subscriptions) is rather on the Syriac than on the Greek level. There was a shift
               from a fairly exact rendering to a ‘mirror translation’; the Greek background of both
               versions largely remained the same. These results derive from a text-critical study
               and from a reedition of the Ḥarqlean Version, which is based on a new important ms.
               (Jerusalem, St. Mark 37; 9th cent.). G. Zuntz’s still dominant approach to the
               revisional relation between the Philoxenian and Ḥarqlean versions is solely based on
               an interpretation of the subscriptions and guided too much by the term ‘revision’
               instead of ‘translation’.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Editions</label>
                    <p>The complex structure of the Ḥarqlean Version, its liability to distortion, the
               revisional development, and the scanty attestation of the Praxapostolos confront
               editors with not a few problems. Not surprisingly, most of the Ḥarqlean editions are
               one-ms.-publications. A comprehensive critical edition of the Gospels, which sets out
               the revisional development of the version in some detail, is much to be desired.

                    <p>Syr./Hebrew Ḥārān; Latin Carrhae; Arabic Ḥarran. Ancient city in Mesopotamia,
               approximately 45 km south-southeast of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>. Residence, for
               brief periods in the 8th cent., of Syr. Orth. patriarchs. The first city built after
               the Flood according to a tradition recorded by the Arab geographer Yāqūt in his <hi rend="italic">Muʿjam al-buldān</hi> and the place where Abraham and his family
               sojourned according to the Book of Genesis, Ḥarran had become known as a center for
               the cult of the moon god Sin by the 14th cent. BC. Because of its strategic
               importance as a frontier town, the Christian emperors usually refrained from
               interfering in the religious life of Ḥarran, which remained a stronghold of paganism.
               When the pilgrim Egeria visited Ḥarran in 383, the town had a Christian bp., and the
               house of Abraham, which stood outside the city, had been turned into a church, but
               the population of the city, she tells us, probably with some exaggeration, was wholly
               pagan. The Greek Fathers refer to Ḥarran as Hellenopolis, ‘the city of the (pagan)
               Greeks’; the Syriac <ref rend="bold">Life of Ephrem</ref>likewise calls it ‘the city of
               the pagans’ (<hi rend="italic">Ḥārān mdittā d-ḥanpe</hi>). Some have argued that it
               was in Ḥarran that Simplicius and his Neoplatonist companions settled upon their
               return from Persia where they had sought refuge after the closure of their school in
               Athens by Justinian in 529. Taken by the Arabs in 639/40, Ḥarran briefly became the
               seat of the caliphate under the last (eastern) Umayyad Marwān II (744–750). It was
               probably early on under Arab rule, before the 8th cent., that the Syriac work
               entitled the ‘Prophecies of the pagan philosophers in brief’ was written, inviting
               the pagans of Ḥarran to convert to Christianity. According to Ibn al-Nadīm, it was at
               the time of a visit by Caliph al-Maʾmūn in 830 that the people of the town identified
               themselves with the Sabians (Ṣābiʾ) mentioned in the Qurʾān, so as to escape
               persecution by claiming to be a ‘people of the book’. Ḥarran was considered a center
               of pagan Greek learning under the Abbasids, especially for the mathematical sciences.
               The Ḥarranians were probably the last group of non-Christians who continued to use
                  <ref rend="bold">Syriac</ref>. In his Lexicon, <ref rend="bold">Bar Bahlul
               </ref>refers to the Syriac dialect specific to Ḥarran. <ref rend="bold">Thābit b.
                  Qurra</ref> (836–901), the most famous of the ‘Sabian’ scholars, still wrote some
               of his works in Syriac, which were known to and were quoted by <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref>. Ḥarran became the principal seat of the Numayrids in the 11th cent.
               and remained an important city under the Artuqids, Zangids, and Ayyubids, but more or
               less disappears from history after it was taken by the Mongols in 1260 and was
               evacuated by them in 1271.</p>
                    <p>The first known bp. of the city is Barses, who was made metropolitan of Edessa in
               361. His successors include Vitus, who attended the Council of Constantinople in 381,
               Daniel, a cousin of <ref rend="bold">Hiba</ref> of Edessa (attested 444, 449), and
               John, who was at the Council of Chalcedon (451). At least three of their Chalcedonian
               successors would engage in writing against the Miaphysites, namely Constantine and
               Leon in the 8th cent. — who received replies in Syriac from a Miaphysite bp. called
                  <ref rend="bold">Eliya</ref> — and, more famously, <ref rend="bold">Theodoros Abū
                  Qurra</ref> (ca. 755 – ca. 830).</p>
                    <p>As Miaphysite bishops of Ḥarran before the Arab conquest, we know of Yuḥanon
               (mentioned in 502/3, banished by Emperor Justin in 519), Sergius bar Karyo (ca. 557 –
               ca. 578, translator of <ref rend="bold">John bar Aphtonia</ref>’s biography of <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> into Syriac), and Shemʿun (in 617/8). Before
               the Arab conquest, the main Syr. Orth. church in Ḥarran was confiscated and given to
               the Melkites by Emperor Maurice (582–602). Later, we hear of a new Syr. Orth.
               cathedral being completed just before 700. Bp. Iwannis of Ḥarran (d. 755) was elected
               Patr. in 740 on the eve of the transfer of the caliphate to Ḥarran. Of his two
               successors as patr., both later considered illegitimate, Isḥaq (755–56) had also been
               bp. of Ḥarran, and Athanasios Sandaloyo (756–58) was murdered in Ḥarran. Bp. Dawid of
               Ḥarran (attested 847, 874) may be the author of the Syriac Chronicle of 846 (Palmer,
                  <hi rend="italic">The seventh century in the West-Syrian chronicles</hi>, 83). The
               last known Syr. Orth. bp. of Ḥarran is Ephrem, heard of when the Armenians asked for
               access to an altar in the Syr. Orth. church in Ḥarran in 1252.</p>
                    <p>The E.-Syr. see of Ḥarran, attested between the 7th and 11th cent. and suffragan to
                  <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, counted among its occupants the canonist <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</ref>(early 9th  cent.) and the future Cath.
               Sabrishoʿ II (transferred from Ḥarran to Damascus before 823, then Cath.
               831–835).</p>
                    <p>Among the ruins of Ḥarran, dotted today with beehive-shaped adobe houses of the
               Bedouin Arabs who settled here in the 19th cent., are those of a large basilica
               church located near the northeastern end of the oval-shaped medieval city.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>British New Testament scholar, Syriac scholar, textual critic, and paleographer, who
               was instrumental in creating the modern field of Syriac Studies. Although he started
               his academic career at Cambridge as a mathematician, he soon discovered a life long
               interest in Christian origins and New Testament studies that eventually led to an
               appointment in paleography at Cambridge (UK), as well as positions in Biblical
               Languages and Ecclesiastical History at Haverford College (USA), New Testament at
               Johns Hopkins (USA), and as curator of mss. at the John Rylands Library in Manchester
               (UK). Before and after his time in Manchester, Rendel Harris served as director of
               the Woodbrooke Institute, Birmingham (UK), where he was able to combine his love for
               ancient textual studies and Quaker spirituality.</p>
                    <p>Rendel Harris was an independent thinker and was often considered idiosyncratic in
               his scholarship. He did not allow prevailing trends in Early Christian Studies to
               necessarily guide his own research. For instance, he was a very early advocate of
               understanding the beginnings of Christianity to descend both from Second Temple and
               post-70 CE Judaism(s), all the while pursuing the ways and means that these early
               Christian writers then separated themselves from those same forms of Judaism. He
               willingly pursued the social history behind the variant textual traditions he
               studied.</p>
                    <p>Rendel Harris’s abiding interest in collecting, editing and decoding ancient
               Christian manuscripts, Greek and Latin as well as Coptic, Syriac, Armenian, and
               Persian, led him on travels all over the Middle East including extensive stays in the
               libraries of the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref> at Mt. Sinai, and
               the Library of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>. On
               one trip (1888–89), while on leave from Haverford College, he collected, imported,
               and then donated to that college several dozen manuscripts. Over the years he
               traveled, collected, and donated or sold many more manuscripts to the John Rylands
               Library as well as to Harvard and Birmingham (Mingana collection). Harris is probably
               most noted, among Syriac scholars, for his publication of the Syriac <ref rend="bold">Odes of Solomon</ref>, which he discovered among some mss. from Mesopotamia (and
               subsequently republished, with a more extensive commentary and new translation, in
               collaboration with <ref rend="bold">A. Mingana</ref>). Among his other important work
               for Syriac studies was the collaborative work he conducted at St. Catherine’s
               Monastery on the Sinaitic Syriac palimpsest, which the independent scholarly sisters,
               Agnes S. Lewis and Margaret D. Gibson (see <ref rend="bold">Smith, A. and M.</ref>),
               discovered there. Together with R. L. Bensly and <ref rend="bold">F. C. Burkitt</ref>,
               Rendel Harris, Lewis and Gibson, transcribed, collated, annotated, and eventually
               published this earliest extant Syriac New Testament ms. It was also at St Catherine’s
               that he discovered the Syriac translation of the Apology of <ref rend="bold">Aristides</ref>, lost in Greek</p>

                    <p>New Testament scholar; professor at General Theological Seminary of New York
               (1908–17) and at Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, MA (1917–46); Syriac
               scholar. William Henry Paine Hatch was born in Camden, New Hampshire, in 1875. He
               studied theology at Harvard University and at Union Theological Seminary in New York.
               His main interest was in the Greek mss. of the NT, although he occasionally included
               in his work descriptions and photographs of Syriac mss. In 1922–23, while he was a
               visiting professor at the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem, he
               traveled to the monasteries of the Egyptian Wadi al-Natrun in search of Syriac and
               Coptic mss., but he was able to obtain only a few Coptic folios from St. Macarius
               Monastery. After his retirement, in 1946, Hatch moved back to New Hampshire. He died
               in Randolph, NH in 1972.</p>
                    <p>Hatch’s major and lasting publication in the field of Syriac studies is his <hi rend="italic">Album of Dated Syriac Manuscripts</hi> (1946). It contains 200
               facsimiles, each representing a page of a dated Syriac ms., in the following <ref rend="bold">scripts</ref>: Esṭrangela, Serṭo, E.-Syr., Melk., and <ref rend="bold">Christian Palestinian Aramaic</ref>. For the period up to the year 1000, all
               known dated mss. (more than 100) were included; for the period from the 11th to the
               16th cent. selections were made. In the 60 years of its existence Hatch’s <hi rend="italic">Album</hi> has proven to be an invaluable guide whenever scholars
               need to estimate the date of undated mss. Along with the facsimiles and Hatch’s
               meticulous descriptions, the <hi rend="italic">Album</hi>’s introductory chapters,
               which summarize the state of the art in various subfields of the study of Syriac
               mss., have created a foundation and a framework of reference for all subsequent
               scholarly work in Syriac paleography and ms. studies.</p>

               the wording of the definition of the Council of Chalcedon (451). The first among the
               39 canons addresses the problem of the ‘Messalians’; with their actions against

               these years by the Miaphysites (see <ref rend="bold">Aḥudemmeh of Balad</ref>). Most of
               the other canons are of a disciplinary and a general cultural nature, such as no. 37,

                <div type="body">
                    <p>School director and exegete. Ḥenana came from the province of <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref> to study at the <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref> during the
               time of <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref> (d. 569). After serving as a
               teacher in the School, Ḥenana became its director ca. 571. The School flourished
               under his leadership, for a time. He had a following of some 800 students and updated
               the School’s statutes (590). However, the School experienced decline near the end of
               Ḥenana’s tenure as director, marked by a dramatic exodus of students and teachers
               from the School. The problems were apparently triggered by the theological and
               political controversies surrounding Ḥenana. Reputed to be a follower of Origen and a
               Chalcedonian sympathizer who had abandoned the orthodox theological tradition of such
               teachers as <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, he was the subject of veiled
               attacks in synods held between 585 and 612 (see <ref rend="bold">Synodicon
                  Orientale</ref>, ed. Chabot, 393, 400, 457–61), and was openly denounced by <ref rend="bold">Babai the Great</ref>. His controversial leadership of the School also
               created tensions between the E.-Syr. church hierarchy and the Persian government. The
               oft-repeated assertions that Ḥenana was responsible for introducing spiritual
               (‘allegorical’) exegesis into the E.-Syr. tradition and for bringing <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref> into prominence in the Ch. of E. are ill-founded. Though
               the influence of Chrysostom on E.-Syr. exegesis in the 6th cent. is undeniable, no
               clear evidence of Ḥenana’s reliance on Chrysostom exists, and Ḥenana is merely one of
               a number of E.-Syr. practitioners of spiritual exegesis during the 6th–7th cent. The
               only extant works are two tracts explaining liturgical feasts, On Golden Friday and
               On the Rogation. <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad</ref> is our main source for extracts from
               Ḥenana’s exegetical works. Yet by his literary work and in his leadership of the
               School he significantly influenced E.-Syr. exegesis, theological discourse, and
               liturgy.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>credits Ḥenana with having written a number of
               commentaries on scripture, homilies, expositions of and expansions to the liturgy,
               and theological tracts, but his works were banned and mainly lost. Though Ḥenana was
               undoubtedly a controversial figure, the controversy surrounding him during and after
               his life time owed much to the impact of larger trends in the Ch. of E. Shifting
               intellectual, theological, and spiritual movements, along with changing political
               circumstances, provide the backdrop against which his reputation must be seen.</p>

                    <p>Cath. since 685/6; author of a law book and of exegetical homilies. In the 7th year
               of his tenure (692/3) Ḥenanishoʿ was deposed by Yoḥannan bp. of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, who had the support of Caliph ʿAbd al-Malik. Only partly recovered
               from ill-treatment (whence he was called <hi rend="italic">ḥgirā</hi> ‘the lame’), he
               withdrew to the Monastery of Yawnan (Jonah) near <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, where he
               died from the plague and was buried. Yoḥannan ruled as counter-patriarch for only a
               brief period (less than two years), but Ḥenanishoʿ was not able to fully resume his
               position, and the patriarchal throne remained vacant for several years.</p>
                    <p>A law book under Ḥenanishoʿ’s name is preserved in ms. Alqosh Syr. 169, the primary
               source for the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. Organized in 25 chapters and
               entitled ‘Juridical decisions’ (<hi rend="italic">dine</hi>), the collection deals
               mainly with matrimonial and hereditary law, and reflects for the most part (in
               particular in ch. 1 to 17) the work of the patriarchal tribunal (ed. Sachau; see also
               Dauvillier). Some letters of the Cath. have been incorporated in the collection as
               well.</p>
                    <p>A very different work by Ḥenanishoʿ, probably a collection of prose homilies on the
               Gospels, which may go back to his activities as biblical interpreter prior to his
               election as Cath., has not been preserved in direct transmission. Reinink, however,
               has been able to identify several extracts from it in the following sources: 1. ms.
               Vat. Syr. 504 (a 19th-cent. copy of the 16th-cent. ms. Diyarbakır 113), ff. 63v–65v
               (21 extracts); 2. NT Commentary of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> (2
               extracts); 3. <ref rend="bold">Gannat Bussāme</ref> (24 extracts); and 4. the prose
               Commentary of <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq Qardaḥe Shbadnaya</ref> (6 extracts). On the basis
               of these extracts, which occasionally overlap, Reinink could sketch the general
               profile of the work as a witness to E.-Syr. NT exegesis in the late 7th cent., and
               compare Ḥenanishoʿ’s exegesis with that of his younger contemporary <ref rend="bold">Aba II of Kashkar</ref> (d. 751).</p>
                    <p>The several other works that are attributed to Ḥenanishoʿ by either ʿAmr b. Mattā or
                  <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> give some impression of his multifaceted
               interests and abilities. They include, among other things: a biography of his
               contemporary Sargis Dwadha (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi> Wright), who lived near
               Kashkar; a treatise ‘On the twofold use of the school’; a commentary on the Analytics
               of <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>; and a ‘Book on the causes of that which exists’.
               Only from the latter work do a few fragments survive (see Reinink, 74). The other
               works have left no traces.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of Lashom and subsequently Cath. Our main source for the life and work of
               Ḥenanishoʿ is the report of the synod that he convened in 775/6, which is included,
               as the last synod, in the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. From this report
               it appears that after the death of Cath. Yaʿqob  II (772/3), Isḥaq bp. of Kashkar,
               who was supported by Caliph al-Mahdī, had been designated to become the next Cath., a
               procedure that was rejected by several other bishops who proposed instead Ḥenanishoʿ,
               until then bp. of Lashom. Ḥenanishoʿ was subsequently consecrated without the
               knowledge and approval of the bp. of Kashkar, even though the latter, since the first
               synod of the Ch. of E. (410), was regarded as the right hand of the Cath. and played
               a crucial role in the process of election and consecration of a new Cath. It was only
               after Isḥaq’s death, shortly after, that reconciliation could be brought about
               between the opposing parties and that Ḥenanishoʿ’s situation could be regularized.
               According to the preserved report, the synod of 775/6 entirely focused on the
               conflict, validating Ḥenanishoʿ’s election and reaffirming the traditional rights of
               the see of Kashkar. Henceforth Ḥenanishoʿ was able to serve as Cath., but only 4
               years later he was killed through poisoning. No other events of Ḥenanishoʿ’s life are
               known, nor have any of his writings, among which <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha
               </ref>mentions letters and <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, been preserved. Ḥenanishoʿ’s
               name is mentioned on the Chinese-Syriac monument of <ref rend="bold">Xi’an</ref>
               (Sian-fu), even though the monument is dated to February 781, which is several months
               after his death.</p>

               vol. III.1, 261 [chapter 178]) wanted to identify with the anonymous ‘Questions on

               Syr. 150, f. 107r–175r (the identification of the author as Ḥenanishoʿ in the margin
               of f. 107r is probably from Assemani’s hand). While Van den Eynde suggested that we
               might be dealing in ms. Vat. Syr. 150 with extracts from Ḥenanishoʿ’s work, Reinink
               found evidence that the ‘Questions on the Economy’ belong to a much later period
               (12th cent. or later), whereby the possibility of Ḥenanishoʿ’s authorship would be
               completely ruled out. Ḥenanishoʿ’s exegetical work must, therefore, be considered
               lost.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>. Hiba must have been active in the <ref rend="bold">School of Edessa</ref> from the second or third decade of the 5th cent. Both the
               E.- and W.-Syr. traditions see him as one of the driving forces behind the
               translation of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>’s works from Greek into
               Syriac, which was carried out at the School and may have begun during Theodore’s
               lifetime (d. 428).</p>
                    <p>Around the time of the Nestorian controversy (428–31), Hiba parted ways with bp. <ref rend="bold">Rabbula of Edessa</ref>. The latter became a staunch defender of <ref rend="bold">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, the main authority for the Syr. Miaphysites,
               while Hiba represented the Antiochene dyophysite tradition. In 433 Hiba wrote a
               famous letter to a certain Mari, ‘the Persian’, in which he bitterly complained about
               Rabbula’s actions against the writings of Theodore, who increasingly was seen as the
               teacher of <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref>. In the mid–430s Edessa must have been
               evenly divided between Miaphysites (followers of Cyril) and Dyophysites (standing in
               Theodore’s tradition), for after Rabbula’s death (436), Hiba was elected as the
               latter’s successor. Even though the campaign against Theodore continued in
               Constantinople, Syria, and Armenia, the situation in Edessa under Hiba’s tenure was
               relatively quiet. As bp., Hiba is credited with building activities. In 448, however,
               Hiba became one of the main targets of the strict Miaphysites, who in the synod of
               Ephesus in 449 (later known as the ‘Robber Synod’) succeeded in deposing him, mainly
               on the grounds of making too strict a distinction between the divinity and humanity
               in Christ. Two years later, Hiba’s letter to Mari was officially read at the Council
               of Chalcedon (451), and Hiba was rehabilitated as bp. of Edessa, a position he was
               able to hold until his death.</p>
                    <p>Nearly a century after his death, Hiba’s name returned to the center of the
               Christological discussions. In an attempt to win Miaphysite acceptance of the Council
               of Chalcedon, the emperor Justinian in an edict of 543/4 condemned Hiba’s letter to
               Mari. Since the letter was seen as sympathetic to Theodore and Nestorius, it was
               considered a stumbling block for the anti-Chalcedonians. Justinian’s condemnation of
               Hiba’s Letter, as one of the ‘Three Chapters’, subsequently was taken over and
               affirmed by the Council of Constantinople (553). This did not, however, lead to the
               reconciliation between Chalcedonians and Miaphysites.</p>
                    <p>Except for Hiba’s letter to Mari, which exists in Greek (in all likelihood translated
               from the Syriac original), no other works by Hiba have been preserved.</p>

               of a local Arab principality, which became a vassal of Rome in 64 BC. Ḥimṣ rose to
               political prominence in the 3rd cent. when Julia Domna, a daughter of the Emesan
               princely-priestly family, married Emperor Septimius Severus (193–211) and two sons of
               the same family, Elagabalus (218–22) and Alexander Severus (222–35), ascended the
               imperial throne. Ḥimṣ fell to the Arabs in 637. In the latter part of the 10th cent.,
               Ḥimṣ was occupied on several occasions by the Byzantines. Ḥimṣ was attacked, but not
               taken, by the Crusaders in 1098 and 1126. Under Ottoman rule (1516–1918), Ḥimṣ was
               the administrative center of a district within the province of <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>. Ḥimṣ is today a provincial capital with a population of just
               under 1 million, making it the third largest city in Syria after <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> and Damascus.</p>
                    <p>Ḥimṣ, the birthplace of Pope Anicetus (ca. 154–66), was no doubt evangelised at an
               early date. The Passion of the local martyr Julian (Elian) has two of its inhabitants
               healed by Jesus and has the apostles Peter and John pass through Ḥimṣ on their way to
                  <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, while the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael
                  Rabo</ref> has Malyo, one of the seventy, preach the Gospel in Ḥimṣ. Historically
               more certain is bp. Silvanus, who was martyred under Diocletian. Among his successors
               in the 4th cent. were <ref rend="bold">Eusebius of Emesa</ref> and Nemesius, the author
               of the treatise ‘On the nature of man’. Ḥimṣ, originally suffragan to Damascus,
               became a metropolitan see after the head of St. John the Baptist was discovered in
               the nearby Monastery of Spelaeon in 452. <ref rend="bold">Romanos the Melodist</ref>
               was a native of Ḥimṣ. Bp. Julian of Ḥimṣ was among the Miaphysite bishops banished
               with <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> in 519. A noteworthy Syr. Orth. scholar
               from Ḥimṣ is ʿAbd al-Masīḥ b. Nāʿima al-Ḥimṣī (fl. ca. 830), who translated the
               so-called ‘Theology of Aristotle’ into Arabic. In later times, together with <ref rend="bold">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>some 70 km. to the south, the area around
               Ḥimṣ remained a center of Syr. Orth. activities, which gained in importance
               especially around the time of <ref rend="bold">Dawid Puniqoyo</ref> (i.e. Dawid of
               Ḥimṣ) and <ref rend="bold">Nuḥ the Lebanese</ref> (Patr. 1493–1509), who was bp. of
               Ḥimṣ in 1480–90 and who spent the latter part of his patriarchate (1493–1509) in the
               area of Ḥimṣ and Ḥama, consecrating the myron once in the Monastery of al-Zunnār in
               Ḥimṣ and once in the Church of the Forty Martyrs there. Ḥimṣ became the seat of the
               Syr. Orth. patriarchate again when Severos <ref rend="bold">Afram Barsoum</ref>, metr.
               of Syria and resident in Ḥimṣ, was elected Patr. in 1933 and remained so until 1959
               when the patriarchate was transferred to Damascus.</p>
                    <p>At the beginning of the 20th cent., Ḥimṣ is reported to have had a population of
               around 50,000, including 33,000 Muslims, 14,500 Melk. Orth., 1,000 Syr. Orth., 500
               Melk. Catholics, and 350 Maron. Ḥimṣ is today the seat of four bishoprics: Syr. Orth.
               (united with Ḥama, with ca. 50,000 faithful), Syr. Catholic (united with Ḥama and
               Nabk, ca. 10,000), Melk. Orth. and Melk. Catholic (united with Ḥama and Yabrud). The
               Syr. Orth. cathedral of St. Mary (Umm al-Zunnār) in the eastern part of the old city
               houses the girdle (<hi rend="italic">zunoro</hi>) of Our Lady which was rediscovered
               under the altar of the church by Patr. Ignatius Aphram Barsoum in 1953.</p>
                    <p>In the environs of Ḥimṣ are two other old centers of W.-Syr. Christianity: Ṣadad (ca.
               50 km. south-southeast of Ḥimṣ), whose bishops are attested sporadically from the
               11th cent. onwards and which was the birthplace of Syr. Orth. Patr. Ignatius <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdullāh Saṭṭūf</ref> (1906–15); and Qaryatayn (75 km. southeast), with
               the Monastery of St. Julian/Mar Elian (now Syr. Cath.) just to the west of the
               village. Several other villages in the area also have (or had) Syr. populations:
               Zaydal (5 km. east of center of Ḥimṣ), Fayrūza (5 km. southeast), Maskana (7 km.
               south; birthplace of Syr. Catholic Patr. Ignatius Mūsā Dāʾūd, Patr. 1998–2001),
               al-Fuḥīla (20 km. southeast), Furqlus (35 km. east-southeast) and al-Ḥafar (7  km.
               south of Ṣadad).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Ḥimyar is the name of a geographical area in southwest Arabia as well as that of a
               tribal confederation in power from the 1st cent. BC to ca. AD 525. At times the
               Ḥimyarites ruled over large parts of S. Arabia, well into the Arabian desert. Their
               capital was Ẓafār, near present-day Yarīm (in Yemen). Inscriptions in Sabaic, an Old
               South Arabian language, were produced until the 6th cent. AD. Living from trade, the
               Ḥimyarites had to assert their power vis-à-vis the Ethiopians in the Horn of Africa,
               and vis-à-vis the Romans in the north. In the 4th cent. they came into contact with
               both Christianity and Judaism.</p>
                    <p>The Ḥimyarites are occasionally mentioned in Syriac literature. In the Life of Bishop
               Paul of Qentos and Priest John of Edessa (which details events from the first half of
               the 5th cent.) it is reported that Paul and John, on their way from <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> to Mount Sinai, are captured by pagan, tree-worshipping Arabs and
               brought to a place named ‘of the Ḥimyarites’. The Ḥimyarites occupy a more prominent
               place in the literature concerning the war that broke out in the 2nd decade of the
               6th cent. and culminated in the persecution and killing of Christians by the king of
               the Ḥimyarites in the city of <ref rend="bold">Nagran</ref>. The date of the
               persecution is debated, either 518 or 523. The existence of a letter written by <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> to the persecuted Nagranites would point to the
               former date, while the majority of the other sources explicitly refer to the latter.
               The sources present the king of Ḥimyar, variously known as Yūsuf, Masrūq, or
               Dhū-Nuwās, as being Jewish, which adds to the dramatic power of the narratives. The
               persecution in Nagran was the prelude to a major intervention by the joint forces of
               the Roman emperor Justin I and the Ethiopian negus, which ended Ḥimyarite supremacy
               on the Arabian Peninsula and established an Ethiopian protectorate, which also had
               close contacts with the Byzantine Empire. The Persians conquered S. Arabia in 572,
               and this region came under Muslim rule in 628.</p>
                    <p>One of the main sources providing information on the persecution and the martyrdom of
               Christians in Nagran is the Syriac ‘Book of the Ḥimyarites’ (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā
                  da-ḥmirāye</hi>), which is only fragmentarily known in a 10th-cent. ms. (ed. A.
               Moberg). The Book is anonymous, but I. Shahîd argued that its author was <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun of Beth Arsham</ref>, a well-known anti-Chalcedonian leader, who
               authored one and possibly two Syriac letters concerning the persecution. Not only the
               Book’s authorship, but also its relationship to the other sources is debated. The
               persecuted Christians of Nagran are portrayed in the Syriac sources as being of
               non-Chalcedonian allegiance. The Greek version of the ‘Martyrdom of Arethas’
               (Ḥārith), however, a text that does not exist in Syriac, is written from a
               Chalcedonian viewpoint. The Greek texts concerning Gregentius bp. of Ẓafār, who lived
               in the 6th cent., reflect a Chalcedonian milieu as well.</p>

                    <p>Ancient city near the Euphrates to the southeast of present-day al-Najaf. Ḥirta was
               the capital of the pre-Islamic Arab kingdom of the Lakhmids, who were usually allied
               with the Sasanians and constantly at war with the Ghassānids, allies of Byzantium, to
               the west. It was an important center of pre-Islamic Arab culture, where many of its
               poets gathered and where the Arabic script is said to have originated. The name
               ‘Ḥirtā’ is indicative of its origin as a nomadic encampment, and in Syriac sources it
               is sometimes called ‘Ḥirtā d-Nuʿmān’ to distinguish it from other such settlements.
               ʿAmr b. ʿAdī (ca. 270–300) is said to have been the first Lakhmid to make Ḥirta his
               capital. By the 5th cent., the population under Lakhmid rule had a large Christian
               component, called the ʿIbād, which is understood to mean ‘servants’ or ‘devotees’ of
               the Lord. The Syriac Life of <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref> tells us that
               Nuʿmān I (405–18) revoked the prohibition on his subjects travelling into Roman
               territory on pilgrimage to Shemʿun’s pillar after a visit from the stylite in a
               dream. Nuʿmān II (500–3), though not a baptised Christian, is said to have regularly
               attended church services. Mundhir III (506–54), who had a Christian mother (Māʾ
               al-Samāʾ) and a Christian wife (Hind, daughter of Arethas/Ḥārith b. ʿAmr al-Kindī),
               may have become Christian himself for a brief period before reverting to paganism.
               The only Lakhmid king to become openly Christian and persist in his faith was Nuʿmān
               III (583 – ca. 602), the last of the dynasty, who was deposed and killed by the
               Sasanian king Khusrau II (590–628). Ḥirta was taken by the Muslim army under Khālid
               b. al-Walīd in 633. Ḥirta began to decline when the new garrison town of al-Kūfa was
               founded near ʿĀqolā a few kilometers north of Ḥirta by Saʿd b. Abī Waqqāṣ in 638, to
               become the administrative center of al-ʿIrāq under Arab occupation and, for a time
               under the first Abbasids (750–63), the seat of the caliphate.</p>
                    <p>The first known bp. of Ḥirta is Hoshaʿ, who attended the synod of the Ch. of E. in
               410. The Ch. of E. Catholicoi frequently resided in Ḥirta, especially at times of
               persecution in areas under direct Sasanian rule, and at least five of them found
               their resting places in Ḥirta (<ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ I</ref> [421–56], Babowai
               [457–84], <ref rend="bold">Aba  I</ref> [540–52], Ḥazqiel [567–81], and <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb I</ref> [582–95]; perhaps also <ref rend="bold">Aqaq</ref> [485–95/6]
               and, later, Abraham II [837–50]). There was a school at Ḥirta founded by <ref rend="bold">Qiyore of Edessa</ref>, a disciple of Aba I, and housed in a monastery
               later called Dayr al-Askūl. Among the later bishops of Ḥirta was the lexicographer
                  <ref rend="bold">Ḥenanishoʿ b. Seroshway</ref> (9th cent.). The famous translator
                  <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> al-ʿIbādī (d. 873) was a native of Ḥirta. The
               last known bp. of Ḥirta is Yūḥannā b. Nāzūk, who became Cath. in 1012.</p>
                    <p>We hear of two attempts made to win the Lakhmids to Miaphysitism at the beginning of
               the 6th cent., through a letter purportedly sent by <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of
                  Mabbug</ref> to Abū Yaʿfur (503–5) and through emissaries sent by <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> to Mundhir III in 513. A little later the Miaphysite
               missionary-bishop <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun of Beth Arsham</ref> was active in the area
               and reported from here about the events in <ref rend="bold">Nagran</ref> in 524. A
               group of Miaphysites fleeing persecution by Emperor Justin I (518–27) took refuge in
               Ḥirta, but were expelled at the insistence of Cath. Shila (503–23) and resettled in
               the ‘Land of Payram’, around ʿAyn al-Tamr, to the northwest of Ḥirta. Some time
               before 549, the partisans of <ref rend="bold">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref> also sent a
               bp. called Sergios to Ḥirta, who gained a following in the ‘Land of Payram’, which
               was settled by migrants from South Arabian Nagran. This Julianist community in Iraqi
               Nagran survived until the end of the 8th cent., when we hear of their final surrender
               to the Ch. of E. in two letters of <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>. W.-Syr. presence
               near Ḥirta is indicated in the 7th cent. by a reference to <ref rend="bold">Marutha of
                  Tagrit</ref> staying in the cell of Rabban Shabur at ʿĀqolā/ʿOqulo just before
               624, and in the 8th cent. by the mention of bp. Bacchus of ʿOqulo, who became metr.
               of <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref> ca. 706, as well as by <ref rend="bold">Giwargi bp. of
                  the Arab tribes</ref> styling himself as the bp. of the ‘Tanukhoye, Tuʿoye, and
               ʿOquloye’ in his letter to the priest Yeshuʿ of ʿAna.</p>
                    <p>The Lakhmid kings normally resided in palaces outside of Ḥirta, such as the famous
               palace of al-Khawarnaq to the east of Ḥirta. The township of Ḥirta itself was made up
               of a series of fortified dwellings, each of them normally associated with a certain
               clan. Some, at least, of the churches were also associated with specific clans, such
               as those of the Banū Māzin and Banū ʿAdī. Two churches, unfortunately without
               indication of their names, were discovered in excavations carried out at Ḥirta by an
               Oxford expedition led by D. Talbot Rice in 1931. The large number of monasteries that
               dotted the countryside around Ḥirta were described in the <hi rend="italic">Kutub
                  al-diyārāt</hi>, a special genre of Arabic literature dealing with monasteries,
               such as Shābushtī’s (d. ca. 988) ‘Book of monasteries’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb
                  al-diyārāt</hi>) and Hishām b. Muḥammad al-Kalbī’s (d. ca. 819) ‘Book of Ḥīra’
                  (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-Ḥīra</hi>), which is now lost but was used, among
               others, by the geographer Yāqūt in his <hi rend="italic">Muʿjam al-buldān</hi>. In
               these works, many of the monasteries around Ḥirta are associated with and named after
               (often female) members of the Lakhmid royal family, including al-Lajj, a daughter of
               Nuʿmān II, ʿAlqama, the father of Abū Yaʿfur (503–5), Ḥanẓala, a nephew of the same,
               Hind the Elder, the wife of Mundhir III, and Hind the Younger, a daughter of Nuʿmān
               III.</p>

                    <p>The beginnings of writing history in Syriac remain unknown, but one may connect it to
               the existence of notes on various events that were kept in the royal archives of
               Osrhoene (although there must have been similar archives in other <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref>-speaking countries, e.g. in <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref>, we have
               no information about them). The notes per se are not historiography, but they could
               be used to construct a narrative of some kind about the past. After the end of the
               kingdom of Osrhoene, the materials from the royal archives, at least partly, found
               their way to the episcopal archives. This can be inferred from the first W.-Syr.
               local chronicle that we know, the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Edessa</ref>, written
               soon after 532 in which local material from both the pre-Christian epoch (such as the
               chronologically first note: ‘The year 180 [of the Seleucid era  = 132/1 BC]: kings
               began to reign in Edessa.’) and Christian epoch was included.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Chronicle Writing</label>
                    <p>The Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> opens the series of local chronicles
               (which occasionally also have notes on non-local events, e.g. on the birth of Jesus
               or the accession of Roman emperors). A comparison of this Chronicle with other
               chronicles of similar character has revealed that it is an excerpt from a more
               extensive, not extant, work conventionally called the Original Chronicle of Edessa.
               Some of the notes (lemmata) of the latter that are not present in the extant
               Chronicle of Edessa can be found in other Syriac chronicles, e.g. the Chronicle to
               the year 819. In its first part it seems to have followed quite closely the Original
               Chronicle of Edessa, but in the second part it notes other events: a series of
               lemmata recount events connected with the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Mor
                  Gabriel</ref>, from which it may be inferred that its author was a monk of that
               monastery.</p>
                    <p>What the local chronicles also have in common is their annalistic structure, which
               means that they present historical events in short pieces of information, called
               lemmata. These begin with a year date and state what happened that year. A typical
               such lemma is for instance ‘The year 672: Walgash, bishop of Nisibis, died...’.</p>
                    <p>There were certainly other chronicles of this type, which however have not survived.
               We have several fragments of such works, sometimes only a few folios long, but still
               valuable for the historical information they provide, as for instance one very
               mutilated folio that brings information on the Arab conquest of Syria in the
               beginning of the 7th cent., or a fragment of a Chronicle up to the year 813 (<hi rend="italic">Chronica minora</hi>, II &amp; III).</p>
                    <p>In addition to historical information of local character soon another type of
               historiographic literature developed, the so-called universal (or world) chronicles.
               This genre was implanted in Syriac by translation of two chronicles written in Greek,
               those of <ref rend="bold">Hippolytus of Rome</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Eusebius of
                  Caesarea</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The first of them seems to have been intended not as a continuous exposition of the
               events of world history, but rather as a gazetteer providing geographical,
               ethnographical, and linguistic information on the then known world, in addition to
               data on the early history of mankind, culled from the Bible. The Chronicle of
               Hippolytus of Rome (d. 235), or rather its material (as it had a complicated
               transmission history) is also known as the Division of the earth (<hi rend="italic">Diamerismos tēs gēs</hi>), i.e. between the sons of Noah, since geographical
               lists (of countries, mountains, rivers, islands), ethnographical (of various
               peoples), linguistic (of languages including those that have written literature), and
               historical were all expressed within the account of the vicissitudes of the three
               sons of Noah and their progeny. They were believed to have divided the world into
               their respective possessions. In Syriac several versions of Hippolytos’s material are
               known, sometimes only fragmentarily preserved, either as separate texts (Peoples
               after the confusion of languages in Babylon, On the families of languages), or  —
               more often — incorporated into larger works, be it chronicles (the Chronicle to the
               year 724, the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, and that of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʾEbroyo</ref> [see below]), or other texts, such as biblical
               commentaries (Scholion of <ref rend="bold">Theodoros Bar Koni</ref>, the Commentary of
                  <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, and two other anonymous commentaries, all
               from the period of the 8th to 10th cent.), and accounts of sacred history (<ref rend="bold">Shlemon of Baṣra</ref>’s ‘Book of the Bee’, 13th cent.) (Witakowski
               1996).</p>
                    <p>The Chronicle of Eusebius of Caesarea (d. 339) had a very specific form, called
               canons: it was written in the form of tables with parallel columns in which the years
               of the rulers of all nations or states known to him were enumerated (the so-called
                  <hi rend="italic">fila regnorum</hi>), whereas on both sides of these columns, the
               so-called <hi rend="italic">spatium historicum</hi>, notes on various events were
               placed (Witakowski 1999–2000). The Chronicle was translated into Syriac in the 6th
               cent. It has not been preserved, but it was used by many later Syr. chroniclers,
               thanks to whom we know relatively well how it was structured and what it contained.
               The work of Eusebius was expanded by later Greek chroniclers (Annianos [5th cent.]
               and Andronikos [6th cent.]), who added material from the creation of the world
               (Eusebius started his canons from Abraham) and continued its narrative up to their
               time. These chronicles were translated into Syriac too, but none of them is
               extant.</p>
                    <p>The earliest Syr. chronicle which used Eusebius’s work as its source is the so-called
               Maronite Chronicle, written after 664. Its author supplemented the Eusebian material
               with material from other sources and notes on the history of the Maronites. He
               continued it until his own epoch, adding notes on the history of the Arabs. The
               Maronite Chronicle does not have the column form.</p>
                    <p>Even earlier than the work just named is the Melkite Chronicle, composed after 638,
               which, however, did not use the Chronicle of Eusebius. It brings Old Testament
               chronology, and for the Christian period, lists of patriarchs of the main sees,
               becoming more informative only from the epoch of <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref>. Its
               Melkite origin is clear from the presence of anti-Miaphysite anathemas (ed. de
               Halleux).</p>
                    <p>The Eusebian model is on the other hand clearly seen in the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (d. 708). This work, only fragmentarily
               preserved, has the column format of Eusebius. Yaʿqub did not copy Eusebius’s work,
               only continued it. He provided material on the history of the Church, of the
               Byzantine empire, and of Persia, a country which Eusebius totally neglected, but
               which the Syr. historians for obvious reasons could not (Witakowski 2008).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Ecclesiastical History Writing</label>
                    <p>Eusebius’s influence in Syr. historiography is seen not only in chronography, but
               also in another genre of history writing, namely ecclesiastical (or church) history
               (Syr. <hi rend="italic">eqlisiyasṭiqi</hi>). Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History was
               very soon, in any case before the middle of the 5th cent., translated into Syriac
               (Van Rompay 1994), and contrary to the Chronicle it has been preserved, though with
               lacunae. It was used by later Syr. historians, whereby the genre of ecclesiastical
               history was implanted in Syriac historiography.</p>
                    <p>Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History found continuators in Greek too, and the work of at
               least one of them, Socrates Scholasticus (d. ca. 450), was translated into Syriac,
               and has been preserved both in excerpts and in an abbreviated form (not published).
               Whether works of other continuators of Eusebius, Sozomen, and <ref rend="bold">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref> were also translated into Syriac, but have not been
               preserved, is not certain. On the other hand, at least two fragments of the latter’s
               ‘Religious History’ were translated into Syriac: the lives of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub
                  of Nisibis</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>. What is extant in
               Syriac is a translation of another Ecclesiastical History, namely that of <ref rend="bold">Zacharias Rhetor</ref>, bp. of Mitylene (d. after 536), which is even
               more valuable as the Greek original is lost. Zacharias was a Miaphysite, which is why
               copying his works in Greek was discontinued, whereas they have survived in Syriac
               translations. The Syriac version of his Ecclesiastical History was incorporated into
               a larger compilation supplied with hagiographical and other material and continued
               until the year 569, by an anonymous historian who for lack of a better name is
               referred to as <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>.</p>
                    <p>A church historian a few years younger than Zacharias was <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of
                  Ephesus</ref> (d. 588), a monk from Northern Mesopotamia, who spent most of his
               life in Constantinople. Only the last, the third, part of his Ecclesiastical History
               has survived in a separate ms. tradition. We owe to Yuḥanon also another work, the
               ‘Lives of the Eastern Saints’, which is a collection of lives of Syr. ascetics, most
               of whom Yuḥanon knew personally.</p>
                    <p>As far as the state of preservation is concerned the Ecclesiastical History of Patr.
                  <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> (818–845) fared even worse.
               Fortunately it was used by later Syriac historians, especially by Michael Rabo and
               the author of the Chronicle to the year 1234.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Later W.-Syr. Historiography</label>
                    <p>A work once erroneously attributed to Patr. Dionysios is a universal Chronicle whose
               anonymous author was a monk in the monastery of Zuqnin near <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>
               (8th  cent.). The Chronicle, composed in 775, was previously called the Chronicle of
               Pseudo-Dionysios, but is now mostly referred to as the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of
                  Zuqnin</ref>. Although the author used Eusebian material, his work, especially in
               later parts, does not present information in short lemmata, but has extensive
               excerpts from other kinds of sources. In fact it is the largest Syr.
               historiographical work written until the 8th cent., introducing a new genre:
               developed chronicle. The annalistic structure is kept (though there are no canons)
               but the author often inserted material from his sources in large extracts or in their
               entirety. His main sources are the Bible, the Chronicle of Eusebius, the
               Ecclesiastical History of Socrates, and that of Yuḥanon of Ephesus, while the last
               part contains his own material. He used many other sources, including works which
               have been subsequently lost (Witakowski 1987). One of such works, most probably
               copied by him in its entirety, is the Chronicle of Pseudo-<ref rend="bold">Yeshuʿ the
                  Stylite</ref>, a history of the Persian-Byzantine war of the beginning of the 6th
               cent., written practically as an eye-witness account.</p>
                    <p>With this first developed chronicle in Syriac, the genre difference between chronicle
               and ecclesiastical history was abolished.</p>
                    <p>It does not mean however that short chronicles were no longer composed. The material
               published under the title of the Chronicle to the year 724 (anonymous, but see Palmer
               1992) is actually not a chronicle in the meaning of a planned and elaborate
               historiographic work, but a collection of series of lemmata culled from various
               sources, including the Chronicle of Hippolytus, the Chronicle of Eusebius, together
               with its Antiochene Continuation (Burgess 1999), an account of Church councils, and a
               list of Umayyad caliphs, put down one after another without the chronological order.
               In fact for many lemmata dates are missing.</p>
                    <p>The Chronicle to the year 846 is again a short lemma chronicle. Although the
               preserved text starts from the birth of Levi, the son of the Old Testament patriarch
               Jacob (there are many lacunae further on in the text too), there can be no doubt that
               it was a universal chronicle. It includes material taken from several sources, such
               as the Chronicle of Eusebius for universal history, and  — for local data — the
               Original Chronicle of Edessa, the Chronicle to the year 819, the <ref rend="bold">Teaching of Addai</ref>, the Ecclesiastical Histories of Yuḥanon of Ephesus and
               Zacharias of Mitylene, lists of bishops of various sees, and accounts of church
               councils.</p>
                    <p>Later chronicles, written during the period of the so-called <ref rend="bold">Syriac
                  Renaissance</ref>, are all of the developed type. These are the Chronicle of
               Michael Rabo (d. 1199), the anonymous <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of 1234</ref>, and the
               Chronicle of Bar ʿEbroyo (d. 1286). From the indications of the sources that the
               authors of these works have made (e.g. the Chronicles by Basil of Edessa, <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>, etc.) we know that there was much more
               historiographical literature composed before the epoch of Michael Rabo, but none of
               them is extant. (For the latter Chronicle, see the entry on Michael Rabo.)</p>
                    <p>The author of the anonymous Chronicle of 1234, was probably a monk of the <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref>, and seems to have had some more or less
               official auxiliary ecclesiastical duties. He was a native of Edessa, which can be
               seen in his detailed notes on the events of the history of that city. Most of them,
               it is true, were taken from the lost Edessene chronicle of Basil Bar Shumana, the
               metropolitan of Edessa, but they continue even after the date of the latter’s death
               (1171). The Chronicle was begun as a simple work of universal history, but after the
               epoch of Constantine the abundance of material to be dealt with caused the author to
               divide it into two parts, ecclesiastical and secular. The Edessene author used many
               of the sources that Michael Rabo did, but independently from him: he did not know
               Michael’s work.</p>
                    <p>Dividing historiographical works into two parts became a solution also with Bar
               ʿEbroyo. With his Chronicle the classical period of W.-Syr. historiography ends. (For
               further information on his work, see the entry on this author.)</p>
                    <label type="subsection">E.-Syr. Historiography</label>
                    <p>The output of the E.-Syr. historians seems smaller today than that of their W.-Syr.
               colleagues, but this impression is due to the fact that even fewer E.-Syr.
               historiographic works have been preserved than was the case with the W.-Syr. We do
               know, however, from <ref rend="bold">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (see below) and from <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ Bar Brikha</ref>, the author of the so-called ‘Catalogue’
               (13th cent.), that there were once many more historiographic works than are extant
               today in the known collections of mss.</p>
                    <p>One such work of which ʿAbdishoʿ informs us was an Ecclesiastical History composed by
               one Mshiḥa Zkha. When a ms. containing an account of early Christian history in
               Adiabene was discovered and published in 1907, it seemed to its finder and editor (A.
               Mingana) that it was Mshiḥa Zkha’s work. This identification may not be correct, and
               in fact today it is referred to as an anonymous Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref>. It is a collection of biographies of 20 bps. of this see, from the
               early 2nd cent. up to the middle of the 6th cent., when it was probably composed. The
               authenticity of the Chronicle of Arbela was questioned (because of forgery of the
               only known ms. of the Chronicle; Fiey 1967), but the opinion of most scholars today
               is rather in favor of the authenticity of at least large parts of the material of the
               Chronicle (Kawerau 1985).</p>
                    <p>The Ecclesiastical History of <ref rend="bold">Barḥadbshabba ʿArbaya</ref> (6th cent.)
               is the oldest (preserved) E.-Syr. work of this genre. Barḥadbshabba, who was a senior
               scholar (Syr. <hi rend="italic">bādoqā</hi>) of the famous theological <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref>, provides a series of accounts of Church Fathers and
               ‘heretics’, starting from Arius and coming up to <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Abraham</ref>, the doctors of the Persian Church (6th  cent.), attached
               to the School. Much place is naturally devoted to <ref rend="bold">Diodore of
                  Tarsus</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref>, but <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Basil
                  of Caesarea</ref>, and other fathers have their place here too. Among the sources
               of Barḥadbshabba are the Ecclesiastical History of Socrates for the Greek fathers and
               Nestorius’s Book of Heraclides.</p>
                    <p>The anonymous History of <ref rend="bold">Karka d-Beth Slokh</ref> (6th  cent.), except
               for a few details regarding the history of the city, is an account of the martyrdom
               of several inhabitants of that city who were killed during the persecutions of
               Yazdgard in the middle of the 5th cent.</p>
                    <p>The Chronicle of Khuzistan, also known as the Chronicle of the last Sasanians (7th
               cent.), provides information on the history of the Persian Church, and moreover, it
               contains much valuable data for the history of Persia from the reign of Hormizd IV
               (579–90) until the Arab conquest. The Chronicle seems to be an excerpt from a larger
               (not preserved) work on ecclesiastical history, the author of which was, according to
               some scholars, Eliya metropolitan of Merv.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan bar Penkaye</ref>, i.e. from the village Penek in Northern
               Mesopotamia, wrote soon after 686 the ‘Book of the Main Events’ (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-reš melle</hi>), which is an epitome of world history, intended as an
               account of God’s salvation economy. Still it is a valuable source for the last
               decades it covers (the reign of Caliph Muʿāwiyya and beyond).</p>
                    <p>The E.-Syr. authors were perhaps more interested in monastic history than the W.-Syr.
               historians. One work of this type is the ‘Book of the Abbots of the <ref rend="bold">Monastery Beth ʿAbe</ref>’, composed ca. 850 by <ref rend="bold">Toma bp. of
                  Marga</ref> in Adiabene.</p>
                    <p>One or two decades later another monastic history, entitled ‘The Book of Chastity’,
               was composed by <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref> the metropolitan of Baṣra. It contains
               140 biographical sketches of E.-Syr. monastics, famous as founders of monasteries or
               as authors of ascetic writings. The same author is also known to have composed a
               separate Ecclesiastical History, which has not survived.</p>
                    <p>The Chronicle of Eliya of Nisibis (d. 1046) is the only E.-Syr. universal chronicle
               of the Eusebian type. In the first, so-called chronographical, part Eliya, following
               Eusebius, gathered lists of Old Testament patriarchs, kings, and rulers of various
               countries, together with an annotated list of the catholicoi of the Ch. of E. The
               next part, the canons, is written in columns, but Eliya uses them in a different way
               from Eusebius. From right to left they contain: 1. dates given in the Seleucid era,
               and, for the Muslim period, in the era of Hijra; 2. the source of the entry (it is
               here that we learn of many Syr. historiographic works that once existed), which as a
               regularly recurring piece of information is exceptional in Syr. chronicle writing;
               and 3. the actual lemmata given in two languages, Syriac and Arabic (an indication
               that the Arabization of the E. Syrians had already made some progress). Eliya’s
               sources include Eusebius’s Chronicle, Socrates’s Ecclesiastical History, and W.-Syr.
               works: the Chronicle of Yuḥanon ‘the Jacobite’, i.e. Yuḥanon of Ephesus, Chronicle of
               Yaʿqub of Edessa, and a list of the Syr. Orth. patriarchs. This shows exchange
               between the intellectuals of the two Syr.-speaking churches. Among the E.-Syr.
               sources he quotes a list of the catholicoi and a chronicle of the metropolitans of
                  <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, but also Arabic sources. Altogether he quotes ca. 60
               sources of which half are unknown (Pinggéra 2006; Witakowski 2007).</p>
                    <p>From the last period of the classical epoch of Syr. literature comes the biography of
               the Cath. <ref rend="bold">Yahbalaha  III</ref> (d. 1317), who before his election was
               a monk in <ref rend="bold">China</ref> of Uighur or Turkish origin. The Story of
               Yabhalaha is a biography of the Cath. but also a travelogue of his journey, together
               with his companion, <ref rend="bold">Rabban Ṣawma</ref>, across Asia, and in its second
               part Ṣawma’s across Europe. As such it is unique in Syriac literature. It provides an
               insight into the contacts between geographically remote provinces and the center of
               the once pan-Asiatic Ch. of E. before its decline in the subsequent epoch.</p>
                    <p>E.-Syr. authors wrote also historiographic works in Arabic. The change of the
               language occurred gradually, the first step being taken by Eliya of Nisibis who used
               both languages in the same work. There is no doubt, however, that works such as the
               Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref>(10th cent.) or The Book of the Tower (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-Majdāl</hi>; ca. 1350), although written in Arabic, were
               based on Syriac sources.</p>

                    <p>The Chaldean monastery of Rabban Hormizd, built upon a mountain ridge northeast of
                  <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref>in northern Iraq, is famous not only for its
               magnificent location and impressive buildings, but also for its central role in the
               history of the transmission of E.-Syr. literature and its importance in the struggles
               between the Chald. Church and the Ch. of E., to which the monastery originally
               belonged. Similar struggles, between the Syr. Orth. and the Ch. of E., formed the
               context of the monastery’s early beginnings in the 7th cent., when, according to
               Rabban Shemʿon, the author of the ‘History of Rabban Hormizd the Persian’, it was
               founded by Rabban Hormizd of <ref rend="bold">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>, a former monk of the
               Monastery of Rabban <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEdta</ref>. Whereas a few 12th-cent. mss.
               indicate its importance in earlier centuries, the monastery’s most important
               achievements date from the late 15th to early 20th cent. Following the turbulent 14th
               cent., its monks contributed to the revival of E.-Syr. ms. writing in the 15th and
               first half of the 16th cent. Among the earliest authors of that period is the monk
                  <ref rend="bold">Sargis bar Waḥle</ref>(ca. 1500), who wrote a <hi rend="italic">Memronā</hi> (a metrical homily) on Rabban Hormizd. In the 17th and early 18th
               cent., after the number of monks declined considerably, a few clerical families from
               nearby Alqosh took the lead in ms. production. Among these was the Abuna family, who
               also provided the patriarchs for one of the patriarchal lines of the Ch. of E. These
               patriarchs of the Eliya line had their official residence in the monastery, where
               most of them were also buried, their grave stones spanning the centuries between 1497
               and 1804. In Rabban Hormizd, also the first schism with the Chaldean church
               originated, when in 1552 its abbot <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref> was elected
               as a counter-patriarch after part of the Ch. of E. disagreed with the choice of a new
               potential successor (<hi rend="italic">naṭar kursi</hi>) from the Abuna family.
               Despite Sullaqa’s relative success in acquiring papal consecration and establishing a
               new Catholic line, the monastery remained in the hands of the traditional party and
               was a seat of opposition to the Catholic hierarchies until the late 18th cent., even
               though some of the Eliya patriarchs attempted to establish their own connections with
               Rome. After the monastery was practically deserted in the late 18th cent., a new era
               started when the Chaldean monk Gabriel Dambo (alternatively written as Danbo)
               appropriated it as the location of a new monastic community. After initial
               opposition, his order was recognized in 1830, by which time the patr. of the Eliya
               line, Yoḥannan Hormizd, had also converted to Catholicism. Gabriel Dambo succeeded in
               attracting a group of enthusiastic monks, who after some training were sent into the
               villages of northern Iraq to assist the Dominican missionaries in their work in the
               countryside. Some of the monks later became bishops, while ms. writing was taken up
               again as well. One of the more serious problems of the monastery was its isolated
               location making it vulnerable to pillage and raids by local Kurds and passing armies;
               documented attacks include Murād Bey’s attack in 1508, Kurdish threats in 1706 and
               1717, pillaging by the Persian armies of Nādir Shāh in 1743, and again Kurdish raids
               in 1842 and 1850. In 1858, therefore, the decision was made to build a new Chaldean
               monastery, ‘Our Lady of the Seeds’ (‘Notre Dame des Semences’), closer to Alqosh,
               safer and more comfortable in the cold winter months. It was here that the scribal
               tradition of Rabban Hormizd was again taken up and carried into the early 20th
               cent.</p>

               Baskintā. In 1893 he joined the monastery of Mar Mūsā al-Dawwār in Metn and became a

               1897–98. He was ordained a priest in 1898, and began teaching, especially Syriac, at

                    <p>Physician, philosopher, theologian, and translator. His full name is Abū Zayd Ḥunayn
               b. Isḥāq b. Sulaymān b. Ayyūb al-ʿIbādī, and he was known in medieval Europe as
               Johannitius. He was born in 808 near <ref rend="bold">Ḥirta</ref>, where his father was
               a pharmacist. He likely grew up bilingual in Arabic and Syriac, and he acquired an
               excellent knowledge of Greek as well as Persian in the course of his education.
               Ḥunayn studied medicine in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> under the famous physician
               Yūḥannā b. Māsawayh (d. 857), who stemmed from one of the prominent medical families
               of Gondeshapur (<ref rend="bold">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>). In Baghdad, Ḥunayn became
               well-known as one of the foremost translators of Greek texts into Syriac and Arabic.
               In addition to his translation activity, Ḥunayn was also the personal physician of
               Caliph al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–61). He died in Baghdad in 873.</p>
                    <p>Ḥunayn is best known for the central role that he played in the Graeco-Arabic
               translation movement of the early Abbasid period (in general, see Gutas). His
               translation activity was carried out in conjunction with a number of his students,
               including his son Isḥāq b. Ḥunayn (d. 910), his nephew Ḥubaysh b. al-Ḥasan, ʿĪsā b.
               Yaḥyā, and Isṭifān b. Bāsīl. Ḥunayn and his school translated well over a hundred
               Greek medical works, including Hippocrates, Dioscorides, as well as almost the entire
               corpus of <ref rend="bold">Galen</ref>. In addition to medicine, they translated Greek
               philosophical and scientific texts, including Plato, <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>,
               Proclus, and <ref rend="bold">Porphyry</ref>. A number of fascinating insights into the
               philological method of Ḥunayn and his school can be gleaned from Ḥunayn’s‘Letter to
               ʿAlī b. Yaḥyā on Galen’s books which have been translated …’ (<hi rend="italic">Risāla ilā ʿAlī ibn Yaḥyā fī dhikr mā turjima min kutub Jālīnūs …</hi>; ed. with
               GT in Bergsträsser 1925, 1932; ET Lamoreaux). In this Letter, Ḥunayn reports that he
               travelled throughout Mesopotamia, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt in order to procure
               Greek mss. of works that he wished to translate. He often collated multiple mss. of a
               given work in order to obtain a sound textual basis for his translations. In his
               translations, he seems to have adopted a <hi rend="italic">sensus de sensu
               </hi>approach departing from the literal <hi rend="italic">verbum e verbo
               </hi>approach that characterized 6th- and 7th-cent. Syriac translations from Greek
               (see Brock; see also <ref rend="bold">Greek, Syriac translations from</ref>). In some
               cases, Ḥunayn revised older translations, such as those by <ref rend="bold">Sergios of
                  Reshʿayna</ref> (d. 536) and <ref rend="bold">Iyob of Edessa</ref> (d. ca. 835?). In
               other cases, however, he states that the existing translations were so poor that it
               was necessary for him to begin anew from the Greek. Ḥunayn translated from Greek into
               both Syriac and Arabic (usually via Syriac) depending on the request of his patron.
               In a number of cases, Ḥunayn first translated the Greek into Syriac, and after that
               one of his students translated the Syriac into Arabic, which Ḥunayn then corrected
               against the Greek.</p>
                    <p>In addition to his vast body of translation work, Ḥunayn was an important author in
               his own right. In his <hi rend="italic">ʿUyūn al-ʾanbāʾ fī ṭabaqāt al-ʾaṭibbā</hi>,
               Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa (d. 1270) attributes 111 works to Ḥunayn (ed. A. Müller, <hi rend="italic">Ibn Abi Useibia</hi> [1884], 184–200). Most of Ḥunayn’s works are in
               the field of <ref rend="bold">medicine</ref>, and a majority of these medical works are
               epitomes, paraphrases, or summaries of Greek works. Among Ḥunayn’s best known
               original works in medicine is his ‘Introduction to medicine’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb
                  al-mudkhal fī al-ṭibb</hi>). The substance of this text is also found in
               catechetical form in his ‘Book of medical questions’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb
                  al-masāʾil al-ṭibbiyya</hi>), which also exists in Syriac (see Degen) and which in
               its Latin translation remained authoritative through the Middle Ages. In addition,
               Ḥunayn authored several important works on ocular medicine, including the ‘Ten
               treatises on the eye’ (<hi rend="italic">al-ʿAšr maqālāt fī al-ʿayn</hi>;ed. with ET
               Meyerhof) and the ‘Book of questions on the eye’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-masāʾil
                  fī al-ʿayn</hi>; ed. with FT Sbath and Meyerhof).</p>
                    <p>Ḥunayn is said to have written several works on grammar, including ‘The rules of
               inflexion according to the Greeks’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb fī aḥkām al-iʿrāb ʿalā
                  madhab al-yūnāniyyīn</hi>), ‘Book on syntax’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb fī
                  al-naḥw</hi>), and ‘Book of the diacritical points’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb
                  al-nuqaṭ</hi>). In his ‘Catalogue’, <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (d.
               1318) also attributes a grammar to Ḥunayn (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>,
               vol. 3.1, 165). In addition, Ḥunayn is said to have written several works on Syriac
               lexicography, including the ‘Book of similar words’ (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā da-šmāhe
                  dāmyāye</hi>; ed. Hoffmann, 2–49 along with Gottheil 1887, 61*–67*; 1889), the
               ‘Explanation of Greek words in Syriac’ (<hi rend="italic">Puššāq šmāhe yawnāye
                  b-suryāyā</hi>), and a Compendious Lexicon (<hi rend="italic">Lehksiqāwn</hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">b-pāsiqātā</hi>). These lexicographical works laid the foundation
               for the Syriac-Arabic lexicon of Ḥunayn’s student <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar ʿAli</ref>
               (second half of the 9th  cent.) as well as that of <ref rend="bold">Ḥasan bar Bahlul
               </ref>(mid-10th cent.) (see <ref rend="bold">Lexicography</ref>).</p>
                    <p>Ḥunayn also authored several works of a religious character, of which the following
               have been edited: ‘Treatise on human destiny’ (<hi rend="italic">Maqāla fī
                  al-ājāl</hi>; ed. Samir 1991; see also his study in <hi rend="italic">ARAM</hi>31
               [1991], 171–92), ‘Book on the comprehension of the truth of religions’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb fī idrāk ḥaqīqat al-adyān</hi>; title varies; ed. with FT
               Cheikho; ed. Sbath 1929; ed. Samir 1997), and the related response to ʿAlī b. Yaḥyā
               al-Munajjim (ed. with FT Samir and Nwyia). Unpublished or lost works of a religious
               character include: <hi rend="italic">Risāla fī dalālat al-qad(a)r ʿalā al-tawḥīd
               </hi>(exact meaning uncertain, but dealing with the unity of God), ‘Treatise on the
               creation of humanity and that it was for the benefit and favor (of humanity) that it
               was made needy’ (<hi rend="italic">maqāla fī khalq al-insān wa-annahū min maṣlaḥatihi
                  wa-al-tafaḍḍul ʿalayhi juʿila muḥtājan</hi>), ‘Book on the history of the world’
                  (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb taʾrīkh al-ʿālam</hi>), and (in Syriac) ‘Chapters on the
               fear of God’ (<hi rend="italic">Reše d-deḥlat alāhā</hi>).</p>
                    <p>Finally mention should be made of Ḥunayn’s <hi rend="italic">Kitāb ādāb
                  al-falāsifa</hi>, also known as <hi rend="italic">Nawādir al-falāsifa</hi>, which
               is primarily a collection of sayings of Greek and Persian sages and philosophers (ed.
               Badawi; cf. Griffith).</p>

                    <p>Priest, theologian, exegete, physician, translator, and philosopher. His full name is
               Abū al-Faraj ʿAbd Allāh Ibn al‑Ṭayyib al-ʿIrāqī. He worked at the ʿAḍūdiyya Hospital
               in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> and served as secretary to both Cath. Yūḥannā b.
               Nāzūk (r. 1012–22) and Cath. <ref rend="bold">Eliya I</ref> (r.  1028–49). He was a
               student of al-Ḥasan b. Suwār b. al-Khammār (d. after 1017), who himself was a student
               of <ref rend="bold">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (d. 974). Ibn al-Ṭayyib’s students include ʿAlī
               b. ʿĪsā al-kaḥḥāl (d. after 1010), Abū al-Ḥusayn al-Baṣrī (d. 1044), and Ibn Buṭlān
               (d. 1066). He was also a contemporary of Ibn Sīnā (Avicenna).</p>
                    <p>Ibn al-Ṭayyib’s oeuvre includes more than forty items, all in Arabic, thatspan the
               fields of philosophy, medicine, theology, exegesis, and canon law. In philosophy, he
               wrote commentaries on the ‘Isagoge’ of <ref rend="bold">Porphyry</ref> (ed. Gyekye) and
               on several works by <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>, including the ‘Categories’(ed.
               Ferrari; ed. ʿAlī Ḥusayn al-Jābirī et al.). In medicine, he wrote several treatises
               in addition to commentaries on Hippocrates and <ref rend="bold">Galen</ref>. Among Ibn
               al-Ṭayyib’s most significant works in theology is his biblical commentary entitled
                  <hi rend="italic">Firdaws al-naṣrāniyya</hi>‘The Paradise of Christianity’ (Gen.
               ed. with FT Sanders). This exegetical work draws upon various Syriac sources,
               including the Scholion of <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>(fl. end of the 8th
               cent.), the ‘Selected Questions’ of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref>(d. 828), and
               the commentaries of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>(fl. ca. 850), and it served
               as one of the primary bridges by which E.-Syr. biblical exegesis reached <ref rend="bold">Coptic Christianity</ref>and <ref rend="bold">Ethiopic Christianity</ref>.
               In addition to the <hi rend="italic">Firdaws al-naṣrāniyya</hi>, Ibn al-Ṭayyib wrote
               separate commentaries on the Psalms (ed. Manquriyūs and Jirjis) and the Gospels (ed.
               Manquriyūs; cf. Faultless) as well as (probably) translated the <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref> into Arabic (see Baarda). He also authored a number of
               theological treatises. Finally, mention should be made of his <hi rend="italic">Fiqh
                  al-naṣrāniyya</hi>‘The law of Christianity’, which is a compilation of <ref rend="bold">juridical literature</ref> of the Ch. of E. (ed. Hoenerbach and
               Spies).</p>

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, martyred in Rome. His Letters (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 1025), written in Greek, survive in Syriac in three forms: 1. a short
               recension, consisting of ‘Letters to the Ephesians, the Romans, and Polycarp bishop
               of Smyrna’. This is known only in Syriac translation (ed. W. Cureton 1845, 1859; and
               W. Wright in J. B. Lightfoot, <hi rend="italic">The Apostolic Fathers</hi>, vol. 2.3
               [1889], 75–92); the Letter to the Romans was already quoted by <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref> (ed. Rignell, <hi rend="italic">Briefe</hi> [1941], 90).
               The Syriac was later translated into Armenian and Arabic; 2. the middle recension,
               consisting of four further Letters (to the Christians of Magnesia, Tralles,
               Philadelphia, and Smyrna); all seven are generally thought to be genuine; and 3. a
               long recension with some further letters, as well as interpolations in the seven
               genuine ones.</p>
                    <p>The account of Ignatius’s martyrdom (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 1036) was also
               translated into Syriac (ed. Wright, in Lightfoot, <hi rend="italic">Apostolic
                  Fathers</hi>, vol. 2.3, 103–24; and ed. Bedjan, <hi rend="italic">Acta Martyrum et

               Mtuka, and was given the baptismal name Shābā (ʿAbd al-Aḥad). He attended the
               seminary at <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> in 1923, and in 1931 began
               teaching at <ref rend="bold">Taw Mim Simkath</ref> in <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref>. He
               became a monk in 1933. He was sent to India in the same year where he was ordained a
               deacon and a priest. He returned in 1946 to <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>. In 1950 he
               was consecrated a bp. for Beirut and Syria, then Patr. in 1957. He transferred the
               patriarchate from <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref> to <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>. Under
               his patriarchate, the diocesan map of the church changed as a result of continuous
               migration to the West. He signed an agreement of understanding with Pope Paul VI in
               1971. He mastered liturgical music which he studied under Julius Elias Qoro while he
               was stationed in Malankara. In 1960, during a visit to NJ, he recorded the entire <hi rend="italic">Beth Gazo</hi>, the W.-Syr. musical reference, on reel tapes. He
               composed a collection of Syriac poems published under the title <hi rend="italic">Mimre mgabayo</hi> (Aleppo, 1959). His other works, all in Arabic, include a
               history of the church (2 vols.; 1953 and 1957), a history of the Syr. Orth. Church in

                </ab>
                <div type="body">
                    <p>The ‘solitary (one)’, a Syriac term for individuals engaged in ascetic and monastic
               endeavors, and for the Second Person of the Trinity. The root is <hi rend="italic">yḥd</hi> ‘one’, used by <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> to describe members of the consecrated elite of the Syr. church in
               the pre-monastic period. The ‘solitary one(s)’ or ‘single(s)’ had several
               connotations and contexts: 1. an individual who underwent ascetic disciplines removed
               from human society, often in isolated wilderness regions; 2. a person who was single,
               alone, unmarried, and celibate; 3. a person who was ‘single-minded’, not divided in
               heart and allegiance to God; and 4. a person who sought to emulate the Only Begotten
               One (Greek <hi rend="italic">monogenēs</hi>; Syr. <hi rend="italic">iḥidāyā</hi>) or
               Christ. In Aphrahaṭ, <hi rend="italic">iḥidāyā</hi> functions as an equivalent of <hi rend="italic">bar/ba(r)t qyāmā</hi> ‘son/daughter of the covenant’ (see <ref rend="bold">Bnay qyāmā</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Bnāt qyāmā</ref>), a more defined group
               of ascetics in the local church. ‘Solitary’ or ‘single’ in the sense of a person
               voluntarily isolated from contact with society did not apply here, for these
               individuals typically lived in small communities, so that the allusion to Christ the
                  <hi rend="italic">iḥidāyā</hi> was primary. Griffith has suggested ‘singles in
               God’s service’ as a better understanding of the sense of the term.</p>
                    <p>Some believe that the Greek term <hi rend="italic">monachos</hi> ‘monk’ was called
               into use to render Syr. <hi rend="italic">iḥidāyā</hi>, not the reverse as is usually

                    <p>By the late 5th to early 6th cent., <hi rend="italic">iḥidāyā</hi> came to denote the

               loosely to a monastery).</p>

               stone, pottery, plaster, mosaic, wood, metal, coins, liturgical objects and

               punching into metal, chiseling in stone, to incising, embroidering, and painting, or
               simple writing. Similar to archeological artifacts, inscriptions reach us directly
               rather than at the end of a process of transmission.</p>
                    <p>The earliest, ‘Old Syriac’, inscriptions predate Syr. Christianity and reflect the
               pagan Aramaic civilization of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> and Osrhoene between the
               early 1st and the middle of the 3rd cent. (the earliest dated inscription is from 6).
               The inscriptions are on stone, mosaic, pottery, and coins. Many have a funerary
               context. The <ref rend="bold">script</ref> is close to the later Syriac Esṭrangela,
               with some evidence, especially in the mosaics, of a more cursive script. The
               inscriptions reflect an archaic and less standardized form of the <ref rend="bold">Syriac language</ref>. An important morphological feature appears in the 3rd
               pers. masc. sing of the imperfect form of the verb, for which early inscriptions have
               a preformative <hi rend="italic">yodh</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">nun</hi>,
               the latter being one of the hallmarks of later Syriac (there also is evidence that
                  <hi rend="italic">yodh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nun</hi> coexisted for some
               time). The recent collection by Drijvers and Healey (1999) contains ca. 100 items. A
               few new ones have been published in recent years (see esp. Healey 2006, dated 194).
               Three mid-3rd-cent. legal documents, written on parchment and discovered in or around
                  <ref rend="bold">Dura-Europos</ref>, reflect the same cultural milieu prior to, and
               outside of, Syr. Christianity, and are, therefore, often studied in conjunction with
               the Edessene inscriptions (see <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac documents</ref>).</p>
                    <p>There is a hiatus between the pagan and the earliest Christian Syriac inscriptions.
               The earliest Christian inscriptions from the Syriac-speaking area are in Greek, for
               example the Greek inscription in the baptistery of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>
               (dated 359/60), which <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> must have known. There is also a
               geographical shift. Whereas the ‘Old Syriac’ inscriptions are only found to the east
               of the Euphrates, Christian Syriac inscriptions appear west of the Euphrates from the
               late 4th cent. onwards. Among the earliest dated Christian Syriac inscriptions is a
               bilingual Greek-Syriac inscription from Babisqa, to the southwest of <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>, dated 389.</p>
                    <p>Christian Syriac inscriptions become more numerous in the 5th cent. and continue to
               the present day. Many have been unearthed starting in the 19th cent. Although some
               remained <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi>, others were transferred to museums worldwide
               or ended up in private collections. For many inscriptions, in particular those that
               came to light outside regular excavations, the provenance and archeological context
               are not known. The main geographical areas will be briefly surveyed here, with
               special reference to the most recent publications (for basic references, see Briquel
               Chatonnet et al. 2004).</p>
                    <label type="subsubsection">Syria</label>
                    <p>Many inscriptions are known from the hinterland of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, from
               the <ref rend="bold">Apamea</ref> and Aleppo region, and further east, from the Middle
               Euphrates. They include monumental inscriptions on stone and mosaic, which often
               refer to building activities and contain dates and names of bishops or other
               historical figures. Important examples of recently published mosaic inscriptions are:
               an inscription from Huweija Halawa, on the Euphrates, 471 (Donceel-Voûte 1988,
               148–9); an inscription of unknown provenance, now in New Jersey, 504 (Steiner 1990);
               an inscription from Tall Biʿa, near Kallinikos, 509, mentioning bp. <ref rend="bold">Pawlos of Kallinikos</ref> (Krebernik 1991); and an inscription from Maʿar Zayta,
               514/15, mentioning bp. Peter of Apamea (Harrak 1995). From the northeast of the
               country, inscriptions from Tell Tuneinir (Fuller 1998) and Qasrok (Talay 2003) have
               been published in recent years.</p>
                    <label type="subsubsection">Ṭur ʿAbdin</label>
                    <p>The inscriptions from this region have been conveniently brought together by Palmer
               (1987). This publication includes improved editions of previously known inscriptions
               as well as a number of new ones. The earliest dated inscription is from the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref>, 534. A significant number of
               inscriptions are dated or datable to the 8th cent. In addition to building
               inscriptions, there are a number of funerary texts, often written in a literary,
               semi-formulaic language.</p>
                    <label type="subsubsection">Iraq</label>
                    <p>An edition by A. Harrak appeared in 2010. Although the earliest dated inscription is
               from 709/10, some undated inscriptions may be earlier. For the early period,
               inscriptions from <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref> help to reconstruct the Christian
               history of that important city. An ostracon from the <ref rend="bold">Ḥirta</ref>
               region, which came to light in the 1980s, contains quotations from the E.-Syr. <hi rend="italic">Ḥudrā</hi> for the season of Epiphany (Brock 2004). The funerary
               inscriptions from the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Rabban Hormizd</ref> near <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref> belong to the modern period (15th–19th cent.) (Harrak
               2003).</p>
                    <label type="subsubsection">Central Mesopotamia</label>
                    <p>In Central Mesopotamia, in the pre-Islamic and early-Islamic period a number of
               magical texts were written in Syriac (while similar texts from the same region exist
               in Jewish Babylonian Aramaic and Mandaic). There are charms for the love-sick and
               prayers against illness or other misfortune. Many bowls have been unearthed on which
               the text is written in spiral fashion around the inside, while other texts are
               written on sheets of leather or metal. Syriac texts are written either in Esṭrangela
               or in a script that has been called ‘Proto-Manichean’. Moriggi (2004) recently
               studied the language of the bowls; three leather amulets were published by Gignoux
               (1987).</p>
                    <label type="subsubsection">Egypt</label>
                    <p>Syr. monks left traces of their presence in several of the early Egyptian
               monasteries. The most important collection of Syriac inscriptions is from <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>, where painted inscriptions start appearing on the
               walls of the main church ca. 800. In addition to independent painted inscriptions
               recording building activities, visits, the passing away of monks, or other
               significant events, there are Syriac names and captions on wall paintings. Important
               inscriptions on the wooden doors of the church are from the period of abbot <ref rend="bold">Mushe of Nisibis</ref> in the first half of the 10th cent., while a
               liturgical fan in bronze carries a beautiful inscription dated 1202/3.</p>
                    <label type="subsubsection">Central and East Asia</label>
                    <p>Along the Silk Road Syriac inscriptions are an important testimony to the mission
               work of the Ch. of E. in Central and East Asia. Many Syriac graffiti have come to
               light in Urgut, Uzbekistan, and numerous tombstones, inscribed with Syriac and dated
               or datable between the mid–13th and mid–14th cent. have been found in Kyrgyzstan,
               where the capital Bishkek must have had a sizable community. Further east, in <ref rend="bold">China</ref>, the stele of Si-ngan-fou (in <ref rend="bold">Xi’an</ref>),
               dated 781, is among the most well-known Syriac inscriptions. In addition to its long
               Chinese text, it has a Syriac list of bishops, monks, and other ecclesiastics. Many
               Syriac inscriptions from the 13th and 14th cent., mostly of funerary content, have
               been found near the city of Huocheng (in Xinjiang) as well as in inner Mongolia, near
               Beijing, and in the harbor towns of Yangzhou and Quanzhou. For preliminary
               assessments of these texts, see the publications by Klein (2001), Niu Ruji (2004,
               2005), and Borbone (2005).</p>
                    <label type="subsubsection">Elsewhere</label>
                    <p>A smaller number of Syriac inscriptions exist in Iran. Many are from the region
               around <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref> and mostly belong to the modern period. The Syriac
               inscriptions in Kerala, India, are dated between the 16th cent. and the present day;
               a volume by F. Briquel Chatonnet, A. Desreumaux, and J. Thekeparampil has recently
               appeared. In Lebanon the situation is more complex. The earliest inscription, on a
               lintel, is dated 547/8; several 8th-cent. inscriptions of Kamid al-Loz reflect the
               presence of an E.-Syr. community; and many inscriptions are found on wall paintings
               in medieval and modern Maronite and Greek-Orthodox churches. Pilgrims and visitors
               from the Syriac homelands left Syriac inscriptions on the Sinai Peninsula, in Cyprus,
               and in Palestine/Israel. The Syriac inscriptions at the entrance of the Church of the
               Holy Sepulcher in <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> were recently published and studied
               by Brock, Goldfus, and Kofsky (2006–2007).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Conclusion</label>
                    <p>Syriac inscriptions reflect the linguistic and cultural complexities of the worlds in
               which Syriac Christians lived. Whereas in the earliest period Syriac inscriptions
               often show the coexistence of Syriac and Greek (and of Syriac, Greek, and Arabic in
               the famous inscription of Zebed, to the southeast of Aleppo, dated 511/2), many of
               the later inscriptions include, or are accompanied by, texts in Coptic, Arabic,
               Chinese, Uigur, Turkic, and Malayalam, or show interesting cases of <ref rend="bold">Garshuni</ref>, i.e. the use of the Syriac script to write non-Syriac languages.
               A similar complexity is found in the use of different eras. Although in the early
               period local eras are occasionally used (esp. the ones of Antioch and Apamea), and
               the dating by ‘indiction’ (Syr. <hi rend="italic">hndqṭywnʾ</hi>) is exceptionally
               found, the most common dating system throughout the centuries is the era of the
               Seleucids (known as ‘of Alexander’, ‘of the Macedonians’, or ‘of the Greeks’). The
               Hijra dating is found as early as the 8th cent., and for the later period many local
               eras are used as well as the common Christian era. Finally, it should be noted that
               inscriptions have contributed to our understanding of the writing direction in
               Syriac, as distinct from the reading direction. Most Syriac inscriptions are written
               vertically, inscribed downwards (Voigt 1997).</p>

                    <p>Greek monastic writer of uncertain identity; author of the Asceticon (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 5555). Two possible Isaiah’s are known, Isaiah of Scetis
               (early 5th cent.) and Isaiah of Gaza (d. 491). The suggestion (by G. Krüger, in <hi rend="italic">Die sogenannte Kirchengeschichte des Zacharias Rhetor</hi>, ed.
               K.  Ahrens and G. Krüger [1899], 385–6), that these two were really a single person,
               was widely accepted until Draguet’s edition of the Syriac translation. Draguet firmly
               distinguished the two and saw the Asceticon as the work of Isaiah of Scetis.
               Subsequent scholarship has hesitated in accepting this, but a possible solution is
               that the earliest form of the work (now discernable through Draguet’s edition) goes
               back to Isaiah of Scetis, while the later form represents the editorial work of
               Isaiah of Gaza, a friend of <ref rend="bold">Peter the Iberian</ref> and of <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref> (this Isaiah’s Life was written by <ref rend="bold">Zacharias</ref>; ed. with LT, by E. W.  Brooks [CSCO 7–8; 1907]). The identity,
               or otherwise, of the two Isaiah’s is reflected in recent dictionary articles: some
               treat them together (thus Regnault), while others deal with them separately (thus
               Aubert). The Syriac translation of the Asceticon survives in many mss. and (for
               several of the Discourses) in two different forms. The work was clearly widely read
               in Syriac monastic circles, both East and West. In the late 7th cent. <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ</ref> composed an extensive commentary on it, and a further anonymous
               commentary is also preserved in an incomplete form.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, and Cath. A native of Kashkar, Isḥaq
               was elected Cath. in the first year of Yazdgard  I (r. 399–420), after a long period
               of persecution and hardship for the Christians in the Persian Empire. Relations
               between the Roman and Persian Empires improved at the end of the 4th cent. In this
               new political environment, Isḥaq was able to lay the foundation for the organization
               of the Christian communities, with the formal approval of the Persian authorities. In
               this process Isḥaq worked together with bp. <ref rend="bold">Marutha of
                  Maypherqaṭ</ref>, an envoy from the Roman Empire. The Synod of 410, held in
               Seleucia-Ctesiphon, was the highlight of Isḥaq’s tenure. Its official account is
               preserved in the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. The text of the account is
               followed by a Creed, by 21 canons, and by 33 signatures of bishops. Some canons deal
               with the organization of the church, church discipline, and the relations among
               bishops. Along with the see of Seleucia-Ctesiphon (whose incumbent is given primacy
               ‘in all the regions of the East’, canon  12), the following five cities have
               metropolitan bishops (canon  21): <ref rend="bold">Beth Lapaṭ</ref> (Beth Huzaye), <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, Prat and Mayshan, <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref>, and Karka.
               Other canons contain instructions about liturgy (canon  9) and about the celebration
               of Christian feasts (canon 13). Some canons specifically aim at creating uniformity
               between East and West (i.e. Christianity within the Roman Empire) and parallels exist
               with canons of the Council of Nicea (325) and of other councils within the Roman
               Empire. In addition to the Synodicon Orientale, the creed and the canons of the synod
               are also preserved in the Syr. Orth. tradition (published by Lamy). For the creed,
               the latter has preserved a more original text, while the E.-Syr. text underwent later
               revision. The tone of the entire account is very optimistic with regard to both the
               peaceful coexistence of the Roman and Persian Empires and the freedom given to
               Christians to practice their religion and to organize themselves. Only a few years
               later, however, the situation of Christians in the Persian Empire again deteriorated.
               The synod of 419 (under Cath. <ref rend="bold">Yahbalaha</ref>) clearly reflects the
               increased tension, while the Synod of 424 (under Cath. <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ</ref>)
               was held in an atmosphere of crisis. As evidenced in the Synodicon Orientale,
               however, Isḥaq’s work retained its significance and continued to be seen as
               foundational for the organizational structure of the Ch. of E.</p>

                    <p>Priest and writer. One of three early persons named Isḥaq whose works may have
               survived in a single corpus (see <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Antioch</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Edessa</ref>). According to a letter from <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub
                  of Edessa</ref> to <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Litarba</ref> (Letter 14; ms. Brit.
               Libr. Add. 12,172, f. 123r–v), this Isḥaq was a student of <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> while he was in <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>, and then continued his
               studies there under Ephrem’s pupil Zenobius. It is more likely that Isḥaq studied
               with Zenobius than with Ephrem. In any case, after his studies, according to Yaʿqub’s
               letter, Isḥaq journeyed to Rome and to Constantinople during the time of Arcadius
               (395–408). This report probably identifies him with the Isḥaq mentioned in both the
               Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>of Mitylene (I.9) and the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>(I.193). According to the same letter of
               Yaʿqub, Isḥaq composed one <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> on the secular games held in
               Rome and another on the fall of Rome to Alaric in 410. Neither of these <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, however, has survived. After his stay in Constantinople,
               during which time he had been imprisoned for unknown reasons, he returned to his
               native Amid and then became a priest. The date of his death is unknown.</p>

               the Fuller (ca. 471–88), Isḥaq went to <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> where he became
               involved in the controversy then raging over the Trisagion. According to Yaʿqub (cf.
               also, <hi rend="italic">Chronica Minora</hi>, vol.  2, 217), Isḥaq saw a man who was
               carrying around a parrot that had been trained to recite the Trisagion against those
               who opposed its addition to the liturgy. Isḥaq was so impressed by this sight that he
               wrote a long <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> on this event. It is the longest <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> in the collection of his works and is perhaps his best
               known title, though its contents are far less known. It is likely that this is the
               same Isḥaq whom the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Edessa</ref> and other sources claim
               flourished in the 450s. The Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>
               (II.viii.9) and the dependent Ecclesiastical Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref> (I.165) both seem to have conflated this Isḥaq with <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Edessa</ref>.</p>
                    <p>To this Isḥaq is attributed a very large corpus of works which remains only partially
               and incompletely edited. Approximately two hundred works have been identified, nearly
               all of which are <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> written in the seven syllable meter.
               Many are on ascetic subjects, although there are many on biblical and theological
               themes. Some of these works have also been combed for the data they reveal on
               contemporary practices of local pagan worship. All the works in this corpus cannot
               have come from the same hand. Although their early transmission is almost entirely in
               mss. of W.-Syr. provenance, the later ms. tradition occasionally attributes some of
               them to the great E.-Syr. mystic <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>.</p>

                    <p>Priest and theological writer. Even less is known of this Isḥaq than of <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Amid</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Antioch</ref>. According
               to a letter of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> to <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of
                  Litarba</ref> (Letter 14; ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,172, f. 123r–v), our only source
               of information, this Isḥaq was a priest of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> during the
               early part of the 6th cent. During the tenure of Pawlos as Metropolitan of Edessa
               (510–522), Isḥaq was of the orthodox (i.e. miaphysite) party. However, when Pawlos
               was deposed and subsequently replaced by Asclepius, a Chalcedonian, Isḥaq switched
               camps and became a Chalcedonian. In support of his new party, Isḥaq wrote a number of
                  <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> against non-Chalcedonian positions. Certain <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> against ‘Nestorians’ in the collection of Isḥaq of
               Antioch may, however, be from this Isḥaq’s miaphysite period, when he may also have
               been that Isḥaq occasionally mentioned by <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> in
               his letters.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Influential monastic author. Originating from <ref rend="bold">Beth Qaṭraye</ref>, he
               was made bp. of <ref rend="bold">Nineveh</ref> (<ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>) by Cath.
               Gewargis (661–81), perhaps ca. 676/80. After a short while, however, he left (‘for
               reasons which only God knows’, as one of the two short biographical accounts puts it)
               and became a hermit, attached to the Monastery of Rabban Shabur, in the region of
               Shuster. His writings on monastic spirituality come down in several ‘Parts’, three of
               which are now known. The First Part, with 82  chapters, evidently circulated widely,
               and much of it was translated into Greek at the Chalcedonian Monastery of Mar Saba
               (St. Sabbas), near <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>, in the late 8th or early 9th cent.
               From Greek, his works were subsequently translated into many other languages, in
               particular into Slavonic (whence they were included in the Russian edition of the
               ‘Philokalia’). This Greek translation also included (under Isḥaq’s name) three short
               works by <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref>, and an abbreviated form of <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos</ref>’s ‘Letter to Patricius’. The current printed editions
               of the Greek translation go back to that by N. Theotokis (1770), and have a different
               chapter numbering from that of the Syriac (a much-needed new edition of the Greek
               text is in preparation by M. Pirard). A Second Part, consisting of 41 chapters, is
               preserved complete in a single early ms. The long third chapter of this Part consists
               of four ‘Centuries’ of short sayings on spiritual knowledge (modelled on <ref rend="bold">Evagrius</ref>’s ‘Kephalaia Gnostica’). A Third Part has also recently
               come to light, in a ms. in Tehran copied ca. 1900; this contains 17 chapters, two of
               which are duplicates with the First Part, and one with the Second Part. Though the
               Second and Third Parts were not translated into Greek, some chapters from them have
               been identified in Arabic, and they were both evidently known in Syriac monastic
               circles outside the Ch. of E., as well. The ‘Book of Grace’, probably by <ref rend="bold">Shemʿon d-Ṭaybutheh</ref>, has sometimes been wrongly attributed to
               Isḥaq.</p>
                    <p>Isḥaq’s monastic spirituality draws on many sources, both Syriac and Greek (in
               Syriac translation); two authors would appear to have been particularly appreciated
               by Isḥaq, <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref> and Evagrius. His teaching lays great
               emphasis on the immensity of divine love and on the need for humanity to respond to
               this with wonder and humility.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Priest and author, also known as Asko Shbadnaya and Isḥaq Qardaḥa Eshbadnaya. From
               his name, Isḥaq is presumed to be from a village named Shbaden or Shbad in ‘the land
               of the Sendaye’, a region northeast of Zakho. Isḥaq is known to have written several
               works, including three liturgical poems composed in 1439/40 for the Fast of the
               Ninevites, the commemoration of St. George, and the Feast of the Finding of the
               Cross. Isḥaq’s masterpiece is a long poem entitled ‘Poem on the Divine Economy from
               In the Beginning Until Eternity’, divided into 30 <hi rend="italic">sedre</hi> or
               sections, each on a separate theme. This poem employs numerous acrostic patterns and
               includes dozens of Greek words written in Syriac script. The Greek words and some
               obscure Syriac words are supplied with interlinear or marginal definitions in Syriac
               or, rarely, Arabic. After most sections of poetry, Isḥaq added a section of
               commentary explaining his poem by means of quotations from earlier Syriac and Greek
               authors ranging from <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> and Irenaeus to <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mospuestia</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref>. Some of these quotations are extensive. In
               composing a commentary on his own poem, Isḥaq may have been imitating <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ of Nisibis</ref>, who also composed a commentary on his own poetry.
               Isḥaq also composed an acrostic riddle of six lines which was often transmitted with
               his liturgical poems. Finally, a short acrostic poem about the trials afflicting the
               Church, which is contained in a single ms. of Isḥaq’s masterpiece, is probably also
               composed by Isḥaq. The continued importance of Isḥaq is indicated by the large number
               of mss. of his works and the fact that he is one of the few later authors included in
               histories of Syriac literature and cited by <ref rend="bold">Toma Audo</ref> in his
               Syriac dictionary.</p>

                <ab type="infobox">(d. 828) [Ch. of E.]</ab>
                <div type="body">
                    <p>Cath. (823–28), author of commentaries on the entire Bible. Ishoʿ bar Nun was born in
               the village of Beth Gabbare on the Tigris, near <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, around
               745. He studied with <ref rend="bold">Abraham bar Dashandad</ref> and, possibly after a
               short period of teaching at <ref rend="bold">Seleucia</ref>, became a monk at the Great
               Monastery on Mt. Izla (founded by <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Kashkar</ref>), where he
               also taught. Ishoʿ bar Nun later moved to <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> and then to
               Mosul, where he lived in the Monastery of Elijah. The chronology of these successive
               stays is highly uncertain as the many different sources provide at times conflicting
               information. In 823, Ishoʿ bar Nun was elected Cath. of the Ch. of E., as the
               successor of <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>, with whom he is said to have had a
               difficult relationship. He died in 828. Ishoʿ bar Nun should in all likelihood be
               distinguished from his namesake and contemporary who was bp. of Ram Hormizd in Beth
               Huzaye and who enjoyed the support of Timotheos, in whose letters he is occasionally
               mentioned.</p>
                    <p>In his capacity as cath., Ishoʿ bar Nun issued a number of canons, mainly dealing
               with matrimonial and hereditary law, which were incorporated in the collection of
               Syriac law books (ed. Sachau, with an addition by Sauget). In addition, Ishoʿ bar Nun
               is known as the author of a short treatise on homographs, which is extant in mss. in
               Iraq, but remains unpublished. His ‘Consolation Homilies’ and letters are only known
               in fragments. Ishoʿ bar Nun’s major work, which is preserved in its entirety (ms.
               Cambridge, Add. 2017), is his collection of ‘Selected Questions’ (<hi rend="italic">Šuʾʾāle mgabbayyā</hi>) on the OT and NT. Presenting his work in the form of
               questions and answers, Ishoʿ bar Nun conveys much of the traditional exegesis of the
               Ch. of E. and respectfully quotes <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. Yet,
               he often goes his own way, creating more room for spiritual and even allegorizing
               exegesis. He may have found the inspiration for this new approach in his monastic
               background and in his familiarity with the works of <ref rend="bold">Evagrius of
                  Pontus</ref>. Thus expanding the horizons of E.-Syr. biblical interpretation, he
               had a lasting impact on the later tradition, the more so since much of Ishoʿ bar
               Nun’s work was incorporated into the normative commentaries by <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>. Unfortunately, only small parts of the ‘Selected
               Questions’ have been published so far.</p>

                <ab type="infobox">Ishoʿ Maruzaya, ʿĪsā al-Marwazī (9th cent.) [Ch. of E.]</ab>
                <div type="body">
                    <p>Author of a Syriac Lexicon. From his <hi rend="italic">nisba</hi>it is known that he
               was from Merv, an important city in the Abbasid period located on the lower course of
               the Murghab river in the northeast fringes of Persia. That he is the author of a
               Lexicon can be established from the preface to the Lexicon of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ
                  bar ʿAli</ref> (second half of the 9th cent.). According to Bar ʿAli’s patron,
               Abraham, the Lexicon of Ishoʿ of Merv was ‘composed irregularly and without order’
                  (<hi rend="italic">lā mṭakksāʾit wa-lbar men sedrā ʿbid</hi>). The definitions
               given by Ishoʿ of Merv are also said to differ at times from those in the Lexicon of
                  <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref>(d. 873). Despite this somewhat negative
               evaluation, Bar ʿAli made use of the Lexicon of Ishoʿ of Merv, along with that of
               Ḥunayn, when compiling his own Lexicon.</p>
                    <p>According to R. Duval, Ishoʿ of Merv is to be identified with Zekarya of Merv, who is
               often cited in the Lexicon of <ref rend="bold">Ḥasan Bar Bahlul</ref>(mid-10th cent.).
               Bar Bahlul, however, never explicitly identifies Zekarya of Merv with Ishoʿ of Merv.
               In addition, in one instance, Bar Bahlul cites Ishoʿ of Merv by name (Duval, 835.14).
               Thus, without further evidence, it seems best to assume that Ishoʿ of Merv and
               Zekarya of Merv are two distinct individuals (so also Baumstark).</p>
                    <p>A lexicographer from Merv is also mentioned in the ‘Catalogue’ of <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, vol. 3, 257–58), but it
               is unclear whether this person is to be identified with Ishoʿ of Merv or Zekarya of
               Merv.</p>

                    <p>Author of a treatise on secular law; metropolitan bp. of <ref rend="bold">Fars</ref>.
               Ishoʿbokht was consecrated by Cath. Ḥenanishoʿ, most likely <ref rend="bold">Ḥenanishoʿ
                  II</ref> (d. 779/80). He wrote his law book in Persian, from which language it was
               translated into Syriac at the instigation of Cath. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>,
               probably after Ishoʿbokht’s death. It is divided into six books. The first is of a
               general and theoretical nature. Books 2 and 3 deal with matrimonial law. Book 4 is
               devoted to inheritance law; book 5 to donations, testaments, and obligations. Book 6
               deals with the right of appeal. Ishoʿbokht brings his knowledge of biblical law,
               Roman law, Persian law (and to some extent even Islamic law) together and aims at
               creating a unified system that would transcend local differences existing among
               Christians. Ishoʿbokht is familiar with traditions that are incorporated in the
               Persian ‘Book of thousand judgments’ (<hi rend="italic">Mādīgān ī hazār
               dādestān</hi>) and his work has been used by scholars of Persian-Sasanian law
               (Macuch). Ishoʿbokht’s engagement with Zoroastrian law and customs was used by Sachau
               as an argument for dating him earlier than <ref rend="bold">Shemʿon</ref>, from whose
               law book Zoroastrian doctrines and practices are largely absent (see under Shemʿon).
               Dauvillier regards Ishoʿbokht as a powerful and original mind, and perhaps the best
               jurist of the Ch. of E. (340). Preserved in the important ms. Alqosh Syr. 169, the
               primary source for the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>, this law book served
               as a source for later jurists. It also exists in an Arabic translation (see Sachau,
               xvi–xvii).</p>
                    <p>Ishoʿbokht’s knowledge and interest in philosophy seem to be reflected in some other
               works, extracts of which have been preserved: a commentary on the Ten Categories
               (e.g. in ms. Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Add. 2812,vii and in ms. Alqosh 65.5) and a note
               on ‘possibilities’ (<hi rend="italic">meṭṭol meddem d-metmaṣyānwātā ennen</hi>: ms.
               Berlin 88.32). There is also an extract from a work that may have been dealing with
               the Hexaemeron (ms. Alqosh 45.3). None of these fragments have been edited or
               studied. It cannot be ascertained whether they all belong to the same author and
               whether they were originally written in Syriac.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Bp. of Ḥdatta, author of commentaries on both the OT and NT. Little is known of
               Ishoʿdad’s biography. A native of the city of Maru or Merv, in present-day
               Turkmenistan, he became bp. of Ḥdatta (al-Ḥadītha), to the southeast of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, ca. 837. In 852, he was a candidate for the patriarchal
               throne, but he failed to be elected.</p>
                    <p>Ishoʿdad’s commentaries present the most expansive form of E.-Syr. biblical
               interpretation. They are preserved in a good number of mss. and they served as
               sources not only for subsequent E.-Syr. commentators, but also for W.-Syr. authors,
               such as <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Both the theological concepts and the exegetical principles of the commentaries
               largely reflect the ideas of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> as they had
               developed and were transmitted in the later E.-Syr. schools. Works of other authors,
               however, were also part of the E.-Syr. exegetical tradition, especially those of <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Basil of Caesarea</ref>, the Cappadocians,
               and <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref>, as well as exegetical writings by various
               authors of the Schools of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Seleucia</ref>, among them <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>, Cath. Mar <ref rend="bold">Aba</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Ḥenana</ref>of <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref>. The
               use of such a variety of sources sometimes led Ishoʿdad to distance himself from the
               interpretations of Theodore of Mopsuestia. A notable example is the commentary on the
               Song of Songs, for which Ishoʿdad juxtaposed the opinion of Theodore, who had
               expressed reservations as to the inspired character of the biblical book and its
               usefulness for the Christian reader, and the straightforward allegorical
               interpretations of authors such as <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nyssa</ref>, John
               Chrysostom, and others.</p>
                    <p>Some of the works that Ishoʿdad used had remained outside the scope of interest of
               his E.-Syr. predecessors. One example is the biblical commentaries of <ref rend="bold">Eusebius of Emesa</ref>, excerpts of which Ishoʿdad incorporated in his work.
               Another example is the <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref>, the work of the Syr. Orth.
               bp. <ref rend="bold">Pawlos of Tella</ref>, which was introduced in the Ch. of E.
               around 800 and from which Ishoʿdad was the first to draw biblical quotations of
               either the Septuagint or the later Greek versions (Aquila, Symmachus, and
               Theodotion).</p>

               concerns monastic foundations, mostly of the late Sasanian and early Arab periods.
               The work consists of 140 short notices about monastic figures, mostly founders of
               monasteries, beginning with <ref rend="bold">Mar Awgen</ref> (traditionally dated to
               the 4th cent.) and continuing until the mid 9th cent. It has also been suggested (by

               survives only in Arabic (ed. A. Scher, in PO 4.3 [1907], 5.2 [1910], 7.2 [1910], and

               is also the author of a long poem (unpublished) on Mar Yawnan, founder of a famous

                    <p>Minor author, maph. (1687–1709), and Patr. (1709–23). Born in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, Isḥoq became a monk at <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> and
               was ordained priest in 1669 by Maph. Yaldo. In 1673, he helped in repairing this
               monastery for which he was sent to prison by the <hi rend="italic">wali</hi> of
               Mosul, along with the maph. and another monk named Giwargis. Isḥoq was consecrated
               bp. for the monastery in 1684 by Patr. ʿAbdulmasīḥ I. Later, he was installed as
               maph. in 1687 by his uncle Patr. <ref rend="bold">Giwargis II</ref> and was given a
               mandate to govern the entire church, not just the East. He succeeded his uncle to the
               patriarchate in 1709; he was installed in <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref> on 8 Feb. Due to
               deteriorating health, he voluntarily abdicated in 1723 and left for Mosul where he
               died in 1724. He was buried in the Church of Mor Thoma. Isḥoq wrote a brief grammar,
               mainly on morphology, in 15 chapters of which a few mss. survive.</p>

                    <p>Last bp. of Dayro d-Mor Abay. Little is known about his early life. He may have been
               from Qilleth and may have joined <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>. He was
               consecrated bp. of Dayro d-Mor Abay with the unusual Syriac, rather than Greek,
               honorific title Isḥoq. He may have participated in the installation of the
               anti-patriarch Shemʿun of Maʿdan ca. 1699. After his death in 1730, the diocese of
               Mor Abay, which then included Ṣawro, Qilleth, and its villages, Bafawah, ʿWein,
               Kharbah and Maʿsarteh, became part of the diocese of <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>.</p>

                    <p>Cath. (628–45) and author. Originating from Gdala (in <ref rend="bold">Beth
                  ʿArbaye</ref>), he evidently studied at the <ref rend="bold">School of
               Nisibis</ref>, and was one of the group who left the School ca. 597 in protest
               against the teaching of the director, <ref rend="bold">Ḥenana</ref>of <ref rend="bold">                  Adiabene</ref>. According to the Khuzistan Chronicle he had married ‘in his
               youth’, but nevertheless was appointed bp. of <ref rend="bold">Balad</ref> (whether or
               not as a widower is unclear), before becoming Cath. In 630 he was sent by Queen Boran
               on an embassy to Heraclius, together with the future <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb
                  III</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Sahdona</ref>; the meeting with the Byzantine emperor
               took place in <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>. Although late sources claim he
               corresponded with Muḥammad and met ʿUmar, in fact he appears to have left <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> when the city was taken by the Arabs in 637/8
               and withdrawn to <ref rend="bold">Karka</ref> in <ref rend="bold">Beth Garmai</ref>. His
               only surviving writings are: a long letter to Rabban Abraham of Beth Madaye on
               christology (ed. Sako, with FT), a profession of faith (preserved only in Arabic;
               text and tr. in Sako, 59–60), and the <hi rend="italic">tešboḥtā</hi> ‘Our father in
               heaven, holy in his nature ...’, which is also attributed in some mss. to <ref rend="bold">Babai the Great</ref>. The Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref>
               provides a Letter in reply to Barṣawma, bp. of Susa, who had accused Ishoʿyahb of
               compromising the christological position of the Ch. of E. when he met Heraclius;
               according to Sako, however, this is not genuine.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Patr. (649–59), author, and liturgical reformer. He was born in Kuplana (on the
               Greater Zab, in <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref>), the son of a prominent landowner
               named Bastomag. He became a monk of the nearby <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Beth
                  ʿAbe</ref>, but was appointed bp. of <ref rend="bold">Nineveh</ref> (ca. 629), and a
               decade or so later, metropolitan of <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref>, finally to become
               Cath. in 649. He is credited with many liturgical reforms, though the nature and
               extent of these is unclear; it seems that, among other things, it was he who limited
               the number of Anaphoras in use to the present three. In his ‘Catalogue’ <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> attributes to him the arrangement of the <hi rend="italic">Ḥudrā</hi>, the Baptismal Liturgy, and rite for the Consecration of
               a new church; this attribution is also found in the mss. of all these, but the
               emergence of these liturgical books is likely to have been much more complex (in the
               case of the Baptismal Service, the mss. record a further reform by the Cath.
               Eliya  III [1176–90]). A set of Questions and Answers on liturgical topics (in ms.
               Mingana Syr. 566) is also attributed to him, but Van Unnik, who edited them, showed
               that they must belong to a later date, and he allocated them to <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb IV</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Ishoʿyahb III is much more certainly the author of a long ‘Life of Ishoʿsabran’, a
               martyr of the late Sasanian Empire (ed. Chabot, with French summary), and of a
               collection of 106 Letters (ed. R. Duval, with LT). The Letters are arranged
               chronologically in three groups, those written while he was bp. (52), while he was
               metropolitan (32), and while he was Cath. (22), though the chronological allocation
               in some cases cannot be correct. These convey a great deal of information about the
               life of the Ch. of E. during the period of the transition from Persian to Arab rule.
               (The edition by P. Scott-Moncrieff [1904] of Ishoʿyahb’s letters written while he was
               bp. omits Letters 1 and 12 in Duval’s edition; he gives handy brief summaries in
               English of each letter. His projected full translation never appeared).</p>

               author, mostly writing in Arabic. He originated from the Nisibis region. He first
               became bp. of Mardin under the name Yawsep, and took the name Ishoʿyahb when he
               became ‘metropolitan bp. of Nisibis and Armenia’ (after the E.-Syr. metropolitan see
               of Khilat had been given up and added to Nisibis). Wright assumes that he became bp.
               of Nisibis in 1190; as bp. of Nisibis he is attested under Cath. Sabrishoʿ IV
               (1222–25); he must have died before 1233 (Teule 2006, 246).</p>
                    <p>While still bp. of Mardin, he wrote a metrical tract on points, ‘Net of points’ (<hi rend="italic">Mṣidtā d-nuqze</hi>), divided in eight sections, which in mss. is
               often transmitted alongside the grammatical works of <ref rend="bold">Eliya of
                  Nisibis</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref> (e.g., ms. Brit. Libr.
               Add. 25,876: Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi>, vol. 3, 1175a–1179a). A
               further grammatical work on Syriac, ‘Elucidation in Syriac grammar’ (<hi rend="italic">Manhrānuthā ba-grammaṭiqi suryāytā</hi>) is in two columns, Syr. and
               Arabic (e.g., ms. Paris, 370: Briquel Chatonnet, <hi rend="italic">Manuscrits

               theological or polemical content, as well as his letters are in Arabic, often with
               introductory formulas in Syriac. Some of his Arabic works exhibit knowledge of Arabic
               philosophy (Teule 2006).</p>

                    <p>Syriac-speaking Christians, along with Arabic-speaking Christians whose patristic and
               liturgical heritage was largely Syriac, were among those Christians most immediately
               present to Islam in its origins. Throughout early Islamic history, especially in the
               period stretching from the earliest Islamic conquests in the territories of the
               Oriental Patriarchates in the first half of the 7th cent., up to the Mongol
               destruction of <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> in 1258 and beyond, interactions between
               Syriac Christians and Muslims were a regular feature of political, intellectual, and
               cultural life in the caliphate. Thereafter, and up to the present day,
               Syriac-speaking communities have continued to be a significant, cultural presence in
               the Islamic milieu, especially in the modern states of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon,
               Palestine, Iraq, and Iran, where so-called ‘Neo-Aramaic’ dialects (see <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref>; <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref>; <ref rend="bold">Ṭuroyo</ref>), with
               their roots in classical Syriac, are still spoken and the classical literature is
               still prized.</p>
                    <p>By the middle of the 7th cent., when Islamic rule was firmly established in the
               Levant, the main Christian, confessional communities among the Syriac-speaking
               peoples were already firmly established. In due course, Syriac- and Arabic-speaking
               Christians and Muslims alike came to refer to them as ‘Nestorians’, ‘Jacobites’, and
               ‘Melkites’, adopting the polemically inspired denominational labels devised by each
               community’s theological and Christological adversaries. Already in the 6th and early
               7th cent., these communities were well established in the peripheral regions of
               Arabia (Hainthaler), with well-known congregations along the Persian Gulf, in
               Ḥaḍramawt and <ref rend="bold">Nagran</ref> in south Arabia (Trimingham; Tardy), among
               the Lakhmids and Ghassanids on the north eastern and western fringes of the desert
               (Shahid), and the tribal groups Christianized by the monks of Palestine and the
               Sinai. From these peripheral locations among others, largely under Syriac and Aramaic
               influence, knowledge of Christian doctrine and practice, along with a considerable
               body of ecclesiastical lore, spread among the tribally organized, Arabic-speaking
               peoples of central Arabia and the Ḥijāz. By the time of the prophet Muḥammad (ca.
               570–632), there was a significant level of awareness of Christianity in its Aramaic
               and Syriac expression, in the environs of Mecca and Yathrib/Medina, of its
               scriptures, traditions, and confessional formulae. The principal evidence for this
               relatively high quotient of awareness of Aramaic and Syriac Christianity in the
               Arabic-speaking milieu of 7th cent. Arabia is the Arabic Qurʾān itself. Scholars
               alternatively trace this awareness to the influence of a local ‘Jewish Christianity’
               (De Blois; Gnilka), or to the actual presence of mainly ‘Jacobite’ and ‘Nestorian’
               Christians in the Qurʾān’s audience, based on the text’s reflection of common
               eschatological and scriptural themes and its critiques of Christian doctrines and
               practices in their Syriac expression, as a growing body of scholarship in recent
               times is increasingly arguing (Andrae; Reynolds; Van der Velden; Griffith 2008).</p>
                    <p>Syriac interaction with Islam thus had its beginnings in the very origins of Islam,
               manifesting itself principally in the Islamic scripture; according to one estimate,
               Syriac loan words in the Arabic Qurʾān account for about seventy percent of the
               foreign vocabulary in the text (Mingana). This state of affairs, along with other
               considerations, has prompted some recent scholars to propose a hitherto unsuspected
               level of influence of the Syriac language even on the grammar and lexicography of
               Qurʾānic Arabic (Luxenberg). Other scholars had already made use of other comparative
               data (Wansbrough) to propose a later, early 8th-cent., Syrian origin for Muḥammad,
               Islam, and the Qurʾān; some have gone so far as to postulate the development of Islam
               at this late date from a supposed heretical, pre-Nicene, Syriac Christianity,
               hitherto unrecognized by earlier Syriac scholars (Ohlig). While these latter
               hypotheses have gained little or no scholarly support for their specific conclusions,
               they nevertheless highlight the continuing importance of Syriac and Syriac studies
               for the scholarly investigation of Islamic origins in Late Antiquity.</p>
                    <p>Syriac writers were among the earliest, non-Muslim witnesses to the Islamic conquest
               and to the appearance of Islam as a new religious tradition. The so-far earliest
               known Christian reference to Muḥammad by name occurs in a Syriac chronicle composed
               around the year 640; the text mentions ‘a battle between the Romans and the Arabs of
               Muḥammad in Palestine twelve miles east of Gaza’ in the year 634 (Hoyland, 120). The
               chroniclers continued to record the interactions between Muslims and Christians well
               up into the Middle Ages, including records of battles, raids, massacres, martyrdoms,
               impositions of taxes, and other matters, including even accounts of the reigns of the
               caliphs and other aspects of Islamic history. These accounts have proven invaluable
               to historians of the early Islamic period, as independent records of events that are
               only sparsely reported or not reported at all in Islamic, Arabic sources of the time
               (Borrut). The great medieval, Syriac chronicles, such as the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> (d. 1199) and the anonymous <ref rend="bold">Chronicle
                  of 1234</ref>, incorporating the narratives of earlier chroniclers (e.g. <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref>), include biographies of Muḥammad and
               accounts of Islamic religious thought, along with reports of the encounters between
               Muslims and Christians. These encounters were often unfriendly and sometimes resulted
               in mass conversions to Islam. For example, a chronicler from the late 8th cent. says
               of the Syriac-speaking Christians in his era, in the region of <ref rend="bold">Ṭur
                  ʿAbdin</ref>, that ‘the gates were opened to them to [enter] Islam. . . . Without
               blows or tortures they slipped towards apostasy in great precipitancy; they formed
               groups of ten or twenty or thirty or a hundred or two hundred or three hundred
               without any sort of compulsion. . . ., going down to <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref> and
               becoming Muslims. A great crowd did so, from the districts of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> and of Ḥarran and of <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref>’ (Harrak,
               324).</p>
                    <p>The earliest religious responses in Syriac to the challenge of Islam seem to have
               been in the apocalyptic genre. The most notable of these is the ‘<ref rend="bold">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</ref>’, in all likelihood composed originally in
               Syriac by a Syr. Orth. writer in ca. 691 (Reinink 1993). The author explains how the
               interlude of Arab domination in time to come, all immediate evidence to the contrary
               notwithstanding, will not really disrupt the unfolding sequence of the four kingdoms
               of the prophecies in the book of Daniel, destined to end with the kingdom of the
               Greeks. Rather, he says, the depredations of the Arabs are part of God’s plan for the
               era of punishment for sin that is destined to usher in the final days of world
               history (Reinink 1992). The Apocalypse was soon translated into Greek and from that
               language was many times translated into other languages of the Christian west
               (Alexander). A number of other apocalyptic texts in Syriac from the same era
               elaborated on the same theme (Drijvers; Suermann). The most important of them was the
               Syriac <ref rend="bold">Sargis Bḥira</ref> legend, soon revised into Arabic, which
               incorporated many of these apocalyptic themes into the story of Muḥammad’s encounter,
               following Islamic sources, with a Christian monk who recognized the sign of prophecy
               on the youthful prophet’s body. The 9th-cent. Syriac author told of the monk’s
               interactions with Muḥammad, including their dialogue about the major topics of
               Christian/Muslim controversy (Roggema). This ingenious narrative, which was destined
               to exert an enormous influence within the Syriac- and Arabic-speaking Christian
               communities of the Near East for centuries to come, incorporated an already popular
               genre in Christian/Muslim relations in Syriac, a literary dialogue between a
               Christian, often a monk, and a Muslim notable, in this instance Muḥammad himself.</p>
                    <p>The earliest of the Syriac, apologetic dialogue texts, like the apocalyptic
               narratives, also come from the early 8th cent. The earliest of them is a letter,
               written in the early 700s and preserved in a manuscript copied in 874, in which a now
               unknown writer tells of the occasion when the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon
                  of the Sedre</ref> (r. 631–648) was interrogated by a Muslim emir, ʿUmayr b. Saʿd
               al-Anṣārī, on Sunday, 9 May 644 (Nau, Penn) — even though this date has been
               questioned in recent research. They discuss the major doctrinal and practical issues
               between Christians and Muslims in such a way that the Christian dialogue partner
               successfully defends his faith, thereby offering the Christian Syriac reader of the
               text the confidence that Christians do have answers to the Islamic religious
               challenge and ways to show the truth of Christianity on the one hand and Islam’s
               shortfall on the other hand. Of the numerous compositions in this genre written in
               Syriac over the centuries, one might mention the most well known among them, works
               such as the account of the monk of Beth Ḥale with a Muslim emir (ca. 720) (Hoyland;
               Griffith 2000), the dialogue between a master and his disciple in Chapter 10 of <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>’s (ca. 792) ‘Scholion’ (Griffith 1981), Patr.
                  <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>’s (d. 823) account of his dialogue with the
               caliph, al-Mahdī, and Muslim scholars in the caliph’s <hi rend="italic">majlis</hi>
               (Mingana; Putnam; Heimgartner), <ref rend="bold">Nonos of Nisibis</ref>’s (d. after
               861) apologetic treatise in Syriac (Van Roey), and <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar
                  Ṣalibi</ref>’s (d. 1171) long refutation of Islam in thirty chapters, distributed
               in three general discourses (Amar). Many anonymous texts of this sort are known in
               the ms. tradition, and a number of them, like Patr. Timotheos’s account of his
               dialogue with the caliph and his attendant scholars, were later translated into
               Arabic and enjoyed a wide circulation in the Christian communities in the Islamic
               world. As a matter of fact, many of the Christian Arabic writers of apologetic texts
               of this sort from the 9th cent. onward were Syriac-speaking Christians who had
               learned Arabic. The most well-known among the earliest of them were the ‘Melkite’
                  <ref rend="bold">Theodoros Abū Qurra</ref> (ca. 755-ca. 830), the ‘Jacobite’ Ḥabīb
               b. Khidma Abū Rāʾiṭa (d. ca. 851), and the ‘Nestorian’ ʿAmmār al-Baṣrī (fl. ca. 850),
               whose apologetic texts in Arabic had a long and wide circulation among Middle Eastern
               Christians (Griffith 2008).</p>
                    <p>An interesting feature of these Christian apologetic texts in both Syriac and Arabic
               is that in them their authors developed an apologetic strategy for commending the
               reasonable credibility of the controversial Christian doctrines that took advantage
               of the modes of reasoning deployed by the contemporary Muslim theologians in the
               early development of an Islamic, systematic theology. In fact, it seems to have been
               the case that the Arabic-speaking, Muslim theologians developed their characteristic
               modes of reasoning in religious matters, the <hi rend="italic">ʿilm al-kalām</hi>,
               very much in the course of their interactions with Syriac-speaking, Christian
               theologians in such intellectual centers as Baṣra and Baghdad in the late 8th and
               early 9th cent. (Cook). One catches a glimpse of the process in the Syriac letters of
               Patr. Timotheos I, who moved his residence from <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> to Baghdad, where he not only participated in a
               well-known debate at the caliph’s court, but where he also engaged in conversations
               with Muslim scholars. He tells about his experiences and recounts his conversations
               in several of his Syriac letters, addressed to a number of Christian correspondents
               (Hurst). In these letters he tells not only of his own experiences in conversation
               with Muslims but in three letters addressed to Christians in the environs of Baṣra he
               offers advice about how to discuss Christology in a Muslim dominated milieu (Griffith
               2007). In these letters one acquires a glimpse into the circumstances of the origins
               not only of Muslim controversial theology, but of a Christian <hi rend="italic">kalām</hi> as well, such as that displayed in the generation after Patr.
               Timotheos, in the Arabic works of ʿAmmār al-Baṣrī, in his interactions with the
               thought of his fellow Baṣrian, the Muʿtazilī, Muslim <hi rend="italic">mutakallim</hi>, Abū Hudhayl al-ʿAllāf (d. ca. 840).</p>
                    <p>In Baghdad from the late 8th to the mid-11th cent. at least, Syriac-speaking,
               Christian intellectuals played a determining role in the multi-faceted intellectual
               undertaking known as the Graeco-Arabic translation movement in early Abbasid times
               (Gutas). Building on the earlier, intellectually important task of translating
               logical, philosophical, and other texts from Greek into Syriac in the context of the
               Christological controversies, especially by scholars in the Syr. Orth. community
               (Hugonnard-Roche), in the 9th and 10th cent. scholars who were mostly alumni of the
               several important schools of the Ch. of E., were engaged by mostly Muslim patrons to
               translate a whole range of texts from Greek into Arabic, embracing not only logical
               and philosophical texts from the Platonic and Aristotelian traditions, but medical,
               mathematical, and other scientific disciplines as well. Important participants in
               this undertaking were members of the Bokhtishoʿ family, with their connections with
               Gondeshapur (<ref rend="bold">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>), the famous <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b.
                  Isḥāq</ref> (808–73), with his family and associates from <ref rend="bold">Ḥirta</ref>, and Abū Bishr Mattā b. Yūnus (d. 940) from the monastery of Dayr
               Qunnā, the community from which many Christian officials at the caliphal court in the
               9th  cent. came originally (Massignon). It is important to see that these Syr.
               Christian intellectuals were not only translators for hire, but important scholars in
               their own right, who participated fully in the scholarly life of Baghdad in their
               time. Abū Bishr Mattā b. Yūnus is a case in point; not only was he one of the two
               Christian teachers of the Muslim philosopher Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī (ca. 870–950), the
               other one being Yuḥannā b. Ḥaylān (d. 910), Abū Bishr was also the champion of ‘Greek
               logic’ among the Christian and Muslim intellectuals of Baghdad. He defended the cause
               in a famous, if for him ill fated, debate between himself and the champion of the
               Muslim <hi rend="italic">mutakallimūn</hi>, Abū Saʾīd al-Sīrāfī, who disdained ‘Greek
               logic’ in favor of the claims of theoretical Arabic grammar as a sufficient measure
               of the soundness of statements made in Arabic (Endress).</p>
                    <p>The most prominent philosopher in the third quarter of the 10th cent. in Baghdad was
               the Syr. Orth. Christian <ref rend="bold">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (893–974), the student of
               al-Fārābī, and in turn the master of a circle of both Muslim and Christian disciples
               who became the mainstays of the Baghdad Aristotelians well into the 11th cent.
               Prominent among them was Yaḥyā’s Syr. Orth. disciple ʿĪsā b. Zurʿa (943–1008), who
               was a notable presence in the learned salons of the social elite of Baghdad in his
               time (Kraemer).</p>
                    <p>An interesting feature of the interaction between Syr. Christian and Muslim scholars
               in the 10th and 11th  cent. is the response made by Christian writers to positions
               taken by prominent Muslims in popular books written in Arabic that enjoyed a wide
               circulation in their time. For example, the Muslim philosopher Yaʿqūb b. Isḥāq
               al-Kindī (ca. 800 – ca. 867), who had been a patron of Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq, wrote a
               widely read essay called ‘The Art of Dispelling Sorrows’ that offered consolation on
               solely philosophical grounds. At least three Christian writers wrote responses to
               this text in Arabic (Griffith 1996), prominent among them being the Ch.  of E.
               prelate <ref rend="bold">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (975–1046), who became famous for his
               discussions about religion with the Muslim vizier Abū al-Qāsim al-Ḥusayn b. ʿAlī
               al-Maghribī (981–1027) (Samir). Similarly, the famous Muslim writer, Abū ʿUthmān ʿAmr
               b. Bahr al-Jāḥiẓ (777–868) had argued in his famous <hi rend="italic">Kitāb
                  al-ḥayawān</hi> that lifelong sexual continence is impossible for humans. Both
               Yaḥyā b. ‘Adī and Eliya of Nisibis wrote treatises on sexual continence expressly to
               refute al-Jāḥiẓ’s claims and to commend the practice of sexual abstinence as an
               important virtue for one seeking moral perfection (Griffith 2006).</p>
                    <p>These and many other instances of the interactions between Syr. Christians and
               Muslims in the heyday of the Abbasid caliphs show clearly that Christians of the
               Syriac-speaking communities played a major role in the growth and development of
               classical Islamic culture in its origins. Their interactions continued into much
               later times. A major case in point is evident in the life and work of the Syr. Orth.
               polymath <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (1225–86). He composed important works in
               both Syriac and Arabic, and in his time he was well known not only among his
               co-religionists, but among Muslim intellectuals as well; he mentions the names and
               takes account of the positions of Muslim writers such as Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī,
               al-Jāḥiẓ, and al-Ghazzālī in his own works. In Syriac, Bar ʿEbroyo often wrote in
               the style current among Arabic-speaking writers of his day. As a matter of course, he
               takes Islamic points of view seriously in his work and in many ways he came the
               closest of all Syriac writers to something like a real dialogue with Islam; in his
               work there is a concern for scholarly objectivity, shown in his quotations from
               Islamic texts, that sets him apart from the earlier writers of dispute texts
               (Takahashi).</p>
                    <p>An important, but controversial area of interaction between Syriac Christianity and
               Islam is religious mysticism. Specifically, the question arises about the influence
               of Christian asceticism and mysticism in its Syr. expression, and especially in its
               E.-Syr. or Ch. of E. tradition, on Sufism in its early, especially Persian stages.
               Scholars have been divided in their opinions, with some pointing to the early
               development of Sufism in the very territories of the Syriac-speaking Christians and
               citing numerous parallels (e.g. Tor Andrae; Blum); others have emphasized the natural
               origins of Islamic mysticism in the Qurʾān and early Islamic tradition (Massignon).
               This is very much an area of Syriac interaction with Islam in which detailed,
               comparative study of texts has yet to be undertaken. Most scholars of Sufism simply
               ignore the Syr. ambience in which many of the early Sufi writers lived.</p>
                    <p>Not long after the ‘Syriac <ref rend="bold">Renaissance</ref>’ of the 12th and 13th
               centuries, when local languages gradually came to dominate both the intellectual and
               even the ecclesiastical and liturgical life of Syriac Christianity, at the expense of
               classical Syriac, interactions between Islam and Syriac Christianity nevertheless
               continued to be an important feature of life for the Christians living in Islamic
               polities. Syriac-speaking communities readily became fluent in the newly dominant
               languages of their homelands, be they Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish, or Persian, and in
               these and other languages, such as those of Central Asia, their interactions with
               Muslims have been continuous and their participation in public life in the Islamic
               milieu, especially in the Arabic-speaking world, has been significant especially in
               the cultural and political spheres. A notable instance of this interaction in modern
               times was the prominent place of Christian intellectuals in the promotion of Arab
               nationalism in the early to middle 20th cent (Hourani).</p>

                    <p>Scribe and bp. for various dioceses. He was born Yuḥanon b. Shahīn b. Shamo of <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>, also nicknamed b. al-ʿAraqjanji ‘son of the maker of <hi rend="italic">ʿarraqiyya</hi> (a small cap worn under a turban to absorb sweat)’.
               His brother, ʿAbd al-Karīm, and he became monks at <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  al-Zaʿfarān</ref> prior to 1716. He spent some time in <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor
                  Matay</ref> between 1727 and 1732. Patr. Shukrallāh consecrated him assistant bp.
               in 1740; he then became bp. of Dayro d-Mor Matay in 1743.</p>
                    <p>Iwannis was sent to serve in Malankara ca. 1746. His bad temper and mismanagement led
               to much trouble. He toured the churches in India damaging sculptures which the
               Portuguese Catholics introduced and forcing priests to wear hats (<hi rend="italic">ʿarraqiyya</hi>s!). Iwannis prohibited many priests who did not follow the Syr.
               Orth. tradition from performing ecclesiastical duties which led to much friction
               between him and the local bp. Thoma V, the legitimacy of whose consecration was
               already under dispute. Both Iwannis and Thoma, however, wrote to the Patr. requesting
               him to send a <ref rend="bold">maphrian</ref> to Malankara. The Patr. sent Maph.
               Shukrallāh of Aleppo who arrived in 1751. When the maph. witnessed Iwannis’s bad
               temper and harsh treatment of priests, he detained him in Cochin and sent him back to
               the Middle East on the next ship. In 1752, Iwannis became the bp. of Badlis. He died
               in 1755 as did his brother, who was a bp.</p>
                    <p>Iwannis was a notable scribe. He produced a number of liturgical mss.</p>

               [Ch. of E. or Syr. Orth.]</ab>
                <div type="body">
                    <p>Natural philosopher, translator, and physician, active in Iraq in the first Abbasid
               cent., nicknamed ‘al-Abrash’, or ‘the Spotted’. The exact dates of his life are not
               known, but scholars estimate that he lived between 760 and 835. He was active in the
               time of the Abbasid caliph al-Maʾmūn (r. 813–33). Both Iyob and his son Ibrāhīm
               worked as physicians in the entourage of the Abbasid family. Iyob was sent by
               al-Maʾmūn to Khurasan to serve as ʿAbd Allāh b. Ṭāhir’s physician, when the latter
               became governor there in the early 830s. It seems unlikely that he would have been
               charged with such a task at the advanced age of 70; his estimated year of birth,
               probably based solely on <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s reference to Iyob
               (Abbeloos and Lamy, <hi rend="italic">Gregorii Barhebraei chronicon
                  ecclesiasticum</hi>, vol. 2, 181) as someone living in the era of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>, is therefore probably too early. In the same
               passage, Bar ʿEbroyo calls Iyob a philosopher ‘who followed the doctrine of
               Nestorius’. Mingana interpreted this as Job having converted from the Melkite or Syr.
               Orth. to the Ch. of E., probably on account of his Edessene origins. However,
               historical references to his conversion are lacking, and the possibility should be
               considered that Bar ʿEbroyo’s claim is based on conjecture. There are no earlier
               sources that refer to his ecclesiastical affiliation, and the only surviving mss. of
               his works were produced in a Syr. Orth. milieu.</p>
                    <p>In his letter to ʿAlī b. Yaḥyā b. al-Munajjim about the translations of <ref rend="bold">Galen</ref>’s work into Arabic, <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d.
               873) mentions Iyob as a translator of 36 of Galen’s works, mostly from Greek into
               Syriac. He probably translated works by <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref> and Ptolemy as
               well. Of his own works only two survive, the most important of which is the ‘Book of
               Treasures’ (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-simātā</hi>). It deals with a wide range of
               natural phenomena which Iyob analyzes according to his theory of the elements. It
               contains six discourses covering a wide-range of disciplines, such as anatomy,
               zoology, psychology, chemistry, metallurgy, meteorology, and astronomy. Iyob presents
               explanations for countless aspects of the natural world, with a distinct etiological
               focus and style that resembles the genre of <hi rend="italic">problemata
               physica</hi>. He begins the work with his theory regarding the four simple and
               abstract essences, i.e. heat, cold, humidity and dryness, which, if found in
               individual compositions, constitute essences of a secondary kind. Iyob employs the
               fact that the primary essences are antagonistic as proof of the existence of God,
               whose act of creation consisted of bringing these elements together by force, as well
               as proof of the gradual disintegration of the world that leads to the end of times.
               The work contains a somewhat covert polemic against Islam, in that it culminates in a
               refutation of those who believe in an afterlife with physical pleasures. It also
               reveals Iyob’s acquaintance with contemporary Muʿtazilī thought. The work contains a
               strong resemblance to the pseudonymous Arabic work ‘The secret of creation’ (<hi rend="italic">Sirr al-khalīqa</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-ʿilal</hi>),
               attributed to Apollonius of Tyana (‘Balinus’), which was possibly written in the time
               of al-Maʾmūn as well, but the relationship between the two has not been thoroughly
               clarified. Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen are directly referenced in Iyob’s work.
               In addition, scholars claim to have found echoes of the Cappadocian Fathers,
               Theophrastus, Proclus, and Nemesius of Emesa. However, an in-depth study into Iyobs’s
               sources remains a desideratum.</p>
                    <p>Besides the ‘Book of Treasures’, only Iyob’s ‘On Rabies’ survives. The two extant
               works contain references to titles of some of his works now lost: ‘On Urine’, ‘On the
               causes of fevers’, ‘On the soul’, ‘On the causes of the coming into existence of the
               universe from the elements’, ‘On the five senses’, ‘On essences’, ‘On Faith’, and
               ‘Ten syllogisms taken from the nature of things, which prove that Christ is both God
               and man’. His work (possibly: works) ‘On Urine’ was known by several Arabic
               scientists in the centuries to follow, suggesting that it existed in Arabic as well,
               but it remains impossible to determine whether Iyob authored works in that language.
               Ullmann (<hi rend="italic">Die Medizin im Islam</hi> [1970], 102) supposes that when
               Abū ʿAbd Allāh al-Khwārizmī, Abū Bakr al-Rāzī and Muṭahhar al-Maqdisī cite Iyob, they
               are making use of Arabic translations of his Syriac works, while for example Kraus,
               Mingana, and Ḥabbī assume that Iyob wrote some of his works in Arabic.</p>

               In 1869, he accompanied his Abbot and Patr. Yawsep Audo to the first Vatican Council,
               and there attended the Propaganda school until 1879. He was ordained a priest in 1879

                    <p>Syriac scholar, professor at the University of Leiden, The Netherlands. After
               defending his Ph.D. dissertation (on the Hebrew text and ancient versions of
               Zechariah, ch. 9–14) in 1949, and spending an additional year of study in Leeds and
               Oxford, Jansma was appointed full professor of ‘Hebrew language and literature,
               Israelite Antiquities, and Aramaic’ at Leiden in 1950. He held this position until
               1973. Although in that year the position was split, leaving to Jansma the
               responsibility for Aramaic only, he soon thereafter had to retire for reasons of
               health. For the last thirty years of his life he did not engage in teaching or
               research.</p>
                    <p>Jansma left a number of important publications, several of which are related to his
               work for the Leiden based edition of the OT <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> (for which
               he prepared Genesis). He edited Syr. fragments of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of
                  Mopsuestia</ref>’s Commentary on Genesis and studied various exegetical homilies
               by <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (as well as
               some anonymous homilies). With an important essay, ‘Investigations into the early
               Syrian Fathers on Genesis’ (1958), he laid the groundwork for a systematic study of
               E.-Syr. exegetical literature. Among his other interests, his work on <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>, on <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>’s ‘Commentary on Gen. and Ex.’,
               and on <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan bar Penkaye</ref> should be singled out.</p>

                    <p>As the birthplace of Christianity and the main destination of pilgrimage, Jerusalem
               played an important role for Christians of all Syr. traditions. At times, however,
               Syr. Christians had a somewhat ambivalent attitude towards the ‘earthly’ Jerusalem,
               to which the idea of the ‘heavenly’ Jerusalem or the eschatological city of Jerusalem
               often was contrasted as a more productive locus of theological or ascetic
               reflection.</p>
                    <p>Along with visitors and pilgrims from all over the Christian world, Syr. Christians
               started visiting Jerusalem or living there for some time no later than the 4th or
               early 5th cent. There is ample evidence of pilgrimages to Jerusalem throughout the
               centuries by both W. and E. Syrians.</p>
                    <p>At the Council of Chalcedon (451) Jerusalem became an independent patriarchate, but
               the Syr. Orth. Church and the Ch. of E., who either rejected or ignored this council,
               continued to see Jerusalem as being under the authority of the patriarchate of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>. Efforts to associate the Christians of Jerusalem with the
               resistance to Chalcedon, in particular in the years when <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref>
               resided as patr. in Antioch (512–518), were largely unsuccessful, and the majority of
               Christians in Jerusalem and Palestine accepted the Council of Chalcedon. The Syr.
               churches, therefore, only had a marginal presence in Jerusalem. Due to their
               non-acceptance of the Council of Chalcedon, Syr. bps. of Jerusalem did not have the
               patriarchal rank, even though in the later period (from the 16th cent. onwards) the
               title of patr. was occasionally used by Syr. Orth. bps. In general, bps. of
               Jerusalem, of both Syr. churches, were metropolitan bps. (even though, with very few
               exceptions, they did not have suffragan bps.).</p>
                    <p>For the Syr. Orth. Church, a list appended to the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael
                  Rabo</ref> (App. IV) provides the names of bps. of Jerusalem. For the period until
               the early 6th cent., the names coincide with those of the bps. of the Imperial
               Church. For the period between ca. 500 and ca. 800 only a few names are preserved,
               and it is unclear whether we are dealing with the formal institution of a Jerusalem
               episcopacy. From the late 8th until the late 12th cent. Michael provides a continuous
               list of 25 Syr. Orth. bps. of Jerusalem, which is generally seen as reliable. For the
               subsequent period, from the 12th cent. until the present day, a list of all known
               bps. is available in Kiraz, 45–7.</p>
                    <p>For the Ch. of E., a metropolitan bp. ‘of Damascus, Jerusalem, and the coastal area’
               is attested from the late 9th cent. onwards. Only a handful of names are known for
               the subsequent period and the institution disappeared in the modern period.</p>
                    <p>Several buildings are associated with the Syr. Orth. presence in Jerusalem: first,
               the Church of Mary Magdalene and Simon the Pharisee, i.e., where the episode
               recounted in Lk. 7:36–50 was situated (near Herod’s Gate; perhaps going back to the
               early 9th cent., later expanded with a monastery, and at the end of the 12th cent.
               converted into the <hi rend="italic">Madrasat al-Qādisiyya</hi>); second, the Church
               of Thomas, near the Armenian Monastery (attested from the 14th cent. onwards; it
               later became divided between the al-Yaʿqubī Mosque and the Anglican Cathedral);
               third, Dayr al-ʿAdas in Zion (which following the assassination of Bp. Gregorios
               Joseph IV in 1537 was turned into a mosque and later, in 1907, was converted into the
               Greek Orthodox Monastery of Nicodemus); and finally, the Church of the Mother of God,
               traditionally regarded as the house of the evangelist Mark, known as the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St. Mark</ref> (which may have come into Syr. Orth.
               possession around 1500) and still in Syr. Orth. possession today. In addition, the
               Syr. Orth. had a presence in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher (attested since the
               12th cent.). Nowadays they use the Chapel of Nicodemus, although the rights are
               somewhat disputed. Syr. Orth. pilgrims left a number of Syr. <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref> at the entrance of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher (see
               Brock, Goldfus, and Kofsky).</p>
                    <p>As for the Ch. of E., in the 16th and 17th cent. there existed a church ‘of the
               Nestorians’ dedicated to St. Mary, situated to the north of the Holy Sepulcher. When
               the E.-Syr. presence in Jerusalem came to an end, in the 18th or possibly in the
               early 19th cent., the ms. collection belonging to this church passed into the hands
               of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate (see Chabot, Rücker, and Brock).</p>
                    <p>Outside of Jerusalem, there is evidence of Syr. Orth. presence in the medieval period
               in Tiberias, and from the 14th cent. onwards in the Church of the Nativity in
               Bethlehem. The presence of monks from the Ch. of E. is attested in a hermitage near
               Jericho (Fiey 1983, and Brock and Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Hidden Pearl</hi>, vol.
               2, 46) and possibly in a monastic complex at Tel Masos, in the northern Negev (Fritz
               and Maiberger).</p>
                    <p>Following the <ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref> a number of Syr. Orth. families settled in
               Jerusalem and Bethlehem, many of whom emigrated out of the area after the 1948 and
               1976 Arab- Israeli wars. Bp. <ref rend="bold">Athanasios Yeshuʿ Samuel</ref> played an
               important role in the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. His autobiographical book on
               this subject contains much information on the Jerusalem community, in particular in
               the second quarter of the 20th cent. The present-day Syr. Orth bp. of Jerusalem has
               the title of ‘Patriarchal vicar of the Holy Land and Jordan’. Similarly, the Syr.
               Cath. and Chaldean Churches are represented in Jerusalem by patriarchal vicars, while
               the Maronite Church has a patriarchal exarch.</p>

                    <p>Monastic founder and author. John was born in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, the child
               of a rhetor and his mother, Aphtonia. He was a monk of the monastery of St. Thomas at
               Seleucia Pieria on the Orontes (near <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>) until he and other
               monks were driven out as a result of imperial persecution of non-Chalcedonian
               monasteries (ca. 530). The group chose John to be their Abbot and founded the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref> on the Euphrates, an establishment that
               came to produce many influential church leaders, scholars, and translators. John is
               remembered as having played a significant role in facilitating the transmission of
               Greek literary culture into a Syriac milieu. He participated in the Miaphysite
               negotiations with Justinian in Constantinople (ca. 531) before he died in 537. John
               wrote a biography of <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref>, and a commentary on the
               Song of Songs, fragments of which survive in catenae. He is credited with having
               written a number of hymns in Greek that were added to collections associated with
               Severus and later translated into Syriac.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Bp. of Constantinople (398–404). Born in <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> in an affluent
               family, John studied under the renowned pagan rhetorician Libanius and was headed for
               a distinguished career in law or civil service until he fell under the influence of
               bp. Meletius. John was baptized in 368 and spent several years as part of an informal
               ascetic brotherhood that included <ref rend="bold">Theodore</ref>, later bp. of
               Mopsuestia, who had been John’s fellow student under Libanius. In 381 Meletius
               ordained John as a deacon and in 386 Bp. Flavian made him a presbyter, at which time
               he became famous in Antioch for his skillful and plain-spoken preaching. Though
               Greek-speaking, from the pulpit he praised the unpretentious faith of the indigenous
               Aramaic-speaking Christians who lived in the countryside around the sophisticated
               Greco-Roman city. In 398 he was called to fill the vacant see of Constantinople. Once
               in the imperial capital, John’s moralistic preaching and strong character won him
               powerful enemies. Bp. Theophilus of Alexandria, who had consecrated John, resented
               the rejection of his own candidate and was jealous of Constantinople’s growing
               prestige. Many of the city’s clergy opposed John’s rigorous reforms. Theodosius’s
               empress Eudoxia was incensed at John’s relentless critique of the wealthy, and of her
               in particular. At the Synod of the Oak (403), Theophilus had John deposed, but
               popular support for John made it necessary to recall him. Nevertheless, he was
               deposed again in 404 and exiled to Cucusus in Armenia. He died on 14 Sept. in 407,
               while en route to the even more remote Pithyus on the Black Sea. In 438 his body was
               translated in great honor to Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>Though the connection between John and the Orthodox eucharistic liturgy bearing his
               name is disputable, he left behind a great many homilies, letters, treatises, and
               extensive cycles of exegetical homilies on scripture. His reputation and writings
               made him immensely popular. His eloquence earned him the posthumous surname
               ‘Chrysostom’ (‘Golden-mouth’); his tendency towards literal interpretation and his
               moralizing (rather than dogmatic) applications ensured that his works would be
               translated from Greek into various languages and circulated widely across
               confessional boundaries. John was being translated into Syriac by the late 5th cent.
               A  number of very early extant Syriac mss. contain portions of his works, primarily
               of W.-Syr. provenance, many of them earlier than extant Greek mss. Excerpts from his
               works appear in numerous W.-Syr. homiliaries, catenae, and other anthologies. His
               influence on the E.-Syr. tradition is obvious from the references in <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>’s ‘Catalogue’ (16; Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>,
               3.1.24–7) and the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref> (1.67), and is also evident
               in the quotations occurring in the commentaries of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of
                  Merv</ref>, the writings of <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ Qaṭraya</ref>, and the vast
               exegetical compilation, <ref rend="bold">Gannat Bussāme</ref>. The oft-repeated
               assertion that <ref rend="bold">Ḥenana</ref> was responsible for bringing John into
               prominence in the E.-Syr. church as an allegorizing competitor to Theodore of
               Mopsuestia is probably unfounded. Whatever Ḥenana’s influence may have been, John
               Chrysostom was a respected resource in the E.-Syr. tradition alongside his friend
               Theodore by the late 6th cent.</p>

                    <p>Greek theologian and poet. After an early administrative career he became a monk of

               better and several of his liturgical canons were soon translated into Syriac, along
               with ones by Cosmas of Jerusalem and other Palestinian poets (cf. ms. Sinai Syr.

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Greek philosopher and lay theologian. A native of Alexandria, he studied under the
               Neoplatonist philosopher Ammonius (of whose works he was an editor). The epithet <hi rend="italic">philoponos</hi>, ‘lover of labour’, was probably given him in view
               of his industriousness. As a philosopher John has been described as one of the most
               original thinkers of his time, notable especially for his criticism of the prevailing
               Aristotelian doctrine of the eternity of the world. His writings prior to ca. 553
               dealt with many different aspects of Aristotelian philosophy and survive only in
               Greek. It seems that it was the Council of Constantinople of 553 that led him to turn
               his attention to theology (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 7260–7274, and Supplement);
               most of this is known only in Syriac translation. This applies in particular to his
               main surviving theological work, the <hi rend="italic">Diaitētēs</hi>, or ‘Arbiter’,
               on the Union (in the incarnate Christ). His <hi rend="italic">Tmemātā</hi>, or
               ‘Sections’ against the Councils of Chalcedon (451) and Constantinople (553) are
               summarized in <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>’s Chronicle (VIII.13). His work on
               the Creation of the World, dating from ca. 557–60, extant in Greek, was written
               against the views of Cosmas Indicopleustes, the friend of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Aba
                  I</ref>. His later theological works are known only in excerpts or from hostile
               sources: this applies in particular to his ‘On the Trinity’, where his rigorous
               application of logic led him to speak of the oneness of the Trinity as an
               abstraction. This position, held by a number of theologians, was condemned as
               tritheism, generating a considerable polemical literature (among which is <ref rend="bold">Peter of Kallinikos</ref>’s work ‘Against Damian’). John’s theological
               teaching was explicitly condemned at the Council of Constantinople in 680, but his
               philosophical works remained influential, first in Arabic translation, and then in
               16th-cent. Western Europe in Latin.</p>

                    <p>Also known as John of Beth Ruphina and John of Maiuma. An anti-Chalcedonian
               presbyter, monk, and hagiographer of the 5th and 6th cent.; dates of birth and death
               unknown. He was probably born in the province of Arabia, and seems to have spent some
               time as a student of law at <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref> before his ordination as
               presbyter in <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> by Peter the Fuller about 475. During the
               confusion that followed upon Emperor Zeno’s expulsion of Peter the Fuller in 477, and
               the appointment of Calandion as new head of the church of Antioch, John found refuge
               in Ascalon where he became a monk under <ref rend="bold">Peter the Iberian</ref>, the
               spiritual leader of the anti-Chalcedonian communities in Palestine. After the death
               of Peter in 491, John was entrusted with the service of the altar in the church of a
               newly built monastery at Maiuma, dedicated to the memory of Peter the Iberian. In the
               title of one of his works (Plerophories), he is styled ‘bishop of Maiuma at
               Gaza’.</p>
                    <p>From John Rufus three works have survived, originally composed in Greek but preserved
               solely in Syriac: the ‘Life of Peter the Iberian’, the ‘Commemoration of the Death of
               Theodosius’, and the ‘Plerophories’. The most important of these works is
               unquestionably the ‘Life of Peter the Iberian’, to which we owe much of our knowledge
               about the first generation of opposition to Chalcedon. The text has been anonymously
               preserved, but in 1912, Eduard Schwartz proved its proper attribution to John Rufus,
               mainly through an evaluation of internal evidences. The narrative, rhetorically and
               stylistically advanced, covers Peter the Iberian’s life from birth to death, but
               draws particular focus on the travels throughout the eastern provinces which Peter
               the Iberian undertook to provide spiritual support to those who refused Chalcedonian
               communion. The much less extensive ‘Commemoration of the Death of Theodosius’,
               written as an appendix to the ‘Life of Peter the Iberian’, deals with the martyrdom
               of Theodosius, the Palestinian monk who seized the Patriarchal throne in <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> from Juvenal immediately after Chalcedon. The
               Plerophories, finally, seems to have been composed during the patriarchate of <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> (512–18) and consists of a collection of
               eighty-nine anecdotes about prophesies, visions, and other signs received by holy men
               against the council of Chalcedon. As a result of its harsh and relentless language
               and imagery, the Plerophories may be considered one of the most aggressive and
               eccentric instances of anti-Chalcedonian polemics.</p>

                    <p>Jewish historian. A Syriac translation of the 6th Book of his ‘Jewish War’, entitled
               ‘On the destruction of Jerusalem’, features under his name at the end of the
               Ambrosian ms. of the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> OT (7a1) as ‘the 5th Book of
               Maccabees’ (f. 320v–330v), since it follows I–IV Maccabees; it is also found in one
               other early Peshitta ms. (8g1). Quotations from other books of the ‘Jewish War’ are
               found especially in the Syriac translation of <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Theophania</hi> and in <ref rend="bold">Sargis the Stylite</ref>’s
               ‘Disputation with a Jew’; their presence in the latter suggests that the whole work

                    <p>Syriac Christianity originated and developed in areas in which communities of
               Diaspora Judaism existed. Throughout their history Syr. Christians lived in proximity
               to Jews, both in the cities of Syria and in North and Central Mesopotamia, and they
               shared with Jews their language and much of their religious worldview. The
               interactions between Syr. Christians and Jews can be studied on three different
               levels: 1. the common religious and cultural heritage, and the influx of ideas from
               Judaism into Syr. Christianity, in particular in the early period; 2. the literary
               representations of Judaism within Syr. Christian literature, which are often of a
               polemical nature; 3. the more occasional and incidental comments on contacts and
               exchanges between Syr. Christians and Jews in daily life. While Jews and Judaism are
               frequently mentioned and discussed in Syr. sources, explicit references to Syr.
               Christians are almost completely lacking from Jewish sources. Whether and to what
               extent certain passages in Rabbinic literature were written in response to arguments
               brought forward by Syr. Christians remains a question of scholarly debate. Evidence
               of Jewish interest in Syr. Christianity is occasionally found in the Middle Ages,
               e.g., when R. Hai Gaon (939–1038) expresses interest in knowing the E.-Syr. Cath.’s
               view on an obscure phrase in Psalms, or when a Jewish redactor rewrites the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> of Proverbs into a Targum (Sokoloff, 404–5; Weitzman,
               109–11). A more considered interest was found in the period of Humanism and
               Enlightenment, e.g., with <ref rend="bold">A. de’ Rossi</ref> and, more sporadically,
               with B. de Spinoza (d. 1677).</p>
                    <p>The eastward spread of Christianity from Palestine must have affected the Jewish
               communities and the Semitic, largely Aramaic speaking, populations of Syria and
               Mesopotamia. Some of the earliest Christian preaching must have been done in Aramaic,
               even though there is very little evidence. At the same time, by the beginning of the
               Christian era, Hellenism and Greco-Roman culture had a strong presence throughout the
               Near East, and Greek soon became the primary language of Christianity. Not
               surprisingly, therefore, there has been an ongoing discussion among scholars as to
               whether the Jewish stream of ideas or the Greco-Roman one was more decisive in the
               birth and early development of Syr. Christianity. There is reason, however, to assume
               that Judaism was a determining factor in the origin and early development of Syr.
               Christianity, based on the fact (1) that Syr. Christians, probably in the late 2nd
               cent., received the OT Peshitta from Judaism (regardless of whether the translation
               from Hebrew was made prior to its being adopted as the Syr. Christian Bible, or was
               made by Syr. Christians with a Jewish background); (2) that early Syr. literature
               occasionally reflects non-biblical phraseology of the Jewish Targumim (e.g., Brock
               1995); (3) and that early Syr. liturgy exhibits features of Jewish origin
               (Rouwhorst).</p>
                    <p>Somewhat related to this is the question of Syr. Christianity’s relationship to
               so-called Jewish Christianity, i.e., forms of Christianity represented by people who,
               mostly of Jewish origin themselves, continued to identify as Jews and remained
               faithful to Jewish customs and rituals (such as circumcision and food laws). As
               evidence for the existence of Jewish Christians in Syria, one may point to the <ref rend="bold">Didascalia Apostolorum</ref> (3rd cent.), which most likely was written
               in Syria and which in some sections clearly reflects a Christian community that was
               composed of both Gentiles and Jews (who had to be discouraged from identifying too
               closely with non-Christian Judaism). This text, however, was written in Greek and may
               not be representative of the situation in the heartlands of Syr. Christianity; on the
               other hand, the text’s reception and popularity in Syriac, most likely from the 5th
               cent. onwards, indicates that its content was seen as relevant to Syr. Christianity.
               The Pseudo-Clementine writings (see <ref rend="bold">Clement of Rome</ref>) also
               reflect Jewish understandings of Christianity (see most recently Reed). Written in
               Greek, probably in the 3rd cent., these texts were translated into Syriac and parts
               were included in the earliest dated Syr. ms. (Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150, dated
               411).</p>
                    <p>Recent scholarship has pointed out that in the early Christian period the boundaries
               between Jewish and Christian communities were far from watertight and allowed for a
               rather fluid pattern of religious identification. This situation of porous borders
               may have lasted longer in Aramaic-speaking areas than in the Greco-Roman world; it
               also may have had a longer history in the Sasanian Empire, where the 4th-cent.
               Christianization of the Roman Empire had little immediate effect (Becker 2003). In
               such a situation the interrelationship between Jews and Christians may have been more
               complex than it was in the Christianized Roman Empire.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of how strong a presence Jewish Christianity had in the early period, Syr.
               Christianity from the 4th cent. onwards saw itself as breaking away from Judaism. The
               two main 4th-cent. authors, <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, convey mixed messages. On the one hand, a number of themes and
               ideas of Jewish origin are found in their works and suppose an audience that, at
               least in part, was well acquainted with Judaism. On the other hand, this common
               ground with Judaism did not prevent these authors from expressing distance from and
               rejection of Judaism, including contemporary Judaism. Just as in Greek Christian
               literature, Judaism was defined increasingly as the opposite of Christianity. The
               writings of Aphrahaṭ and Ephrem may be read perhaps as reflecting a situation which
               was still characterized by ongoing communality between Jews and Christians, but in
               which these very authors were intent on drawing clearer boundaries and creating
               separation. Anti-Jewish sentiment, which had been largely absent from early Syr.
               literature, became a factor in the process of Christian self-identification. It may
               also be telling that it is mainly Aphrahaṭ’s second series of Demonstrations
               (nos.  11–22), dated to 344, that contains anti-Jewish polemic, while the earlier
               series (Dem. 1–10, dated to 337) is relatively free from it. In 344, well into the
               Roman-Persian war and the predicament of persecution, Christians may have needed a
               more powerful warning that they should not choose the easy solution of retreating to
               the relative safety of Judaism.</p>
                    <p>Aphrahaṭ and Ephrem, writing in the Persian-Sasanian Empire and in the Roman Empire
               respectively, share a number of themes and arguments in their dealings with Judaism,
               but their tone is very different. To account for Ephrem’s harsh language about Jews
               (which may have targeted Judaizing Christians rather than Jews themselves), scholars
               have pointed to Ephrem’s and his community’s own profound Jewishness (Cassingena:
               ‘«judéité» fondatrice’), which would have contributed to Ephrem’s particular
               sensitivity. But the general profile of Aphrahaṭ’s community cannot have been much
               different, and yet his approach is so much milder. Should we ascribe the difference
               between Aphrahaṭ and Ephrem to ‘personal temperament and inclination’ (Hayman 1985,
               427)? Or should the social and political context be taken into consideration? In the
               Persian-Sasanian Empire, in which Aphrahaṭ wrote, both Judaism and Christianity were
               minorities in the Zoroastrian society. In the Roman Empire, however, Syr.
               Christianity soon became part of the emerging imperial orthodoxy, which in Ephrem’s
               day was in the process of asserting itself, although it still was fragile (as the
               short reign of Emperor Julian showed) and weakened by internal division. Might this
               difference have contributed to setting a different tone for Aphrahaṭ, on the one
               hand, and for Ephrem, on the other? But even within the corpus of Ephrem’s writings
               the degree of anti-Jewish polemic differs widely: the Commentary on Genesis (a work
               with many ‘Jewish’ features) and the Prose Refutations (dealing with different
               ‘heretical’ doctrines) have very little anti-Jewish polemic; the anti-Judaism of the
               Commentary on the Diatessaron reflects the language of theological debate (Morrison);
               and some of the Hymns are passionately anti-Jewish.</p>
                    <p>Anti-Jewish literature continued in Syr. Christianity, without ever becoming as
               prominent as it was in Greek or Latin Christianity. And again, marked differences are
               found, such as between <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>’s harshness and his
               contemporary <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>’s mildness (Frishman). Here again, one
               author is writing within the Roman Empire and the other as a member of a minority
               group in the Persian-Sasanian Empire. In addition, these authors belong to different
               theological traditions, which may have had a different impact on their approach to
               Judaism. As dyophysite Christology and Antiochene biblical interpretation were often
               portrayed by opponents as being (nearly) identical to Judaism, the use of anti-Jewish
               argument may have become, for those of the Antiochene tradition, less attractive.</p>
                    <p>From the mid-8th cent., when both Jews and Syr. Christians had become minority groups
               under the dominance of Islam, a report is preserved of a disputation that was held in
               the region of <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref>between <ref rend="bold">Sargis the
                  Stylite</ref> (it is unclear whether he was a Miaphysite or a Chalcedonian) and a
               Jew (ed. Hayman). While the text contains a number of stock arguments of anti-Jewish
               polemic, there also is a remarkable passage in which the Jewish interlocutor mentions
               those Christians ‘who associate with us in the synagogue, and who bring offerings and
               alms and oil, and at the time of the Passover send unleavened bread …’ (22.1, ed.
               Hayman, 72; transl. 73–74). Sargis is unable to challenge this description, but
               portrays these people as ‘sick and weak’, not able to walk on the king’s highway.
               Once again we seem to be confronted with porous borders, which allow for multiple
               religious identifications.</p>
                    <p>In addition to occasionally targeting the Jews in their theological polemic, Syr.
               Christians also had a genuine interest in Judaism. Their main source for
               post-biblical Jewish history was <ref rend="bold">Josephus</ref>’s ‘Jewish War’. While
               a Syr. translation is preserved only of the Sixth Book, quotations from other books
               in Sargis the Stylite’s ‘Disputation’ and elsewhere (in a Miaphysite florilegium,
               possibly of the 6th cent., preserved in ms. Dayr al-Suryān 28, and in <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>’s Treatise against the Jews) suggest that a full
               translation once existed. This work was used for purposes well beyond that of
               polemic. <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> had a keen interest in Jewish
               writings, such as the ‘Book of Enoch’ and ‘Jewish Histories’ (<hi rend="italic">tašʿyātā yudāyātā</hi>, a work related to ‘Jubilees’), whose authenticity and
               usefulness he defended, even against more negative views in the earlier tradition
               (Adler). He was also familiar with certain Jewish traditions, such as the
               pronunciation and writing of the Tetragrammaton, and he was aware of the importance
               of the Hebrew language, of which he had some, albeit rather limited knowledge (see
               Salvesen). Cath. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref> as well relied on Jews, who in some
               cases were converts, for information about the Bible. A common practice in biblical
               commentaries is the quotation of alternative readings from the ‘Hebrew (Bible)’
               (along with those from the Septuagint), which either agree with the Masoretic text
               or, more often, reflect later Jewish interpretations (see, e.g., Ter Haar Romeny
               2001). Interest in Jewish sects is found in several Syr. authors, the latest of whom
               is Dionysios bar Ṣalibi (Brock 1977). In his ‘Treatise against the Jews’, probably
               the last such work to be written in Syriac, he included an overview of Jewish sects,
               largely based on <ref rend="bold">Epiphanius of Salamis</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Anakephalaiosis</hi>, expanded with information taken from Josephus’ ‘Jewish War’
               (Book II,160–6). <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s attitude towards Judaism is
               largely irenic. While until recently it was assumed that he was of Jewish descent
               (‘Son of the Hebrew’, his father being the physician Ahrun), most scholars have now
               abandoned this view, linking his name instead to the village of ʿEbro, on the
               Euphrates. There is very little evidence of conversion from Judaism to Syr.
               Christianity in the Islamic period and, more generally, contacts between Jews and
               Christians are very poorly documented. Canonical collections include rules urging
               Christians to work on the Jewish Sabbath, prohibiting bishops and clergy from
               celebrating Jewish festivals, and warning Christians not to accept unleavened bread
               from Jews (Kawerau 94). Here again we may be dealing with attempts by the church
               leadership to create a separation that did not always exist in daily life.</p>
                    <p>For the later period, we have an interesting example of the co-existence of Jews and
               E.-Syr. Christians in Iraqi Kurdistan. From the early 17th cent. onwards,
               benefitting from improved living conditions, both Jews and Christians started
               writing down their vernacular Neo-Aramaic languages, which were closely related and
               mutually understandable. Borrowing the script from their respective authoritative
               traditions (Hebrew and Jewish Aramaic for the Jews and Syriac for the Christians),
               they proceeded in very similar ways, turning in the first place to liturgical or
               para-liturgical texts. This ‘areal phenomenon’, involving both Jewish and Christian
               communities (A. Mengozzi, <hi rend="italic">Israel of Alqosh and Joseph of
                  Telkepe</hi> [CSCO 590; 2002], 16), seems to presuppose a rather unproblematic
               relationship between the two religious communities. As a matter of fact,
               Aramaic-speaking Jews and Christians lived together peacefully in Iraqi Kurdistan
               until around 1950, and in Iran even later. Among the villages and towns in which Jews
               and Christians lived in close proximity to each other, the following deserve to be
               singled out: <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref>, where Jews and Christians went on
               pilgrimage to the tomb of the prophet Nahum (Fiey, <hi rend="italic">Assyrie
                  chrétienne</hi>, vol. 2, 396–400); Zakho (see most recently A. Sabar, <hi rend="italic">My father’s paradise</hi> [2009]); and Shosh (ancient Bashosh; see
               Fiey, <hi rend="italic">Assyrie chrétienne</hi>, vol. 1, 259). An E.-Syr. ms., Brit.
               Libr. Add. 25,875, dated 1709/10 (Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi>, vol. 3,
               1064–69) contains a Hebrew alphabet and some additional writing in Hebrew, including
               a part of Ps. 22 in Hebrew script, even though the text is Syriac. In the 20th cent.,
               however, the political situation in the Middle East added a new layer of tension to
               the relationship between Jews and Syr. Christians.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Bp., theologian, controversialist. In 511 Julian, bp. of Halicarnassus, sided with
                  <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref>, future bp. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, to
               successfully depose Patr. Macedonius of Constantinople. Seven years later, due to the
               anti-Miaphysite policies of the emperor Justinian, Julian and Severus were both
               exiles in Egypt. Here Julian offended Severus by claiming that his belief in the
               incorruptibility of Christ’s body was inspired by Severus’s own work, the
               Philalethes. The resulting epistolary exchange between these former allies soon
               escalated into multiple polemical tractates and finally a significant schism among
               the Miaphysites that lasted for centuries.</p>
                    <p>Julian’s three letters to Severus as well as nearly all of Severus’s anti-Julian
               writings are extant in a Syriac translation that <ref rend="bold">Pawlos of
                  Kallinikos</ref> made in 528. We also possess 154 fragments attributed to Julian,
               also preserved mostly in Syriac. Although these works shed little light on Julian’s
               life, they do allow us to reconstruct much of his theology.</p>
                    <p>Central to Julian and Severus’s dispute was the question of how to properly
               characterize Christ’s body. Although both agreed that after the resurrection Christ’s
               body was incorruptible, Julian declared Christ’s pre-resurrection body to be
               uncorrupted (<hi rend="italic">aphthartos</hi>) as well. According to Julian, unlike
               the post-lapsian human body, Christ’s body would not naturally undergo changes such
               as sleep or death. It was only through Christ’s will that he voluntarily subjected
               himself to human suffering. For Julian this both reinforced Christ’s single nature
               and, by distinguishing Christ’s body from human bodies, assured that Christ was
               immune from the transmission of sin. Severus argued that if Christ had not
               participated fully in human nature, he could not have saved humanity. Severus thus
               saw Julian’s theology as a direct challenge to Christ’s role in salvation, and he
               characterized Julian as a follower of <ref rend="bold">Eutyches</ref>, Mani, and the
               early docetists, calling his theology ‘aphthartodocetism’.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the 520s Julian and Severus no longer wrote treatises against each
               other, but by this time there already was a substantial Miaphysite rift between pro-
               and anti-Julianists. The Alexandrian Patr. Timothy  IV seems to have had
               pro-Julianist leanings, and after his death the pro-Julianist Gaianus was Patr. for
               three months. Although Justinian soon replaced him with the Severian <ref rend="bold">Theodosius</ref>, Gaianus continued to enjoy popular support. Throughout much of
               6th-cent. Egypt there were competing Severian and Julianist/Gaianite hierarchies and
               occasionally dual Patrs. The controversy soon spread outside of Egypt into Syria and
               Asia Minor and in 564 or 565 Justinian himself wrote an edict on the incorruptibility
               of Christ’s body. 7th- and 8th-cent. sources continue to attest to Julianists
               throughout the East. Of particular note is the aphrthartodocetic leanings of <ref rend="bold">Armenian Christianity</ref>. A case for Julian’s influence on Armenian
               christology is difficult to substantiate, however, as none of Julian’s works are
               extant in Armenian. Unfortunately, most of the later anti-Julianist writings remain
               unedited and there has been relatively little work done on the development of this
               movement and its eventual demise.</p>

                    <p>The so-called Julian Romance is a Syriac polemical work against the Roman emperor
               Julian. The principal witness to this text is ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,641,
               which can be dated paleographically to the 6th cent. (with the exception of 23 folios
               that are from the 10th–12th  cent.). Approximately twelve folios are missing from the
               beginning of this ms. The initial section of the narrative is, however, partially
               preserved as the lower writing in the palimpsest ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 378. An
               abridged Arabic translation is also found in ms. Arabic 516 at the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref> with two additional leaves in the Mingana
               collection. In 1880, Hoffmann published the Syriac text of the Julian Romance
               according to the British Library ms. Excerpts were also published by Bedjan
               (independent of Hoffmann) and Gottheil (dependent on Hoffmann). The only complete
               translation of the text is the rather infelicitous one by Gollancz into English, of
               which an abridgment into French was made by Richer.</p>
                    <p>The Julian Romance consists of three parts. The first, which is incomplete, recounts
               Julian’s accession to the throne after Constantine and the resulting persecution of
               the Christians. The second is a narrative about Eusebius, the bp. of Rome, who facing
               persecution opposed Julian. The third and longest section is framed as a letter by
               Aploris to Abdil that describes the reign of Jovian (Syriac <hi rend="italic">ywbnynws</hi>‘Jovinian’). In 1874, Nöldeke argued that all three parts of the
               Julian Romance were composed by the same unknown author. He also contended that the
               Romance was an original Syriac composition written in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>
               between 502–532. Nöldeke’s position was adopted in the standard handbooks, such as
               Baumstark’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der syrischen Literatur</hi> and Ortiz de
               Urbina’s <hi rend="italic">Patrologia Syriaca</hi>, and continues to be favored by
               some scholars today, such as Papoutsakis. There are, however, several other views.
               Van Esbroeck proposed that the Romance was originally written in Greek sometime after
               363 and was then translated into Syriac at the beginning of the 6th cent. H. J. W.
               Drijvers, on the other hand, argued that the Romance is a propaganda tract originally
               written in Syriac in Edessa shortly after 379. Finally, both Brock and Contini have
               more recently suggested that the Romance was written in Edessa, but in the 5th cent.,
               not the 6th.</p>
                    <p>The Julian Romance draws significantly on the ideas and phraseology of <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> and also shares stylistic similarities with the writings of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>. Despite the fact that it is primarily known from
               a single Syriac ms., it has influenced a number of later writings. In the Syriac
               tradition, for instance, the Romance was a source for apocalyptic literature, such as
               the <ref rend="bold">Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius</ref>
                        <hi rend="italic">.
               </hi>Furthermore, the Julian Romance in its Arabic manifestation informed accounts of
               Julian by Arabic historians, such as al-Ṭabarī. It also exerted some influence on
               both Greek and Georgian literature.</p>
                    <p>Finally, mention should be made of a ‘second’ Julian Romance that is preserved in ms.
               London, Brit. Libr. Rich Add. 7192, which can be dated paleographically to the 7th or
               8th cent. This text was also published by Hoffmann (1880, 242–50) and was translated
               into German by Nöldeke (1874, 660–74) and into English by Gollancz (1928, 256–64),
               the latter of which was abridged by Richer (1978, 263–8). This ‘second’ Julian
               Romance, which is much shorter than the ‘first’, describes the apostasy of Julian and
               his magic practices. Based on stylistic differences with the ‘first’ Julian Romance,
               Nöldeke argued that the ‘second’ Julian Romance was most likely written by a
               different author later in the 6th cent. More recently, Muraviev has argued that it is
               actually part of the original Julian Romance belonging to the missing initial
               section.</p>

                    <p>Juridical texts transmitted within the Syr. Christian traditions are of very diverse
               content and nature. In addition to texts dealing with canon law, church
               administration, and discipline, a number of texts deal with private law and secular
               matters. The reason for the latter concern is that the churches in both the
               Zoroastrian and Islamic societies were in charge of private law, and, therefore,
               created handbooks and reference works, particularly in the fields of matrimonial and
               hereditary law. The earliest layer of juridical literature consists of translations
               from Greek; indigenous Syriac material was subsequently added to this in both the W.-
               and E.-Syr. traditions.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">1. Late Roman Law in Syriac Tradition</label>
                    <p>The Syro-Roman Lawbook (ed. Selb and Kaufhold) is a collection of interpretations of
               mostly 5th-cent. imperial constitutions dealing with civil law. It probably
               originated in a law school in Syria, even though the Lawbook’s relationship to the
               academic teaching of law in the schools of <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref> and
               Constantinople has been questioned (Goria). We may be dealing with a 6th-cent. Syr.
               translation of a Greek Vorlage that no longer exists. The Syro-Roman Lawbook,
               therefore, is of crucial importance both for the study of late ancient Roman law and
               for its reception within the Syr. Christian milieu. The work underwent several
               revisions and found its way into W.-Syr. juridical collections from the 8th or 9th
               cent. onwards. It also became known in the Ch. of the E. no later than ca. 800 (Cath.
                  <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref> being our earliest witness). Later Arabic and
               Armenian versions are based on the Syr.</p>
                    <p>A much smaller collection, named by its editor (Selb) ‘Sententiae Syriacae’, reflects
               a similar late Roman imperial context and the practice of a law school. Here again
               the Greek Vorlage is no longer extant.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">2. Civil Law</label>
                    <p>Matrimonial law and hereditary law take an important place in a number of early
               E.-Syr. lawbooks, attributed to cath. Mar <ref rend="bold">Aba I</ref> (d. 552), to
                  <ref rend="bold">Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir</ref> (probably 7th cent.), and to <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿbokht of Rev Ardashir</ref> (late 8th cent.?). These lawbooks
               reflect a Persian Zoroastrian context; the latter two were originally written in
               Persian and subsequently translated into Syriac. E.-Syr. works from the early Islamic
               period include the juridical decisions of cath. <ref rend="bold">Ḥenanishoʿ I</ref>
               (late 7th cent.), and short lawbooks by cath. Timotheos I (d. 823), <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (d. 828), <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</ref> (early
               9th cent.), and <ref rend="bold">Gewargis of Arbela</ref> (late 10th cent.).
               Specifically aimed at collecting and preserving earlier materials are works
               attributed to Cath. <ref rend="bold">Eliya I</ref> (d. 1049) and to <ref rend="bold">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (bar Shinaya, d. 1046). While the lawbooks of Aba  I,
               Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir, Ishoʿbokht, Ḥenanishoʿ I, Timotheos I, and Ishoʿ bar Nun are
               included in E. Sachau’s <hi rend="italic">Syrische Rechtsbücher</hi> (1907–14), and
               the one by ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz was edited by W. Selb (1970), the lawbooks of
               Gewargis of Arbela and cath. Eliya I, both contained in the large collection of E.
               Syr. juridical texts (see <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>), remain
               unpublished. Eliya of Nisibis’s lawbook only exists in Arabic. A remarkable juridical
               collection, known as ‘Syriac texts on Islamic Law’ (ed. Kaufhold 1971), fully
               incorporates Islamic law. It exists in the E. and W.-Syr. tradition as well as in an
               Arabic translation. While it is sometimes attributed to cath. <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan
                  bar Abgare</ref> (ca. 900), its authorship remains uncertain.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">3. Ecclesiastical Law</label>
                    <p>The common foundation of the tradition of ecclesiastical law in all Syrian (and other
               Eastern Christian) churches has two major components, both originally written in
               Greek. The first is the ‘Corpus canonum’, i.e., a collection of canons of the
               4th-cent. councils, including the ecumenical councils of Nicea (325) and
               Constantinople (381) along with a number of local synods (Ancyra, Neocaesarea,
               Gangra, <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, and Laodicea). The second consists of several
               collections of canons attributed to the apostles or their immediate successors. This
               common foundation was expanded with other texts, some of Greek, others of Syriac
               origin.</p>
                    <p>In the W.-Syr. tradition, the ‘Corpus canonum’ (the earliest Syr. translation of
               which was produced in Mabbug in 501/2) gradually underwent a number of expansions.
               These included: one or two of the 5th-cent. councils; some apostolic texts (such as
               the ‘Apostolic canons’, an extract from Book 8 of the ‘Apostolic constitutions’);
               some texts of Miaphysite origin (probably translated from Greek); and indigenous
               Syriac rules by such authors as <ref rend="bold">Rabbula of Edessa</ref>and <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Tella</ref>(bar Qursos). This corpus was revised and further
               expanded by <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>. Around this period, in all
               likelihood, the ‘<ref rend="bold">Didascalia Apostolorum</ref>’ began to appear in the
               juridical collections. One particular ms. (Dam. 8/11), belonging to a slightly later
               period (dated 1204), incorporates a number of further additions, esp. the canons
               (mostly of disciplinary content) of seven Syr. Orth. synods held between 785 and 896
               (ed. of the entire ms. Vööbus 1975–76). This tradition of ecclesiastical law
               eventually merged with civil law in <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s ‘Nomocanon’
               (see sub 4).</p>
                    <p>In the E.-Syr. tradition, the acts and canons of synods between 410 and 776 are
               preserved in the Synodicon Orientale (ed. Chabot). The canons of two additional
               synods (790 and 1318) are preserved as well. The canons of the 4th-cent. Greek
               councils became known to the E. Syr. in the early 5th cent., as is reflected in the
               Synodicon Orientale. The existing canons attributed to the Council of Nicea (325),
               however, appear to be a later collection of 73 (pseudo-Nicene) canons (ed. Vööbus
               1982; GT in Braun 1898). The ‘Apostolic canons’ are included in the E.-Syr. tradition
               as well. Our main source for the E. Syr. juridical tradition is a large collection of
               texts that probably was constituted in the 13th cent. (see Synodicon Orientale); not
               unlike Bar ʿEbroyo’s ‘Nomocanon’ this included both ecclesiastical law and civil law.
               But whereas Bar ʿEbroyo’s editorial work introduced an important unifying dimension
               to the work, no such deliberate policy of unification and classification seems to
               underlie the E.-Syr. collection (Kaufhold 2005, 231).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">4. Systematic Collections</label>
                    <p>Systematic collections in which civil law and ecclesiastical law are deliberately
               brought together can be traced back to a much earlier period than the 13th cent. Such
               works have sometimes been called ‘Nomocanones’ (reflecting the title of somewhat
               similar Greek collections containing secular <hi rend="italic">nomoi</hi>‘laws’ and
               ecclesiastical ‘canons’). The earliest collection of this comprehensive type is the
               one that is (partly) preserved under the name of <ref rend="bold">Gabriel of Baṣra
               </ref>(late 9th cent.). In the E.-Syr. tradition two further systematic collections
               of this type are preserved, both by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>: his
               ‘Nomocanon’ (<hi rend="italic">Kunnāšā d-qānone sunhādiqāye</hi>, ed. A. Mai) and his
               ‘Ordo iudiciorum’ (<hi rend="italic">Tukkās dine ʿedtānāye</hi>, LT by J. M. Vosté;
               for both works, see Kaufhold 2005, 231–5). In the W.-Syr. tradition, Bar ʿEbroyo’s
               ‘Nomocanon’ (<hi rend="italic">Kthobo d-hudoye</hi> ‘Book of directions’, ed. P.
               Bedjan) belongs to the same genre. Chapters 1–8 contain ecclesiastical law (also
               including matrimonial law); chapters 9–40 deal with civil law (Kaufhold 2005,
               219–20). Syriac ‘Nomocanons’ are reflected in some of the Arabic collections, such as
                  <ref rend="bold">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Fiqh
               al-Naṣrāniyya</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The large collections in which the E-. and W.-Syr. juridical traditions reached their
               fullest development, those of ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha and Bar ʿEbroyo, have remained
               authoritative to the present day, in the Ch. of E. and in the Syr. Orth. Church
               respectively (Kaufhold 2005, 220–21 and 235; 2007, 242–3 and 247).</p>

                    <p>Greek Orthodox monastery in Lebanon, known as Dayr Saydat Kaftun (Monastery of Our
               Lady of Kaftun) and located in the valley of the Nahr al-Jaouz near Kaftun, to the
               south of <ref rend="bold">Amyūn</ref>. The modern building is erected on ancient
               substructures to the north of the Church of Sts. Sergius and Bacchus. Reconstruction
               in 2003 resulted in the discovery of wall paintings. These have been restored by the
               Polish Center for Mediterranean Archaeology in Cairo in collaboration with the
               Lebanese Direction Générale des Antiquités.</p>
                    <p>The basilical church consists of a nave with an apse and two aisles. The sidewalls of
               the nave are broken up by two huge arches resting on piers. Later additions include a
               vestibule, a porch, and a barrel vault. The preserved paintings have been attributed
               to two artists working side by side, very likely in the 2nd or 3rd quarter of the
               13th cent. The first master decorated the north and south walls with the Communion of
               the Apostles, divided into two separate scenes. On the north wall survive the bust of
               an archangel in a medallion, a Greek inscription near a now vanished saint
               (Domatius?), and St. Lawrence with an angel. Above this zone, fragments indicate that
               the walls were originally considerably higher. The second artist painted the Deisis
               Vision in the conch of the apse, the Annunciation on the triumphal arch, Sts.
               Bacchus, Sergius, George, and Theodore on the soffits of the westernmost arches, and
               four monastic saints on the soffits of the easternmost arches, among whom are Sts.
               Arsenius and Saba. Stylistically, the first master worked in the Byzantine tradition;
               the style of the second betrays a combination of Syrian, Byzantine, and Cypriot
               influences. The names of the saints are written in either Greek or Syriac. A
               red-bordered white frieze runs over the present upper zone, bearing a now fragmented
               Arabic inscription running over all walls. Part of it can be translated as:
               ‘[Anta]kya and the entire East’, suggesting that the text perhaps included the name
               of the Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> of that time, though this title was
               shared by the leaders of the Byz. Orth., the Syr. Orth., and the Maronite
               churches.</p>
                    <p>The stylistic characteristics of the paintings are echoed in a contemporary
               double-sided icon kept in the chapel of the monastery, showing the Virgin holding the
               Child (obverse) and the Baptism of Christ (reverse). Iconographic and stylistic
               analogies with several icons in the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref>
               on Mount Sinai show that these pieces, too, can be attributed to the same workshop
               or, more precisely, to the second master. The most important piece is a bilateral
               icon representing the Virgin with the Child (obverse) and St. Sergius as a
               banner-carrier with St. Bacchus (reverse), which until recently was considered a
               Crusader work of art.</p>
                    <p>Dayr Kaftun is mentioned in a note in a Maronite ms. dated 1140/41 (A.G. 1452). In a
               much discussed note added on f. 6v of the <ref rend="bold">Rabbula Gospels</ref>, the
               Maronite Patr. Jeremiah of Dmalsa, mentions that in Febr. 1279 (A.G. 1590), he was
               consecrated as bp. of the ‘Holy Monastery of Kaftun constructed on the bank of the
               river’, where he subsequently stayed for four years, before he became Patr. (Borbone,
               39–40 for the text; and 56–8 for a discussion of the chronological problems
               involved). Confusingly, the monastery is also referred to in two Melkite Syriac
               texts. A ms. from 1248 (A.G. 1559) mentions the ‘Monastery of the Mother of God near
               the River of Kaftun’. The monk Gerasimus b. Simaʿan, originating from al-Rummana near
                  <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>, repeats this formulation in his writing from
               1283/84 (A.G. 1595), which also furnishes the name of Aba Simaʿan b. Jaqir (bp.
               Simeon son of Jaqir), ‘the first superior of this holy monastery’. In later sources,
               the monastery features only as a Melkite retreat.</p>

            names of the two protagonists), has enjoyed enormous popularity in the Middle East and
            subsequently in Western Europe, translated into many different languages.<note/>

                    <p>The collection of animal and other stories, generally known under this title (the
               names of the two protagonists), has enjoyed enormous popularity in the Middle East
               and subsequently in Western Europe, translated into many different languages. The
               tales are of Indian origin, and some, derived from a lost Sanskrit original, are to
               be found in the Pancatantra. In the 6th cent. a translation into Middle Persian was
               made by Burzoy (Barzaway), a physician at the court of Khusrau I (531–79); this no
               longer survives, but it was soon translated into Syriac by Bodh, whose translation
               (edited first by G. Bickell, 1876) is the earliest witness to the cycle of stories in
               the Middle East. Later on, in the first half of the 9th cent. the Middle Persian text
               was translated into Arabic by Ibn al-Muqaffaʿ; this too is lost in its original form,
               but it was the ancestor of all the subsequent forms of the collection, whether in
               Arabic or in later translations into Syriac, Persian, Greek, Hebrew, and Spanish;
               from these, yet further translations were made into Western European languages
               (sometimes under the name ‘Bidpay’ or ‘Pilpay’), as well as into Turkish. Ibn
               al-Muqaffaʿ’s translation included an autobiography by Burzoy, and an account of his
               journey to India, sent by Khusrau I. The autobiography is absent from the 6th-cent.
               Syriac translation, but is to be found at the end of the later Syriac version, made
               from Arabic; this was perhaps produced in the 10th or 11th cent., by which time the
               text had been considerably expanded: whereas the older Syriac text contains 10
               stories, the later one has 14. A second Syriac translation based on the Arabic was
               made in the 19th century by the great scholar <ref rend="bold">Toma Audo</ref>; this
               has 15 stories, and lacks the narrative of Burzoy.</p>

               not earlier. During this period, the E.-Syr. Patr. Denḥa II resided in Karamlish for
               a few years, and it was the home of several emirs working for the Mongols, as
               mentioned in the Ecclesiastical History of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>. At that
               time, Karamlish was inhabited by E.-Syr., Syr. Orth., and Armenian families in
               sizable numbers. During the 18th cent., it suffered the onslaught of the army of the
               Persian Nādir Shāh on his way to invade Mosul. Its churches were badly destroyed and
               the inscriptions found there commemorate their rebuilding after 1743. During the 19th
               cent., Karamlish joined the uniate movement, becoming Chald. The community speaks
                  <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref> and owns four churches dedicated to St. Barbara, St.
               George, the Virgin Mary, and St. Addai.</p>

               Sometimes the toponym is abbreviated into Karka ‘Fortress’ or Beth Slokh ‘House of
               Seleucus’. These various forms refer to a major city in <ref rend="bold">Beth

               called locally Karkūk, deriving from Kark Slokh.</p>
                    <p>The city was an E.-Syr. bishopric seat when Shahr-gird served as the seat of the
               province’s Metr. as early as the 3rd cent., and its first three bishops suffered
               martyrdom at the hands of Shapur II (309–379). Kark Slokh became in turn a
               Metropolitan seat as of 410 but in 831/2 the seat was moved to Shahrzur. The city
               became Chald. between 1767 and 1780, serving as a bishopric and then archbishopric
               seat from 1863 to this day.</p>

               Ruins near the present agglomeration mark the site of an abandoned village with a
               small church known as the Chapel of Saydat Kharāʾib (Our Lady of the Ruins). A fire
               caused the half-dome of the apse to be covered with a layer of soot, hiding a
               depiction of the Deisis Vision. The nave’s fragmented decoration consists of a
               tonsured St. Domatius on the north wall, and a fragmented Nativity scene opposite
               him. The estimated date of these murals is the first half of the 13th cent.</p>

                    <p>Various collections of <hi rend="italic">ʿonyāthā</hi> (sing. ʿ
                        <ref rend="bold">onithā</ref>) attributed to Khamis are preserved in mss.
               from the 14th to the 19th cent., often in combination with <hi rend="italic">ʿonyāthā</hi> attributed to Gewargis Warda or other hymnographers. They are
               penitential hymns, hymns for various feasts of the liturgical year, and
               martyrological hymns in praise of Ishoʿsabran (see <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III
                  </ref>of <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref>). Some collections contain poems on rather
               profane themes: satire on the ignorance of the people in Arbela, polemical attack on
               an apostate deacon, allegorical and pedagogical matters (e.g. on the silk-worm, <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> of the letters of the alphabet), and more than two
               hundred epigrams (<hi rend="italic">tarʿe d-mušḥāthā</hi>) on various subjects
               (religion, wisdom, love, every-day objects, and flowers). The latter were much
               appreciated by Baumstark who presented them as most vivid examples of the poetic

               works by ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha belonging to the same genre, which has a liturgical
               function comparable to that of the Latin sequence. The attribution to Khamis of a
               number of religious or profane <hi rend="italic">soghyāthā</hi> (see <ref rend="bold">poetry</ref>) is particularly uncertain.</p>
                    <p>Khamis’s hymns enjoyed great popularity and parts of them were translated into Azeri

                    <p>Prelate of the Syriac Catholic Church and founder and director of the periodical <hi rend="italic">L’Orient Syrien</hi>. Gabriel Khouri-Sarkis was born on 27 Febr.
               1898 in the Christian village of Qatana, Syria, into a devout Syriac Catholic family.
               The family name ‘Sarkis’, hyphenated ‘Khouri’ (Arabic ‘priest’) is testimony to the
               fact that the family boasted a long line of priests. In 1908, he entered the
               Séminaire Oriental in <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref>, Lebanon where, under the direction
               of the French Jesuits attached to the Université Saint Joseph, young seminarians
               drawn from all the eastern churches received their primary education. He continued
               his studies at the Syriac Catholic Patriarchal Seminary at <ref rend="bold">Sharfeh</ref>, where he became acquainted with the scholarship of the eminent
               churchman and scholar, His Beatitude <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref>
               (1848–1929), which was a formative influence on his life. Ordained a priest on 4 July
               1920, Father Gabriel began a life-long collaboration with the then Syriac Catholic
               Archbishop of <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Gabriel Tappuni</ref>
               (1879–1968). Father Gabriel’s appointment to various diplomatic missions in Europe
               and the USA on behalf of the Syriac Catholic Patriarchate expanded his vision of the
               needs of the Syriac Church beyond the lands of its origin. Always a priest first,
               pastoral service dominated Father Gabriel’s life. In 1922 he founded St. Ephrem
               Parish in Paris to serve the pastoral needs of Middle-Eastern Christians of all
               denominations. He also served as chaplain at Clinique Sainte-Marie (Vernon).</p>
                    <p>In 1931, Father Gabriel was named representative of the Patriarchate in Paris and was
               elevated to the rank of ‘Chor-episcopus’, a title usually rendered in English as
               ‘Chor-Bishop’. In 1950 Chor-Bishop Gabriel was decorated with the Cross of the Legion
               of Honor, Le Chevalier, by the French government for his dedication to France during
               the resistance.</p>
                    <p>As a result of his travels throughout Europe and the USA on behalf of the
               Patriarchate, Chor-Bishop Gabriel became aware of the wide-spread lack of knowledge
               of Syriac Christianity in the West. In 1955, with the support and encouragement of
               Jesuit and Benedictine scholars in Europe, he founded <hi rend="italic">L’Orient
                  Syrien</hi>, a scholarly journal of information about Syriac Christianity geared
               to the interested non-specialist. The fledgling journal achieved world-wide
               distribution and featured studies by eminent Syriac scholars. In the course of twelve
               years (1956–1967) 48 issues of the journal were published.</p>
                    <p>A dedicated and beloved priest, ecumenist, and scholar, Chor-Bishop Gabriel died on
               20 April 1968. A memorial volume, for which the initiative had been taken by <ref rend="bold">François Graffin</ref>, appeared in 1969.</p>

                  <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>, the name Kokhe is Aramaic in origin. Kokhe was
               established as a round city to the east of Old Seleucia and until recently was
               believed to be the Parthian center of Ctesiphon. However, Italian excavations under
               Gullini and Invernizzi have conclusively shown that only one stratigraphic layer is
               pre-Sasanian, and that it was primarily mortuary in nature. Sasanian and Syriac
               references to Seleucia or <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>(or al-Madāʾin)
               almost certainly refer to Kokhe, not to the original Hellenistic city. The city was
               the administrative capital of the Sasanians as well as of the Ch. of E. German
               excavations in the 1930s uncovered a church which had at least two phases of use,
               with the later one dating to the end of the 6th cent. Among the finds from this
               structure were an ostracon with a fragment of a Syriac prayer, a number of pieces of
               stucco decoration which mirror Sasanian styles, and the remnants of the stucco statue
               of a saint. The designation and significance of the church are not known, although
               Seleucia-Ctesiphon functioned as the seat of the Cath. of the Ch. of E. from at least
               the early 5th cent.</p>

                    <p>Konat was born in Pampakuda of a priestly family. He studied under his father Yuḥanon
               Konat, and then Gregorios of Parumala. He was ordained a priest in 1883, and a
               chorepiscopos in 1926. Between 1901 and 1911, he served as the Priest Trustee of the
               Malankara Association and continued in this position after the schism of 1911 (he
               sided with the patriarchal faction). He taught at the Old Seminary in Kottayam, and
               later established in his town a seminary and Mar Julius Press where he published many
               liturgical books with prefaces in Syriac. Ignatius Peṭros III/IV bestowed upon him
               the title of Malankara Malpan, and he may have been the first to hold this
               distinguished title. He published a periodical called <hi rend="italic">Sīmat
                  ḥaye</hi> in Syriac and Malayalam (he composed most of its Syriac material). He
               composed and wrote in a beautiful Serṭo hand numerous letters from Malankara to the
               Syr. Orth. Patriarchate. He is also credited with most of the liturgical translations
               made from Syriac into Malayalam which are still used today.</p>

               daily offices, which he prefaced to his edition of this text (Pampakuda, 1915; 4th

               in Malabar (may have been published in <hi rend="italic">Sīmat ḥaye</hi>). He also
               wrote a Syriac grammar, but it is not clear in what language.</p>

                    <p>Kthobonoyo refers to the spoken (rather than the written) form of classical Syriac as
               it is used in recent times. Demographically, it is primarily a W.-Syr. feature; its
               absence in E.-Syr. is probably due to the fact that <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref>, the
               colloquial, has raised itself to a literary language. The rise of Kthobonoyo is due
               to a rise in national identity, especially after the Ottoman constitutional reforms
               of 1908 which provided millet communities the opportunity to form secular
               organizations. Within the Syr. Orth. community, the <hi rend="italic">ʿirutho</hi>
               movement was formed with much enthusiasm by activists like <ref rend="bold">Naʿʿūm
                  Fāʾiq</ref>, and called for the revival of the Syriac language. The first canon of
               the Patriarchal School of <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> (formed in 1912)
               stipulates ‘the conversational language in the school is Syriac’, which is repeated
               in the regulations of the Patriarchal Orphanage in 1920. Speakers of Kthobonoyo
               included educators such as <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon Dolabani</ref> (1885–1969), and
               later Kthobonoyo was promoted by <ref rend="bold">Fawlos Gabriel</ref> (1912–1971),
                  <ref rend="bold">ʿAbd al-Masīḥ Qarabashī</ref>(1903–1983), and <ref rend="bold">Abrohom Nuro</ref> (1923–2009) who was the first to apply it in a home setting.
               In the second half of the 20th cent., the use of Kthobonoyo was enforced in the
               seminaries and some of the village schools in <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, and
               became more popular after immigrations to Europe. Kthobonoyo is primarily a learned,
               non-native language that requires formal training (with a few known native exceptions
               in multilingual settings). The aptitude level of Kthobonoyo speakers varies
               tremendously, despite the fact that speakers tend to be clergymen and <hi rend="italic">malphone</hi> well versed in Classical Syriac. A sociolinguistic
               feature of Kthobonoyo is its male centricity, with very few female speakers.
               Code-switching is frequent, especially in less formal settings. Kthobonoyo is rich in
               neologisms and coined terms. While the phonology and morphology of Kthobonoyo are
               quite similar to Classical Syriac, Kthobonoyo syntax is a subset of that of Classical
               Syriac.</p>

                    <p>Scholar of Semitic and Eastern languages and literatures; professor of Eastern
               languages at the University of Göttingen. His earliest publications are under the
               name Bötticher (Boetticher), the name of his father, which he later replaced by de
               Lagarde (sometimes Latinized into Lagardius), a name that existed in his mother’s
               family.</p>
                    <p>Born in Berlin, de Lagarde studied theology and oriental languages in Berlin and in
               Halle, where he habilitated in 1851. In the following years, he spent much time in
               the British Museum in London, where he was among the first Western scholars to study
               the Syriac manuscripts that had arrived from <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in
               the 1840s. Many of his publications are based on these manuscripts. It was only in
               1869 that he was appointed professor at Göttingen, as the successor of the famous
               Semitist and Hebrew Bible scholar Heinrich Ewald (one of Th. Nöldeke’s teachers).</p>
                    <p>In addition to his publications in such fields as Hebrew, Arabic, Armenian, Coptic,
               and Septuagint, de Lagarde published a number of Syriac texts: the Didascalia
               Apostolorum (1854); other collections of ecclesiastical law (1856); Titus of Bostra’s
               work against the Manichaeans, preserved in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150 of the year
               411 (1859); Syriac texts dealing with agriculture and related issues, continuing the
               Greek tradition of Geoponika (1860); the ‘Recognitions’ attributed to Clement of
               Rome, again from ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150 (1861); and ‘Apocryphal’ books of the OT
               (1861: Bar Sira, Wisdom of Solomon, Tobith, Baruch I and II, Epistle of Jeremiah,
               Judith, Prayer of Ananias and his companions, Bel, Dragon, Susannah, I Ezra, I and II
               Maccabees). A number of shorter texts were grouped together and published as <hi rend="italic">Analecta Syriaca</hi> (1858) and <hi rend="italic">Praetermissorum
                  libri duo</hi> (1879; which has Syriac printed in Hebrew characters). He also
               planned a series entitled <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Syriaca</hi>, of which,
               however, he was able to prepare only the first volume which, after his death, his
               student A. Rahlfs edited (1892). Whereas in his public and university life de Lagarde
               did not shy away from expressing strong views  — thereby sometimes provoking harsh
               reactions and controversy, not least with his Jewish colleagues  — his Syriac work is
               sober and very solid. Most of his editions have been often reprinted and are still
               valuable today (some of them have never been replaced!). De Lagarde’s interests
               extended beyond philology and text editions, into the fields of linguistics and
               lexicography. Quite impressive for his day is his list of ‘Persian, Armenian, and
               Indian words in Syriac’ (included in his <hi rend="italic">Gesammelte
                  Abhandlungen</hi>), which is often quoted in C. Brockelmann’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Syriacum</hi>.</p>
                    <p>De Lagarde was known for his painstaking attention to correct and precise
               typesetting, reflecting the ms. model as closely as possible. Towards the end of his
               life he seems to have been instrumental in the development of a new Syriac printing
               type by the Leipzig printing house Drugulin. He did not live to see it used in his
               own publications, but it was successfully used from the early 1890s onwards, and it
               was eternalized in the second edition of Nöldeke’s <hi rend="italic">Kurzgefasste
                  syrische Grammatik</hi> (1898; repr. 1966) and in its subsequent English
               translation (1904; repr. 2001).</p>
                    <p>A volume to commemorate de Lagarde’s Syriac work in Göttingen was published in 1968
               by the Göttinger Arbeitskreis für syrische Kirchengeschichte. Several of the
               contributions deal with topics on which de Lagarde himself had published or — as in
               the case of <ref rend="bold">Anṭun of Tagrit</ref> — in which he had been particularly
               interested.</p>

                    <p>Bible translator. Lamsa came from the village of Marbishu in Turkey. He attended the
               English mission school in <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref>, later teaching in the school in
               Van. He came to the USA in 1916 or 1917 by way of Argentina, taking the name George
               at the port. He became an American citizen in 1923. He was associated with
               Episcopalian efforts to revive a mission to the Assyrians after World War I: see his
               co-authored book <hi rend="italic">The Oldest Christian People</hi> (1926). His most
               characteristic publications began, however, with <hi rend="italic">My Neighbor Jesus:
                  in the Light of his own Language, People, and Time</hi> (1932). This established
               one of his themes, that the Bible could be illuminated by the customs and language of
               his own Aramaic-speaking community in the Middle East which was, he claimed, little
               changed since biblical times. He published a translation of the Four Gospels (1933)
               and then of the whole New Testament, entitled <hi rend="italic">The New Testament
                  according to the Eastern Text Translated from Original Aramaic Sources</hi>
               (1940)  — the ‘eastern text’ being the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>, which, being in
               ‘Aramaic’, was according to Lamsa the original form of the New Testament. A
               translation of the whole Peshitta Bible, <hi rend="italic">The Holy Bible from
                  Ancient Eastern Manuscripts</hi>, appeared in 1957.</p>
                    <p>Lamsa’s books had an appeal in the Ch. of E. for a time. He was a member of Patr.
                  <ref rend="bold">Eshai Shemʿon</ref> council, and represented the Church as an
               observer at the Vatican Council in 1964. His own religious thought was, however,
               broad and unorthodox, and his greatest influence has been among various small
               Christian and Christian-theosophical bodies in the U. S. A. who continue to reprint
               his works.</p>

                    <p>Syriac scholar; professor at the universities of Amsterdam and Leiden. Born from a
               Dutch family of Norwegian descent, Land enrolled as a student in Leiden in 1850. From
               early on, Syriac, to which he was introduced by Th. W. J. Juynboll, was among the
               subjects that attracted him most. Even before submitting his doctoral dissertation in
               theology (on an OT topic), he published his first monograph, on <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> as a church historian (1856). Land’s first meeting with
                  <ref rend="bold">Th. Nöldeke</ref>, who spent the winter of 1857–58 in Leiden,
               became the beginning of a lifelong friendship between the two men. In the fall of
               1857 Land was awarded a grant to study the Syriac mss. in London, which in the 1830s
               and 1840s had arrived in the British Museum from <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>.
               Like <ref rend="bold">P. A. de Lagarde</ref>, whom he met in London, Land launched his
               own series, <hi rend="italic">Anecdota Syriaca</hi>, in which he planned to publish
               important Syriac texts taken mainly from the British Museum mss. The first volume
               appeared in 1862; three more volumes followed in 1868, 1870, and 1875. Although the
               quality of the editions gave rise to some criticism, these publications significantly
               contributed to making Syriac literature and Syriac studies more widely known in
               Europe.</p>
                    <p>In 1864 Land was appointed professor of oriental languages and philosophy at the
               Athenaeum Illustre, later the municipal university, of Amsterdam. In 1872, he
               returned to Leiden, to occupy the chair of philosophy. While publishing extensively
               on a variety of topics, ranging from philosophy to music, Syriac receded from the
               foreground of his interests, although he kept teaching it. Among his Syriac students
               were W. J. van Douwen (from his Amsterdam period), with whom Land co-authored a Latin
               translation of Yuḥanon of Ephesus’s ‘Lives of the eastern saints’ (1889), G.
               Wildeboer, who wrote his Leiden dissertation on the Curetonian Gospels (1880), and H.
               G. Kleyn, who on the same day submitted two doctoral dissertations in Leiden, one on
                  <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref>, and the other on the Syriac Life of <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Tella</ref> (1882).</p>

                    <p>Benedictine Syriac and Armenian scholar. He was born in Namur and studied in Lyon and
               Rome. From 1959–61 he taught biblical exegesis and Armenian at San Anselmo, Rome, and
               from 1973–82 Armenian and Ethiopic at the Catholic University of Louvain. For
               extended periods he served as Novice Master in the Abbey of St. Maurice in Clairvaux
               (Luxembourg), and then at the Abbey of St. Paul de Wisques (France). In 1953–54
               Leloir re-edited the Armenian translation of <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>’s
               ‘Commentary on the <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref>’ (CSCO 137, 145), at that time
               only known in Armenian. When, in 1957, the Chester Beatty Library (Dublin) purchased
               a ms. containing a large part of the Syriac original, Leloir was asked to edit it;
               this he published in 1963; just over 20 years later, the Chester Beatty Library was
               able to purchase some further folios of the same ms., and these too were edited by
               Leloir (1990, with LT; ET of both by C. McCarthy, 1993). Leloir had a special
               interest in Ephrem’s witness to the text of the Diatessaron, collecting his evidence
               in CSCO 227 (1962). Besides working on Ephrem, he also wrote the valuable entry on
                  <ref rend="bold">Sahdona</ref> (under ‘Martyrius’) in the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire de Spiritualité</hi>. Given his expertise in Armenian, he was also
               able to write authoritatively on the relationship between Syriac and Armenian
               literature (in contributions to <hi rend="italic">OCA</hi> 205 [1978] and 221
               [1983]). His work in the Armenian field was largely concerned with the Apocryphal
               Acts of the Apostles and the Sayings of the Desert Fathers (apart from Ephrem).</p>

                    <p>French art historian and Syriac scholar. In 1920, Leroy entered the Benedictine order
               with the monks of Solesmes who, due to the anti-catholic legislation of the Third
               Republic, were in exile at the Isle of Wight (UK) since 1901 and returned to Solesmes
               (Sarthe) only in 1922. In 1930, he was sent to Rome, where he graduated in biblical
               studies from the Pontificio Istituto Biblico in 1933. For the next twenty years he
               lived as a priest in Paris and taught in various high schools. During his spare time
               he developed an interest in illuminated Syriac mss., which he investigated first in
               the Bibliothèque Nationale and later in the other major European libraries. In the
               early fifties, he studied with André Grabar, the famous scholar of early Christian
               art, who then taught at the École Pratique des Hautes Études, where Leroy graduated
               in 1955 with a thesis on the illuminations of the Syriac <ref rend="bold">Rabbula
                  Gospels</ref>. Starting in 1954, as an employee of the French Centre National de
               la Recherche Scientifique, and stationed for several years at the Institut Français
               d’Archéologie in <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref>, Leroy complemented his earlier work on
               illuminated Syriac mss. in Europe with research in all major collections of the
               Middle East. This led to his pioneering 1964 publication, <hi rend="italic">Les
                  manuscrits syriaques à peintures</hi>, which includes the study of several mss.
               from <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, Iraq, and Syria. In the same period he also
               wrote his ‘Moines et monastères du Proche-Orient’ (1958), which was subsequently
               translated into English (1963; repr. 2004). It covers Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon,
               Syria, Turkey, and Iraq.</p>
                    <p>In the mid-sixties Leroy, together with Serge Sauneron (d. 1976), launched an
               ambitious project that aimed at the documentation of Coptic wall paintings. The first
               volume of ‘La peinture murale chez les Coptes’ appeared in 1975. The second volume,
               which appeared posthumously (1982), included the first detailed description of the
               wall paintings of <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> known at that time. To this
               monastery, situated at the intersection of the Coptic and Syriac worlds, he devoted
               additional publications, studying its condition in the 16th cent. (1967), the
               decoration of the church (including the two 10th-cent. inscriptions on the wooden
               doors) (1974), and a flabellum with Syriac inscription dated 1202/3 (1974–75). His
               contribution to the first Symposium Syriacum (1972) was on the famous 10th-cent.
               abbot of Dayr al-Suryān, <ref rend="bold">Mushe of Nisibis</ref> (published 1974).
               Leroy was the first western art historian with a lifelong commitment to the study of
               the art of the Syriac and other eastern Christian traditions. Along with his
               pioneering Syriac publications, which remain authoritative today, he published
               extensively on Coptic, Copto-Arabic, Ethiopian, and Armenian art. In spite of his
               focused iconographical approach, he always was aware of the larger historical,
               literary, and cultural contexts and paid due attention to the links between eastern
               Christian art and late ancient, Byzantine, and Islamic art.</p>

                  antico fondo dei manoscritti orientali della Biblioteca Vaticana</hi> (SeT 92;
               1939), a masterly treatise on several aspects of the history of Oriental studies in
               Renaissance Europe, while his slimmer monograph <hi rend="italic">Documenti intorno

                  Gregorio XIII</hi> (SeT 143; 1948) is still an important source for such topics as

                    <p>The Christian liturgical rites can be grouped into families, the eastern ones being
               associated above all with Constantinople, <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>, and Alexandria. The various Syriac rites fall under the
               general heading of ‘Antiochene’, subdivided as E.- and W.-Syr., the latter again
               further subdivided into Syr. Orth./Catholic, Maron., and (until the early second
               millennium) Melk.. ‘Antiochene’ is in fact not very appropriate for the E.-Syr. (Ch.
               of E./Chald.) traditions, whose roots were more connected with <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, rather than Antioch.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">General developments</label>
                    <p>Liturgical texts develop considerably over time, and in their present forms they are
               many-layered, with archaic and much more recent elements side by side: the oldest
               elements go back to before the E.-/W.-Syr. ecclesiastical divide (5th/6th cent.), and
               so the two share certain texts (especially in <ref rend="bold">poetry</ref>);
               approximately the 7th to 9th cent. saw the emergence of many rites in the forms known
               today: traditionally, large-scale liturgical reforms are attributed to <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> (d. 659) in the E.-Syr. tradition, and <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub
                  of Edessa</ref> (d. 708) in the W.-Syr.. The earliest long theological prayers
               known as <hi rend="italic">sedre</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">ḥusoye</hi>) in the
               W.-Syr. tradition belong to this period, as do their counterparts, by <ref rend="bold">Shalliṭa</ref> and others, in the E.-Syr. The majority of the earliest surviving
               liturgical mss. belong to the ca. 9th/10th cent. for the W.-Syr. tradition, whereas
               E.-Syr. ones only rarely survive before about 12th cent.</p>
                    <p>It must have been from about the 7th cent. that the Maron. and Syr. Orth. liturgical
               traditions began to separate, with the former often retaining archaic elements lost
               in the latter (e.g. in the baptismal texts and Weekday Office). This may explain
               surprisingly close parallels between the Maron. and E.-Syr. traditions: the Maron.
               Anaphora known as the ‘Sharrar’ (or Peter III) has many prayers in common with the
               Anaphora of Addai and Mari, and the Maronite Weekday Office includes several <hi rend="italic">sugyotho</hi> of E.-Syr. origin where they have named authors of the
               6th and 7th cent. (see Brock 2004).</p>
                    <p>In the Melk. tradition the 10th and 11th cent. witnessed the remarkable transition
               from an Antiochene to a Constantinopolitan rite (roughly co-terminous with the
               Byzantine reconquest of parts of north Syria, 969–1084); this involved a massive
               undertaking of translations from Greek into Syriac (and subsequently into Arabic).
               Several of the poetic texts, including ones by <ref rend="bold">John of Damascus</ref>,
               were subsequently taken over also into the Syr. Orth. tradition, probably in the 11th
               and 12th cent.</p>
                    <p>Although the W.-Syr. liturgical tradition had always included many texts translated
               from Greek, this new influx of materials of Greek origin led to the emergence of two
               slightly different Syr. Orth. traditions, that of Antioch, incorporating these new
               elements, and that of <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref>, which did not. It was essentially
               the Tagrit rite that was introduced into S. India in the 18th and 19th cent.</p>
                    <p>In the E.-Syr. tradition, many rites are traditionally associated with the reforms of
               Patr. Ishoʿyahb III, and/or with the usage of ‘the Upper Monastery’ (of Mar Gabriel
               and Mar Abraham, <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>). Many new texts were incorporated during
               the early centuries of the 2nd millennium, in particular prose texts by Eliya III Abū
               Ḥalīm (d. 1190), verse texts by <ref rend="bold">Gewargis Warda</ref>, and <hi rend="italic">ʿonyāthā</hi> by <ref rend="bold">Khamis bar Qardaḥe</ref> (both 13th
               cent.?).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The Main Liturgical Books</label>
                    <label type="subsubsection">Ch. of E.</label>
                    <p>Three Anaphoras are in use, the archaic Anaphora of the Apostles Addai and Mari, and
               Anaphoras attributed to <ref rend="bold">Theodore</ref> and to <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref>. For the most part only the former was taken over in the Chald.
               and Syro-Malabar Churches, and in both cases provided (in different places) with
               Institution Narratives, which the original lacked (a feature officially recognized,
               however, by the Vatican in 2001 as legitimate). The other two Anaphoras, when taken
               over, were simply called the ‘second’ and ‘third’ Anaphoras (thus the Mosul ed.
               1901). In mss. the Anaphoras are usually combined with the Baptismal service, with
               Marriage and Burial services transmitted separately. In the Syro-Malabar Church,
               whose liturgy had been much adapted to the Roman rite in the 17th cent., there has
               been considerable discussion over the appropriate form of a ‘restored’ (de-Romanized)
               Qurbana (on this, see G. Thadikkatt, <hi rend="italic">Liturgical Identity of the Mar
                  Toma Nazrani Church</hi> [2004]).</p>
                    <p>The Weekday Offices are contained in the <ref rend="bold">Qdām w-Bāthar</ref> (‘Before
               and After’, the weeks being so designated, according to which of two choirs
               commences); for this there is an ET by A. J. Maclean, <hi rend="italic">East Syrian
                  Daily Offices</hi> (1894) and a recent reprint of the Syriac (ed. D.  Benjamin,
               2004; based on de Qelayta’s edition of 1923). Those parts of the services proper to
               Sundays and Feasts are contained in the <hi rend="italic">Ḥudrā</hi>, for which there
               is an edition by T. Darmo (3 vols.; Trichur, 1960–62); better known, however, is the
               earlier Chald. edition by P. Bedjan (3 vols.; 1886–7; repr. 1938; 1 vol. ed., ed.
               P.  Yousif, 2002); a concordance between Darmo and Bedjan is given in <hi rend="italic">The Harp</hi> 19 (2006), 117–36. English translations and studies of
               particular seasons have been made by V. Pathikulangara (Resurrection, 1982; Holy
               Week, 1990), J. Moolan (<hi rend="italic">Subbara</hi>, or Annunciation to Nativity,
               1985), and P. Kuruthukulangara (Nativity, 1989).</p>
                    <p>Another ms. collection, with hymns and anthems for festivals, is known as the <hi rend="italic">Gazza</hi>; this has never been printed, but materials from it are
               included in the editions of the <hi rend="italic">Ḥudrā</hi> by Darmo and Bedjan.</p>
                    <label type="subsubsection">Syr. Orth.</label>
                    <p>This tradition stands out from all others in its number of available Anaphoras, said
               to be nearly 80, though only a dozen or so are in current use, and a large number
               have not yet been published. Some are translated from Greek, while others were
               composed in Syriac, the latest belonging to about the middle of the 2nd millennium.
               Both mss. and printed editions vary greatly in the number and selection of Anaphoras
               they provide, though that of St. James is normally present; this Anaphora, whose
               origins are connected with Jerusalem, provided the structural model for many of the
               other Anaphoras. The largest printed collection, with nineteen, is that of Pampakuda,
               1931, though the critical edition (<hi rend="italic">Anaphorae Syriacae</hi>,
               1939–81), now discontinued, covers 22 anaphoras over the course of its 7 fascicles
               (tables indicating the contents of main printed editions can be found in <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides Liturgicae</hi> 102 [1988], 440–45).</p>
                    <p>Originally there seem to have been at least three different baptismal rites, but only
               that attributed to <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref> remains in use. The Betrothal and
               Marriage rites were once separated in time, but in modern editions they are combined
               as a single rite. There are separate funeral services for clergy and laity, and
               within each of these, for different categories, e.g. bishops, priests, monks, nuns;
               men, women, children. Besides the bilingual editions mentioned in the Bibliography,
               the Syriac texts for Baptism, Marriage, and (Lay) Funerals were published in India by
               the Mar Julius Press (Pampakuda) in 1979.</p>
                    <p>The Weekday Office is contained in the <hi rend="italic">Šḥimo</hi>, for which there
               are several printed editions, notably Jerusalem 1936; Pampakuda (4th ed. 1977), St.
               Ephrem Monastery, Holland, 1981 (and subsequent editions). A  bilingual form of the
               Pampakuda edition was published by SEERI (Kottayam) in 2006. Also arranged for the
               days of the week is a collection of prayers of monastic origin, known as the <hi rend="italic">Šbito</hi> (printed ed. Monastery of St. Ephrem, 1993).</p>
                    <p>Liturgical texts for Sundays and Feasts are provided in the <hi rend="italic">Fenqito</hi>, of which there are two printed editions (Mosul, 1886–96, in 7
               vols., and Pampakuda, 1962–3, in 3 vols.), although in many churches mss. are still
               used. The contents of the two editions, and of individual mss., vary considerably;
               one noticeable difference between the two editions is that the Mosul edition (Syr.
               Catholic) includes the prose <hi rend="italic">Sedre</hi> (which are usually
               transmitted separately in mss., and so are absent from the Pampakuda edition). An
               abbreviated and adapted English version of the Mosul edition was made by Fr. Francis
               Acharya (d. 2002), <hi rend="italic">Crown of the Year</hi> (3 vols.; Kurisumala
               Ashram, 1982–86).</p>
                    <p>The liturgical texts of the reformed Mar Thoma Church in South India are for the most
               part fairly close to their Syr. Orth. antecedents.</p>
                    <label type="subsubsection">Maron.</label>
                    <p>The learned Patr. <ref rend="bold">Istịfān al-Duwayhi</ref> (d. 1704) listed 27
               Anaphoras in use by the Maronites, but printed editions give many less, and some
               later ones give prominence to the Roman rite; a return to the true Antiochene
               tradition was the aim of reforms initiated in 1971, and mandated in 1991. Most of the
               Maron. Anaphoras are shared with the Syr. Orth., though a few are confined to the
               Maron. tradition, notably the archaic ‘Sharrar’. Although Maron. liturgical mss.
               earlier than the 16th cent. are only rarely preserved, many liturgical books preserve
               early features lost in the rest of the Antiochene liturgical tradition. This applies
               in particular to the Baptismal rite and to the Weekday Office (<hi rend="italic">Šḥimto</hi>). An ET of the Divine Office throughout the year, providing texts for
                  <hi rend="italic">Ramšo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ṣapro</hi> for Sundays and
               Feasts, was published by the Diocese of St. Maron (USA) in 3 vols. (<hi rend="italic">Prayer of the Faithful</hi>, 1982–5); this goes back (via French) to a simplified
               edition in Arabic, made by the liturgical scholar (now Bp.) B. Gemayel.</p>
                    <label type="subsubsection">Melk.</label>
                    <p>Only the very oldest Melkite liturgical mss. preserve the original Antiochene rite,
               whereas all the rest represent the Constantinopolitan rite (itself ultimately of
               Antiochene origin), and so the range of different liturgical books is basically the
               same as in the Greek Orthodox tradition. The oldest texts often have materials in
               common with the Syr. Orth. and/or Maron. traditions. In the case of an archaic short
               baptismal rite, there is still no post-baptismal anointing (this had been first
               introduced in the Antiochene area ca. 400). The multilingual character of the Melk.
               liturgical tradition is brought out by the existence of bilingual texts, especially
               Syriac-Arabic, although occasionally Syriac-Greek, or Greek in Syriac characters.
               Syriac remained in use as one of the liturgical languages until at least the 17th
               cent.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>; author of an Anaphora as well as of liturgical
               and theological works. Loʿozar served as Bp. of Baghdad in the early 9th cent.,
               taking the name of Philoxenos. There are indications that he also was known as Basil.
               If that is correct, he probably should be identified with the ‘Basil, Bp. of
               Baghdad’, who along with his two brothers and the son of their sister donated several
               books to the Monastery of Mor Yuḥanon of Qurdis in Dara (one of these books is the
               present ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,151, which contains writings of <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</ref>).</p>
                    <p>Loʿozar is the author of an Anaphora (inc.: ‘Oh God, who are the sea of peace …’),
               which is preserved in a number of Syr. Orth. mss. <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>,
               in his <hi rend="italic">Mnorat Qudše</hi>(‘Candelabrum of the sanctuary’), quotes
               passages from Loʿozar’s (otherwise unknown) work on the divine providence and human
               freewill, in which Loʿozar apparently tried to find a compromise between attributing
               absolute power to providence on the one hand or freewill on the other hand. Elsewhere
               in the same work, Bar ʿEbroyo quotes from one of Loʿozar’s letters, while in his
               ‘Ethicon’ the Maphryono states that Loʿozar wrote about the origins of Syriac
               liturgical chant and about the introduction in the Syriac churches of the ‘<hi rend="italic">qonune</hi>’ of <ref rend="bold">John of Damascus</ref>. We also know
               of a commentary on baptism, a <hi rend="italic">mimro</hi> on the consecration of the
               holy chrism, and a commentary on the words said in the Eucharist, ‘the heavenly bread
               we break’, which led to a controversy and to a schism in Loʿozar’s day.</p>
                    <p>That in spite of Loʿozar’s obvious significance as a writer so little of his works is
               preserved may perhaps be due to the unfortunate end of his tenure as a bp. <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, the chronicler of the year 1234, and Bar ʿEbroyo, in
               his ‘Ecclesiastical Chronicle’, report that Loʿozar was deposed as bp. by his Patr.,
                  <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref>, in 829, due to accusations brought
               against him by some of his own faithful. No details on the nature of these
               accusations are provided.</p>

                    <p>Monk on the Holy Mountain of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, scholar, author of a
               commentary on the Pauline Epistles. The commentary is fragmentarily preserved in ms.
               Brit. Libr. Add. 14,683 (one of the mss. presented to <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  al-Suryān</ref> by the Coptic Patr. of Syr. descent Afrahām b. Zurʿa around 980).
               The commentary was divided into four parts and portions are preserved only for part 3
               (Galatians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians) and part 4 (Hebrews). A
               note written by one of Loʿozar’s disciples, Giwargis of Beth Naqe, gives information
               about his teacher, who is said to have been a scholar in the investigation of dogma
                  (<hi rend="italic">buḥono d-dogma</hi>). The commentary, which is said to have
               been based on the work of <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref>, is provided with
               critical signs (dots and crosses) to assist with the interpretation. Inserted between
               the two parts is a chronological and historical section, which reaches until the
               accession of Caliph al-Mahdī (774) (E. W. Brooks in CSCO 5–6, 337– 341 [Syr.], 265–75
               [LT]). This section seems to provide a date for the composition of the work, if one
               assumes that it belonged to the original work. The scribe of the ms., Ḥarith bar
               Sisin, of Sanbaṭ (probably in Egypt) and of <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref>, is also
               responsible for ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,682, a commentary on the Gospels of John and
               Mark, which was put together (<hi rend="italic">mkannaš</hi>) by Ḥarith on the basis
               of many sources, Christian and pagan (quoted are: John Chrysostom, <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, the Sibylline
               Oracles, and a work called ‘Hermes’). The question then arises whether Ḥarith, the
               copyist of the commentary of ms. Add. 14,683, really was the redactor of the
               commentary of ms. Add. 14,682 (which then would be the redactor’s autograph). Or did
               he only copy the latter, as he did the former? Wright is inclined to see Ḥarith as
               the copyist of both commentaries and to attribute both works to Loʿozar (already in
               his <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi>, and more explicitly in his <hi rend="italic">Short history</hi>). Baumstark, however, refrains from accepting Loʿozar’s
               authorship of the Gospel commentary for lack of evidence. Barsoum agrees with
               Baumstark and regards Ḥarith as the redactor of the Gospel Commentary, whom he takes
               to be a Melkite on the basis of a passage in al-Masʿūdī (in <hi rend="italic">Murūj
                  al-dhahab</hi>). To Loʿozar’s authorship of the commentary on the Pauline
               Epistles, one scholion can be added; it deals with the order of the Seraphs according
               to <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</ref> and it is explicitly
               attributed to him (preserved in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 18,295, f. 149v; see also
               Barsoum, 366).</p>
                    <p>Additional information about Loʿozar’s disciples or his school may be gathered from
               ms. Damascus, Syr. Orth. Patr. 12/23 (previously Jerusalem, St. Mark’s Monastery
               123), which contains works by Pseudo-Dionysius and which was written by Yaʿqub bar
               Yonathan ‘in the school of (…) Rabban Mor (…) of Beth Qandasa’ ca. 890. The date of
               this ms. led Kaufhold to question Loʿozar’s traditional date (which is based solely
               on the chronological section inserted into his work) and to suggest that Loʿozar
               worked a few decades later than has generally been assumed (the alternative would be
               that Yaʿqub bar Yonathan was not Loʿozar’s immediate disciple).</p>

                    <p>The village of Maʿad is 14 km. northeast of Byblos (Jbeil), 52 km. from <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref>, 525 m. above sea level. The Church of Mar Charbel is built
               on the remains of a 1st-cent. temple to the Roman God Satrapos. The base of the
               temple, columns, and capitals were used in the building of a church dating from the
               6th cent. At a later period, in the 12th or 13th cent., a substantial narthex was
               added to the W. end along with new vaulting.</p>
                    <p>At least two layers of decoration are painted on the walls of the church: 1. to the
               first period belong the wall paintings of the apse, and paintings on the northern
               wall of a small annex in the southeast corner of the church, at the end of the
               southern nave; 2. a large Dormition of the Virgin, on the southern wall of this same
               small room, belongs to the second period. Paintings of the second period also cover
               parts of the paintings on the northern wall.</p>
                    <p>In the apse, four evangelists stand on either side of a central crowned saint who has
               not been identified. On the northern wall of the annex are two more unidentified
               saints from the first period, accompanied by two donors, a male and a female. On this
               same wall and partially covering the saints underneath, is the large figure of an
               archangel, between two more saints, also unidentified. These latter saints, and a
               donor on the same wall, belong to the second period. Accompanying the twelve apostles
               and Christ, beside the Virgin’s bier, in the Dormition, are St. Dionysios the
               Areopagite, and also the Jew Jephonias, whose hands have been cut off by the
               archangel Gabriel. The donor of this painting is represented behind Jephonias.</p>
                    <p>All the wall paintings in Mar Charbel are inscribed in Syriac, in a mixture of Serṭo
               and Esṭrangela which sometimes contains Arabic words.</p>

                        <ref rend="bold">Isṭifān al-Duwayhī</ref>, Maron. Patr. in the 17th cent., writes that
               Ḥanna al-Franjiyya, Bint al-Khabbaz, was buried in this church in 1243. This date
               corresponds to the style of the second group of paintings. The style of each layer of
               painting is distinctive. The hand of a 12th  cent. French painter has been identified
               in the first layer. The style of the second layer belongs to the Syr. Orth. tradition
               of <ref rend="bold">Bahdeidat</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>,

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Anonymous 4th-cent. Greek ascetical texts. The original Greek writings survive in
               three overlapping collections probably assembled in Byzantine monastic circles of the
               10th and 11th cent. The most common attribution is to ‘Macarius’, identified with
               either of the famous 4th-cent. Egyptian monks, Macarius the Great or Macarius the
               Alexandrian. Their authorship is disproved by study of the spiritual vocabulary of
               the writings and the use of quotations from them in a 5th-cent. anti-Messalian
               dossier preserved by <ref rend="bold">John of Damascus</ref>. These indications link
               the Pseudo-Macarian texts with an ascetical movement originating in late 4th-cent.
               Asia Minor or Syria, within a culture strongly influenced by Syriac Christianity.</p>
                    <p>The collections contain exhortations and responses to questions about prayer and
               progress in the spiritual life. The writings emphasize conflict between sin and grace
               within the ‘inner person’, characterized in vivid images of sensation, mingling,
               indwelling, and fullness. The sin present in human beings is ‘uprooted’ by divine
               power, when the Lord comes to dwell in the heart and fills it with the Spirit. When
               liberated from the passions, one becomes a ‘perfect’ or ‘mature’ Christian and can
               fulfill the commandments with ease. Despite powerful experiences of the Spirit, life
               continues to be a struggle. Even the perfect Christian is always at risk of relapse,
               whether through inattention or by God’s design as a test of faith.</p>
                    <p>The association of these texts with ‘Messalianism’ in controversial literature of the
               4th and 5th cent. seems to have been unknown or overlooked by both contemporary and
               later authors. The so-called ‘Great Letter’ (<hi rend="italic">Epistola Magna</hi>)
               of Pseudo-Macarius was the major source for <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nyssa</ref>’s
               ascetic treatise commonly known as <hi rend="italic">De instituto christiano</hi>‘On
               a Christian way of life’. Macarian themes and language strongly influenced later
               writers, notably Diadochus of Photike and <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>. At
               least two Syriac translations survive; among these are two 6th-cent. mss., by far the
               oldest extant mss. of the (Peudo-)Macarian corpus. There are also Arabic and Georgian
               versions of some of the texts.</p>

                    <p>This <hi rend="italic">sui juris</hi> Catholic Church of the E.-Syr. liturgical
               tradition represents the continuity of the Catholic ecclesial tradition in South
               India that came into being in the 16th cent. (see <ref rend="bold">Thomas
                  Christians</ref>). Under Portuguese and other European missionary influence in the
               late 16th and early 17th cent. the local Church became heavily Romanized, especially
               after the <ref rend="bold">Synod of Diamper</ref> (1599); Syriac, however, was retained
               as the liturgical language by Archbishop Francisco Roz, SJ, even though the rite was
               adapted to Roman norms. Following the revolt against the Padroado and the Jesuits in
               1653, the Propaganda Fide sent the Carmelite Sebastiani to Malabar (1659) as an
               Apostolic Commissiary, and as a result the Catholic party came under the double
               jurisdiction of the Padroado and the Propaganda Fide, though the influence of the
               former waned after the Dutch took Cochin in 1663. This event, however, led to the
               expulsion of Sebastiani, though not before he had consecrated an Indian bp.,
               Alexander (1663–87) to take his place. Sebastiani left an interesting account of his
               time in Malabar (see Pallath 2006). Another informative account, covering 1773–86, is
               by a Malabar priest (see Paremmakkal 1971), who went to Lisbon in 1783 for the
               consecration of another Indian bp., Mar Karyatil, who, however, died in Goa (1786) on
               his way back to Malabar. With the exception of Alexander and Karyatil, all other
               bishops were Europeans, and it was only in 1896 that three native Indian bishops were
               again appointed, thus marking the beginnings of an indigenous hierarchy, which was
               only able to develop again in the 20th cent.</p>
                    <p>In 1923 Ernakulam was made a metropolitan see, with seven suffragan eparchies, and in
               1958 Changanacherry became a second metropolitan see. Since 1962 a number of
               eparchies outside Kerala have been created (including one for USA, in 2001). On 16
               Dec. 1992 Ernakulam-Angamali was raised to the status of a Major Archbishopric, and
               in 1995 two further metropolitan sees were created (Tellichery and Trichur). There is
               a separate archbishopric in Kottayam for the Knanaya, or Southists (this goes back to
               the creation of an Apostolic Vicariate for them in 1911). There are sizable diasporas
               in North America, Europe, and the Gulf States. The total number of faithful is said
               to be between three and four million.</p>
                    <p>There are a large number of religious communities for both men and women, the most
               well known of them being the Carmelites of Mary the Immaculate (CMI), founded in 1831
               by the Blessed Kuriakos Elias Chavara (who, among other things, set up a Syriac <ref rend="bold">printing</ref> press in Mannanam in 1844).</p>
                    <p>Although very little Syriac literature has ever been produced in S. India, numerous
               literary and, above all, liturgical mss. were copied there, and in the 19th and
               earlier part of the 20th cent. a number of Syriac printing presses were operative
               (St. Joseph’s Press at Mannanam was especially productive). Syriac was regularly
               taught at seminaries, and still is at some, though the shift to Malayam as the
               liturgical language after the Second Vatican Council has led to a great decline in
               widespread knowledge of the language. Among works of Syriac scholarship produced in
               Malabar, two should be singled out: T. Arayathinal’s <hi rend="italic">Aramaic
                  (Syriac) Grammar</hi> (1957; repr. 2007), and E. Thelly’s <hi rend="italic">Syriac-English-Malayalam Lexicon</hi> (1999), based on Audo’s <hi rend="italic">Simta</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Although the reforms of Vatican II have led to the decline of knowledge of Syriac, at
               the same time they have encouraged the recovery of the indigenous E.-Syr. liturgical
               tradition. In practice, however, liturgical renewal has led to much controversy over
               the direction it should take: a return to the Syriac sources, inculturation
               (including the adoption of some Hindu customs), or retaining a more western
               perspective. A vocal advocate for the indigenous tradition of the Thomas Christians
               and author of many books on the subject was Fr. Placid Podipara CMI.</p>

                    <p>The Malabar Independent Syrian Church is the oldest of the various jurisdictions into
               which the non-Roman Catholic section of the <ref rend="bold">Thomas Christians</ref>
               has been divided since the 17th cent. Following the imposition of Portuguese control
               and European bishops after the <ref rend="bold">Synod of Diamper</ref> in 1599, there
               was an attempt by the whole community to break free of Jesuit control in 1653 at the
               Coonan Cross incident. Subsequently, as a result of the successful efforts of
               Carmelite missionaries, the majority of St. Thomas Christians returned to Roman
               obedience (see <ref rend="bold">Malabar Catholic Church</ref>). The remaining section
               (called <hi rend="italic">Puthenkuttukar</hi> or New Party to distinguish them from
               the Romo-Syrians who were <hi rend="italic">Pazhayakuttukar</hi> or Old Party),
               continued to use latinized E.-Syr. rites, but began to come under the influence of
               periodic visitors of the Syr. Orth. tradition.</p>
                    <p>A definitive step took place in 1751 when the Syr. Orth. Mafryono Basilios Shakrallah
               arrived in Kerala, accompanied by Mar Gregorios of <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> and
               another companion, whom the Mafryono soon consecrated with the title ‘Mar Ivanios,
               bp. of India’. The party seems to represent a more systematic attempt to introduce
               W.-Syr. usage than had been the case with earlier visitors. The delegation was also
               authorised by the Patr. to regularize the Orders of the Indian head of the
               Puthenkuttukar community, Mar Thoma V, with the expectation that he would minister
               under the jurisdiction of the Mafryono and his companions. Squabbles about money and
               jurisdiction prevented this intended outcome, and Mar Thoma V died in about 1765,
               without having been re-consecrated, but having himself consecrated his nephew as Mar
               Thoma VI.</p>
                    <p>The Mafryono gathered a small household, among whom he disseminated Syr. Orth. usage.
               Immediately prior to his death in 1764, he consecrated a native priest of the
               Kattumangat family as bp., giving him the title of Mar Koorilose. For several years
               the new bp. lived quietly in a monastic community at Thevanal. In 1770 Mar Gregorios
               and Mar Ivanios consecrated Mar Thoma VI as Mar Dionysios I. Mar Gregorios seems to
               have very soon regretted this action and in 1772 raised Mar Koorilose to the rank of
               Metropolitan. Mar Koorilose also received a ring from the Rajah of Cochin, the
               traditional acknowledgement of the head of the St. Thomas Christians. Mar Dionysios
               managed to imprison his rival, who eventually escaped and fled to the village of
               Anjur in the territory of the Zamorin of Calicut, later British Malabar. A gift of
               land from a prominent Muslim, whose son Mar Koorilose had healed, enabled a Cathedral
               Church to be built at nearby Thozhiyur.</p>
                    <p>Following the failure of validly consecrated bishops among Mar Dionysios I’s
               successors in the early 19th cent., recourse was had to a successor of Mar Koorilose
               at Thozhiyur, Mar Philoxenos II, who consecrated three bishops to Malankara
               Metropolitan (Pulikottil Mar Dionysios II ca. 1813; Punnathra Mar Dionysios III in
               1816; Cheppat Mar Dionysios IV in 1825) and who himself occupied that position for
               several years.</p>
                    <p>Important legal rulings in the 1850s established the independence of the Thozhiyur
               Church from either the Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> or the Malankara
               Metropolitan.</p>
                    <p>In 1894 the two Thozhiyur bishops (Mar Athanasios I and Mar Koorilose V) consecrated
               a Metropolitan for that section of the Puthenkuttukar which repudiated Patriarchal
               authority and desired a degree of reform (see <ref rend="bold">Mar Thoma Syrian
                  Church</ref>).</p>
                    <p>The community has always been Syr. Orth. in rite. It has about 15 churches and
               priests, and several schools. The Church is active in ecumenical activities in Kerala
               and outside India. In 1998 and 2008 the Metropolitans were Ecumenical Observers at
               the Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops. In 2006 both current bishops (Mar
               Koorilose IX and Mar Basilios I) participated in the consecration of bishops for the
               Free Church of England.</p>
                    <p>A Constitution was drawn up in 1947, appointing a Sabha Mandalam, representing all
               the churches, for special business such as electing a bp., and Council of Clergy and
               Laity to assist the Metropolitan in governing the Church.</p>
                    <p>Since the 1970s worship has been celebrated mainly in Malayalam, though Syriac is
               still used for the Daily Offices and midweek Qurbanas at Thozhiyur Cathedral.</p>

               Constitution of 11 June 1932 Trivandrum was made a Metropolitan See <hi rend="italic">sui iuris</hi>, with a suffragan eparchy of Tiruvalla; further eparchies have
               since been created in 1978 (Battery), 1996 (Martandom, in Tamil Nadu), and 2003
               (Muvattupuzha). In 2006 Tiruvalla was raised to a Metropolitan See. A year earlier,
               on 10 Feb. 2005, the status of the Malankara Catholic Church was raised by Pope John
               Paul II to that of a Major Archiepiscopal Church, with the canonical installation
               taking place on 14 May 2005; at the same time the title ‘Catholicos’ for its head was
               officially recognized. Also in 2005 a bp. was ordained, for the first time, for
               Malankara Catholics in America and Europe; in India, however, they have no pastoral
               provision of their own outside the state of Kerala, a matter of grievance to both
               them and the Syro-Malabar Catholics. The total number of Malankara Catholics is
               between a quarter and a half million.</p>
                    <p>There are some flourishing monastic orders, notably the Bethany Fathers (Order of the
               Imitation of Christ, OIC) and Bethany Sisters, and the Daughters of Mary. An
               important liturgical contribution was made by the late abbot of the Kurisumala
               Ashram, Fr. Francis Acharya (Mahieu; 1912–2002) in the form of a four-volume adapted
               translation of the W.-Syr. Weekday and Festal Services throughout the year (<hi rend="italic">Prayer with the Harp of the Spirit</hi>, 1982–6).</p>
                    <p>Although serving all the Indian Churches of Syriac tradition, the St. Ephrem
               Ecumenical Research Institute (SEERI) in Kottayam, inaugurated on 14 Sept. 1985,
               comes under the jurisdiction of the Syro-Malankara bp. of Tiruvalla. SEERI is by far
               the most active promoter of Syriac language and tradition in Kerala, providing, among
               other things, MA and Doctoral programs; it has also hosted international <ref rend="bold">Syriac conferences</ref> every four years, commencing in 1987. Its many

                    <p>The Malankara Orthodox Church (MOC) proudly claims to have been founded by St.
               Thomas, one of the twelve apostles of Christ. From the early centuries of the Common
               Era, the St. Thomas Christians of Kerala had intermittent relationship with the
               Syriac communities in the ancient Persian Empire. Regular contacts were rather
               difficult, because of the Arab-Muslim control of the trade route in the Arabian
               Sea.</p>
                    <p>In the 15th cent. the relationship with the E.-Syr. Church was apparently strong, but
               this was abruptly broken by the Portuguese presence in the Indian sub-continent. In
               the so-called <ref rend="bold">Synod of Diamper</ref> (1599), Dom. Alexis Menezis,
               Archbishop of Goa, with the support of the king of Cochin, was able to bring the St.
               Thomas Christians under the authority of Rome. In 1653 the great majority rejected
               the forced union with Rome at the famous Coonan Cross. As they wanted to retain
               Syriac language and liturgy, and above all the ecclesiastical independence, they
               wrote letters to various Eastern patriarchates requesting to send them a bp. Thus in
               1665, in a Dutch vessel Mar Gregorios, the Syr. Orth. bp. of ‘Jerusalem’ reached
               Kerala and consecrated Mar Thoma  I, as the bp. of the St. Thomas Christians. In
               1685, Mar Baselios Yaldo and Mar Ivanios Ḥidayatallah, two more Antiochian prelates,
               arrived. However, the Syr. Orth. liturgy and the Serṭo script were widely used only
               much later. E.-Syr. influence is evident from the fact the six bishops who headed the
               community between 1665 and 1765 took the title Mar Thoma I to VI.</p>
                    <p>In 1751, the arrival of a Syr. Orth. delegation consisting of Baselios Shakrallah,
               Mar Gregorios, Ramban Yoḥannan, and a few deacons, marks the beginning of the
               introduction of the Serṭo script and the Syr. Orth. liturgy in the Malankara Orthodox
               Church. Mar Thoma VI (consecrated by his predecessor in 1765), the head of the
               Syrians, after much hesitation, consented to be re-consecrated by the Antiochian
               bishops under the name Mar Dionysios I (in 1770).</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile in 1772, the Antiochian bp. Mar Gregorios consecrated a native bp. named
               Mar Koorilose. Mar Dionysios I (alias Mar Toma VI) used his political influence to
               expel the rival bp. to Thozhiyur, in the kingdom of Cochin. This marks the origin of
               the so-called <ref rend="bold">Malabar Independent Syrian Church</ref> (or ‘Thozhiyur
               Church’).</p>
                    <p>In 1815 Pulikottil Joseph Mar Dionysios (consecrated by Mar Philoxenos, the second
               bp. of Thozhiyur) founded the Old Seminary (the present Orthodox Theological
               Seminary) with the generous support of the British Resident Col. Munro. Following the
               death of Mar Dionysios (in 1816), the English missionaries assumed the direction of
               the Old Seminary and modern education started in Kerala for the first time. The
               missionaries had the dream to train native clergy and to reform the liturgical
               practices of the Malankara Orthodox Church. The native clergy were opposed to it, and
               in 1836 the missionaries left the Seminary. However, they did convert a few Syrian
               Christians to the Anglican Church.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, some of the Syrians favourable to the reforms, sent a deacon to <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> and in 1843, Patr. Mar Eliya II consecrated him under the
               name Mathews Mar Athanasios. He was the first Indian bp. consecrated by a Syr. Orth.
               Patr. On his return to India, he led the efforts for reforms with some success thanks
               to the support of the English missionaries and the local rulers. Cheppattu Mar
               Dionysios, the head of the Malankara Orthodox Church was unwilling to fight against
               the reformers, abdicated in favour of a visiting Antiochian prelate named Yoyakim Mar
               Koorilose. Though he could not provide effective leadership for the community against
               the reformers, during his 20 years stay in Kerala, Mar Koorilose visited parishes and
               completed the introduction of Antiochian liturgical practices. In 1864, the Patriarch
               Yaʿqub II consecrated a native prelate named Joseph Mar Dionysios (d.1909). Being
               unable to contain the progress of the reformers, he appealed to the Patr. to visit
               India. Thus Patr. Peṭros III visited Malabar and during his two year stay (1875–77),
               he brought the Malankara Orthodox Church under the Syr. Orth. Patriarchate of
               Antioch. In 1876, the Patr. convened a synod in Mulanthuruthy (near Cochin) and
               established an administrative structure. The parishes over which the ‘Malankara
               Metropolitan’ had little or no control, were organized under six dioceses, and six
               bishops were consecrated. Thus the system of a single metropolitan for the entire
               Church came to an end.</p>
                    <p>A few years later, the royal court of Travancore made a verdict in favour of Mar
               Joseph Dionysios and the Malankara Orthodox Church. The reformed group established
               themselves as an independent church, known as ‘the Mar Thoma Syrian Church’.</p>
                    <p>In the first decade of the 20th cent., the relationship between the <ref rend="bold">Patr. Mar ʿAbdullāh II</ref> and Mar Geevarghese Mar Dionysios became tense on
               the question of authority over properties of the Malankara Orthodox Church. This led
               to the excommunication of Mar Dionysios and the division of the Malankara Orthodox
               Church into two groups, one accepting the supreme authority of the patriarch and the
               other rejecting it. The group led by Mar Dionysios invited <ref rend="bold">Patr.
                  ʿAbdulmasīḥ II</ref>, who was deposed by the Turkish authorities. In 1912, he
               consecrated Baselios Pawlos I (d. 1914), the first Cath. of the Malankara Orthodox
               Church. Thus began the major division and a series of litigations which lasted for
               four decades. In 1934, the General Assembly of the Malankara Orthodox Church adopted
               a Constitution and endorsed the claims of autocephaly. In 1958, the Supreme Court of
               India made a verdict in favour of the Cath. Thanks to the initiatives of the
               Patriarch <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Yaʿqub III</ref>and the Catholicos Geevarghese II
               (1929–64), the two groups were united. In 1964, Patriarch Yaʿqub III presided over
               the consecration of the Catholicos Augen I (d. 1975).</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately the unity did not last for more than 12 years. The Patr. consecrated
               bishops and finally in 1975, a Cath. (‘<ref rend="bold">Maphrian</ref>’) for the group
               which accepted his authority. Now the Malankara Orthodox Church remains divided under
               two Catholicoi and two synods.</p>
                    <p>The Malankara Orthodox Church has a membership of about 1 million, 1100 parishes,
               1200 priests, and 18 bishops. There are several schools, Colleges, Engineering and
               Medical Faculties, hospitals and orphanages under its administration. The Malankara
               Orthodox Church follows the Syr. Orth. Liturgy (Mosul tradition). But the liturgical
               language is Malayalam. Hindi and English are, however, also used in North India or
               outside India.</p>

                    <p>The W.-Syr. Church in India which is an integral part of the Syr. Orth. Church. The
               Syr. Orth. Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> is its spiritual head, and the Cath.
               of India (<ref rend="bold">Maphrian</ref>) is the regional head. The Cath. presides
               over the regional Synod, and, in the role of Malankara Metropolitan, presides over a
               democratic body of elected parish representatives, responsible for temporal
               administration.</p>
                    <p>Though direct evidence is scant, tradition attributes the origins of the Church to
               the Apostle Thomas. The long history of trade between the south-western coast of
               India and the Middle East and the presence of a Jewish community of traders in this
               part of India makes this apostolic connection plausible. The earliest indirect
               evidence, cited by <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref> and Jerome, suggesting the presence
               of Christians in India is from the alleged mission of Pantaenus of Alexandria to
               India in ca. 190 where he is said to have encountered natives who were acquainted
               with the Gospel of Matthew.</p>
                    <p>While the dominant view is that the <ref rend="bold">Thomas Christians</ref> were
               continually in communion with the Ch. of E. under the Cath.-Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th cent.,
               the Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church holds that Thomas Christians held in great
               esteem the ecclesiastical authority of the Patr. of Antioch over the ‘East,’ laid
               down in the canons of the Council of Nicaea (325) and the Council of Constantinople
               (381), ‘East’ being interpreted to include Persia and India. They received bishops
               from Persia, who, at least until the late 5th cent., acknowledged the ecclesiastical
               position of the Patr. of Antioch. As late as the 16th cent., when the ecclesiastical
               relation with the Ch. of E. was in ascendancy, the recognition of the canonical
               pre-eminence of Antioch in Malankara is attested in the ‘Narratives of Joseph the
               Indian’ (1507), although incorrectly identifying the Cath. as the successor of St.
               Peter at Antioch. It further argues that the fragmented evidence concerning the
               pre-Portuguese period is insufficient to establish the doctrinal confession of the
               Malankara Church as that of the Ch. of E. or preclude at least intermittent relations
               with the non-Chalcedonian Patriarchates of Alexandria and Antioch. However, it
               concedes continuous relations with the Ch. of E. between the 14th and 16th cent.</p>
                    <p>The history from the 15th cent. onward is well-documented (see Thomas Christians).
               The community that rejected the authority of Rome in 1653 gravitated to the Syr.
               Orth. Patriarchate of Antioch by 1665, and this relationship was then nurtured by
               bishops who were delegated from Mesopotamia. Schisms within the community seeded the
               current <ref rend="bold">Malabar Independent Church</ref> (ca. 1772), Church of South
               India (1836), <ref rend="bold">Mar Thoma Church</ref> (1889), <ref rend="bold">Malankara
                  Orthodox Church</ref> (1912/1975), and <ref rend="bold">Malankara Catholic
                  Church</ref> (1930) leaving the Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church alone under the
               Syr. Orth. Patriarchate today.</p>
                    <p>The first head of the Church, after it asserted a Syr. Orth. identity, was Archdeacon
               Parambil Thomas (1637–70), the chief protagonist of the ‘Coonan Kurishu Satyam’ of
               1653 (Oath at the Leaning Cross, Mattanchery); shortly thereafter, he assumed
               episcopal dignity with the name Mar Thoma I and was subsequently consecrated
               canonically by the first Syr. Orth. delegate, Mor Gregorios ʿAbdel al-Jaleel, who
               arrived in 1665. He was succeeded by eight indigenous metropolitans who assumed the
               same titular name, ending with Thomas  IX (d. 1817). In the interim, Mar Thoma VI,
               fearing the invalidity of his first consecration by the hands of his predecessor, was
               re-consecrated as Mar Dionysius I in 1770 by Mor Gregorios Yuḥanon, Patriarchal
               delegate, but his successor resumed the line as Mar Thoma  VII. The Dionysios line
               was resumed in 1815 with the consecration of Dionysios II as a rival to the Thomas
               line. Mar Athanasios Mathews was the first to be consecrated by a patr., in 1843 at
                  <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>, but lapsed into schism over Anglican inspired
               reforms. In 1876, Patr. Petros III/IV consecrated six bishops to administer newly
               formed dioceses along with the Malankara Metropolitan Dionysios V (consecrated in
               1865). Dionysios V was followed by other Malankara Metropolitans, prominent among
               whom are Dionysios VI (excommunicated in 1911), Mar Kurillos Paulose, and Mar
               Athanasios Paulose. In 1964, Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Yaʿqub III</ref>
               consecrated Mar Baselios Augen as ‘Cath. of the East,’ only to excommunicate him in
               1975 and replace him with Mar Baselios Paulose II (d. 1996). In 2002, a ‘Cath. of
               India’ was consecrated with the name Baselios Thomas I.</p>
                    <p>Many bishops and monks were delegated from Mesopotamia to Malankara from the 17th
               cent. onwards. Prominent among them are Mor Gregorios ʿAbd al-Jaleel, bp. of
               Jerusalem (arrived 1665, died 1671, interred at North Parur), Maphrian Mor Baselios
               Yaldo (arr. and d. 1685, int. Kothamangalam), Mor Ivanios Ḥidayatallah (arr. 1685, d.
               1693, int. Mulanthuruthy), Maphrian Mor Shakrallah Baselios (arr. 1751, d. 1764, int.
               Kandanad), Mor Gregorios Yuḥanon (arr. 1749, d. 1773, int. Mulanthuruthy), Mor
               Ivanios Yuḥanon (arr. 1751, d. 1794, int. Chengannur), Mor Dioscoros Yuḥanon (arr.
               1806, departed 1809), Mor Athanasios ʿAbd al-Masīḥ (arr. 1825, dep. 1827), Mor
               Kurillos Yuyakim (arr. 1846, d. 1874, int. Mulanthuruthy), Mor Athanasios Stephanos
               (arr. 1849, dep. 1851), Mor Athanasios Shemʿoon (arr. 1849/1881, d. 1889, int.
               Kottayam), Mor Ostatheos Ṣleebo (arr. 1881, d. 1930, int. Kunnamkulam), Mor <ref rend="bold">Elias Malke</ref> (arr. 1909/1927, d. 1962, int. Manjinikkara), Rabban
               ʿAbd al-Aḥad (later Patr. Yaʿqub III) (arr. 1933, dep. 1946), Rabban Mushe Salama
               (arr. 1951, dep. 1959), Rabban Aphrem Paulose (arr. 1960, dep. 1964), and Mor
               Timotheos Aphrem Aboodi (arr. 1965, dep. 1973). Patr. Petros III/IV was the first
               patriarch to visit India (arr. 1875, dep. 1877) and began a tradition of visits by
               all subsequent patriarchs with the exception of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Afram
                  Barsoum</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church has today 17 dioceses and more than 600 churches
               in India and several educational and medical institutions as well as social service
               organizations. Nearly 80 parishes have been established in North America, Europe, the
               Persian Gulf, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand. A few of the churches in India
               are also claimed by the autocephalous Malankara Orthodox Church and are often
               uneasily shared under court direction or are closed for worship. Since 2002, the
               Catholicate is at Puthenkurishu, near Kochi. In addition to the Cath. there are 29
               bishops. The number of faithful is estimated to be over a million; the vast majority
               are concentrated in the dioceses of Ankamaly, Kochi (Cochin), Kandanad, and Kottayam
               — all in central Kerala.</p>
                    <p>The Cath. of India exercises authority over 15 dioceses as well as institutions under
               the Malankara Synod which has 17 bishops. Churches of the diaspora outside India are
               directly under the Patr. but administered by bishops of Indian origin. The Knanaya
               archdiocese of the ‘Southist’ endogamous community — with its origins from a
               Mesopotamian emigration, by tradition, dated to 345 — has an archbishop, independent
               of the Catholicate, with three suffragans, over 70 churches, and a sizeable diaspora
               in Europe and North America. Since 1920, churches have been established in India
               directly under the temporal authority of the Patr. and administered by the
               Patriarchal delegate to Malankara; today these parishes are under a Patriarchal
               Vicariate called the ‘Simhasana’ (‘Throne’) Churches and Institutions with four
               bishops including the Patriarchal delegate and about 30 churches. The major
               monasteries of the Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church at Manjinikkara, Piramadom, and
               Malekurishu fall under this Vicariate. The Evangelical Association of the East — the
               missionary arm of the Church, established in 1924 — has three bishops, one of whom
               presides over the autonomous Honovar St. Antony’s Mission; the Association has about
               45 churches, 10 educational institutions, and other charitable organizations. Since
               1990, the Seminary of the Church, now headed by a bp., has functioned at Udayagiri
               where a four year Bachelor’s degree in Theology is offered. The Church has lay
               organizations for youth, students, women, and Sunday School. The Church has an active
               laity-sponsored presence on the internet with a number of general as well as parish
               websites, discussion groups, radio, and TV sites.</p>
                    <p>The Church curiously retains ‘Jacobite’ in its name, even though the Syr. Orth.
               Church rejects this appellation as pejorative. Thomas Christians were known as
               ‘Nazranis’ in the era prior to European influence. The Christians who asserted a Syr.
               Orth. identity in the 17th  cent. were called the ‘Puthenkoor’ (‘New Allegiance’),
               but this gave way to the term ‘Jacobite’ under European influence. The term appears
               to have been adopted without recognizing its negative connotations elsewhere; its
               continued formal usage results from the distinct historical identity it confers and
               is encouraged by a popular misconception that it is the antique name of the
               Church.</p>
                    <p>Historically, the liturgical language of the Thomas Christians is Syriac. Syr. Orth.
               liturgies were adopted from Mesopotamia over a long period of time and liturgical
               practices evolved, progressively conforming to Syr. Orth. traditions, but with
               notable local adaptations. Malayalam translations of the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> Gospels were first printed in 1811. The first ever print of the
               Syriac <hi rend="italic">Šḥimo</hi> (Simple Prayer) in linotype was published in
               1861. The late 19th/early 20th cent. saw the advent of the Syriac <ref rend="bold">printing</ref> press and the publication of several liturgical texts in Syriac
               and Malayalam by V. Rev. Malpan <ref rend="bold">Matta Konat</ref> at Mar Julius Press,
               Pampakuda; these editions became the authorized versions, de facto. The Reformist
               movement in the 19th cent. prompted worship services in the vernacular Malayalam,
               although it was only in the early 20th cent. that manuscripts and prints of
               translations came into vogue. Today, liturgical services are conducted predominantly
               in Malayalam, although with some remnants of Syriac, primarily in liturgical
               formulas. Most clergymen today have, at best, a rudimentary knowledge of Syriac. The
               musical system based on the Beth Gazo has been influenced by various <hi rend="italic">malphone</hi> from Mesopotamia, most recently, Mor Yulios Elias Qoro
               and Rabban ʿAbd al-Aḥad (later Patr. Yaʿqub III); thus the fusion of different Middle
               Eastern schools of music with local adaptations resulted in a unique musical
               tradition. However, since the 1970s, secular music influenced by the indigenous
               Carnatic as well as Western genres has altered liturgical music indiscriminately and,
               today, the octoechos is known only to the connoisseur. The Malankara Syr. Orth.
               influence on Syr. Orth. churches across the world is most visible in the liturgical
               vestments and clothes produced in Kerala, with a distinct style.</p>

                    <p>This general title is given to the anonymous saintly protagonist of a narrative set
               in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> in the 5th cent. The core original story is found in 5
               mss. In this account, the Man of God is the son of rich senatorial parents, living
               either in Rome or Constantinople. On the eve of an advantageous marriage, he boarded
               a ship and eventually ended up in Edessa. Although sought for, he was not found but,
               one night, his saintly quality was discovered by the custodian of a church in Edessa.
               Questioned as to his identity by the custodian, he first identified himself as one of
               the anonymous poor, but later told his story to the custodian on condition that his
               identity not be revealed. When the Man of God fell sick, the custodian placed him in
               a house for strangers. The custodian had to leave the city for a while and, during
               his absence, the Man of God died and was buried with the poor. Distraught at the
               news, the custodian besought Bp. <ref rend="bold">Rabbula</ref> to help find the
               saint’s body and give it proper reverence. When they entered the place where the poor
               were buried, only the clothes of the Man of God were found, not his corpse. Bp.
               Rabbula promised never to build anything more except hospices for the poor and
               strangers. The whole story contrasts strongly with other narratives of Syr. saints
               who performed miracles and prodigious feats of asceticism. A narrative similar to
               this is found in a Greek ms., but the bp.’s name is not given and details place the
               story at a later date than Rabbula.</p>
                    <p>The core Syriac narrative then is continued in the tradition. In this development,
               the Man of God did not actually die, but left Edessa to escape notice. He returned to
               his parents’ house and lived in it unbeknownst to them. When he died, his sanctity
               and identity were miraculously revealed and miracles occurred round his tomb. His
               parents were given names and, later in the tradition, the Man of God received a name,
               Alexius. Under this name, the tradition spread widely in the European tradition. His
               feast day in the Roman church is 17 July.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Founder of a religious movement (Manichaeism). Mani was born in Mesopotamia. Reared
               in a strict Jewish-Christian baptismal sect, at the age of 12 Mani began to
               experience revelations from a heavenly being called, ‘The Twin’. At 24, he received a
               divine calling to be the ‘apostle of light’, the incarnate Paraclete of God, chosen
               to propagate his ‘lifegiving message’. Due to his frequent travels and bold
               evangelistic proclamation — and the royal protection of Shapur I (242–72) — Mani
               converted many people to his religion. Manichaeism was a complex ascetic system based
               on Zoroastrian dualism, that also included features of Gnostic cosmology, Judaism,
               Christianity, Buddhism, and Babylonian myth. The practice of Manichaeism allowed for
               two classes of followers: the ‘elect’, devoted to liberating spiritual particles of
               light from their material imprisonment through full adherence to the sect’s harsh
               ascetic rules, and the ‘auditor’, who provided for the needs of the elect and
               followed a less severe code, in the hope of eventual reincarnation as one of the
               elect. During the reign of Bahram  I (273–6), the Zoroastrian hierarchy instigated a
               widespread persecution of minority religions, including Manichaeism. Mani was put to
               death ca. 276. Nevertheless, Manichaean missionaries continued to attract converts
               throughout Persia and the Roman empire, into central Asia, where it survived into the
               Mongol period, and even as far as eastern <ref rend="bold">China</ref>. The spread of
               Manichaeism and its use of Christian elements elicited numerous polemical responses
               on the part of orthodox Christians. Mani wrote books in <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref>
               and Pahlavi, though only fragments survive. Seeking to promote his universalizing
               teaching across cultural barriers, he encouraged the translation of Manichaean texts
               into different languages, for which a distinctive Manichean script, akin to Syriac
               Esṭrangela, was devised. Manichaean texts were eventually disseminated in a wide
               variety of languages.</p>

               XIV on 15 Aug. 1889. From 1895–1902 he was head of the <ref rend="bold">Seminary of St.

                <div type="body">
                    <p>The foundation of Syriac studies is the ms. production of past ages. A body of
               perhaps ten thousand Syriac mss. survives today. But any discussion of Syriac
               literature must recall that whole categories of mss. (for example, those containing
               works on medicine and other secular subjects) have not been preserved, and even many
               religious works (e.g. doctrinally suspect works, and commentaries superseded by more
               comprehensive ones) perished because they were copied only rarely or not at all.</p>
                    <p>1. The oldest mss. Although Syriac is well attested in <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref> in the 1st–4th cent., only three mss. are known, all legal
               documents from Osrhoene, with dates 240, 242, 243. These are written on parchment in
               a cursive script akin to the later Serṭo book-hand (see <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac
                  Documents</ref>).</p>
                    <p>2. 5th–10th cent. Surviving literary mss. go back to the 5th cent., including the
               earliest dated codex in any language, a large ms. of ecclesiastical texts translated
               from Greek, written in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> in 411 (ms. Brit. Lib. Add.
               12,150). Generally, Syriac mss. at this period are codices (not rolls), written in
               quires of 10 leaves of parchment (not paper), with writing in 1, 2, or occasionally 3
               columns, in the Esṭrangela script. Early mss. include many examples of fine
               professional calligraphy. The Serṭo script is found in a ms. dated 790 (Brit. Lib.
               Add. 14,158), and thereafter it gradually took over as the normal book-hand in W.
               Syr. mss. except in books used in churches for public reading and singing. Most of
               the mss. that survive from this period come from the library of <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  al-Suryān</ref> in Egypt, where they were brought from Mesopotamia by the abbot
                  <ref rend="bold">Mushe of Nisibis</ref> in 931/2. Some of this collection was
               acquired by the Vatican Library in 1707 and 1715, and almost all the rest of it by
               the British Museum in 1841–51. The other significant old collection of mss.,
               including Melk. ones, is at the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref> on
               Mt. Sinai.</p>
                    <p>3. Later W.-Syr. mss. The earliest known Syriac ms. on paper is dated 932. Paper mss.
               are the norm after the 10th cent., apart from a revival of Esṭrangela writing on
               parchment that was centered in <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> in the 12th–13th cent.
               Mss. in the Serṭo script from the 13th to the 18th cent. are only rarely
               calligraphic. In modern times, fine writing in the Serṭo script has again been
               cultivated by such penmen as Mattai bar Pawlos of Mosul (d. 1947) and Mar <ref rend="bold">Julius Çiçek</ref> (1941–2005), the latter of whom, however, wrote his
               mss. for reproduction in print as an alternative to typesetting.</p>
                    <p>4. E.-Syr. mss. The E.-Syr. church had no counterpart to Mushe of Nisibis.
               Consequently, early E.-Syr. mss. are rare, and often works of E.-Syr. authors are
               preserved in only a single old ms. or copy thereof. Palaeographically, E.-Syr.
               scribes were conservative, and a distinctive E.-Syr. script appears only in the ca.
               14th cent. From the 16th cent. on, however, we have a large number of E.-Syr. mss.
               from N. Iraq, many the work of copyists from the Shikwānā and Nasro families of <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref>. In the 19th cent. more mss. were copied in this area and
               in <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref> for western scholars and collectors.</p>
                    <p>5. Present-day collections. Besides the afore-mentioned ones in London, Rome, and Mt.
               Sinai, there are significant collections of medieval mss. in Europe at the
               Bibliothèque nationale de France; Oxford, Cambridge, and Birmingham Universities (the
               last of these deriving from <ref rend="bold">Alphonse Mingana</ref>); the
               Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin (deriving from <ref rend="bold">Eduard Sachau</ref>); and in
               the USA at Harvard University (deriving from <ref rend="bold">J. R. Harris</ref>).
               These collections all have printed, and in some cases on-line, catalogues. In the
               Middle East, several important collections were destroyed or dislocated in the First
               World War. For the disposition of mss. today it is necessary to consult Desreumaux
               (1991), and even since that publication some movement has taken place. The largest
               collection of W.-Syr. mss. is at the Syr. Orth. seminary at Maʿarrat Ṣaydnāyā, <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>, Syria. The Syr. Cath. Patriarchate in <ref rend="bold">Sharfeh</ref>, Lebanon, also has a significant collection. Most E.-Syr. mss. in
               Iraq have been consolidated by the Chald. Church at the Patriarchate in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>, a smaller number also by the Ch. of E. Archbishopric
               there. The richest library of Syriac mss. in India is at Pampakuda.</p>

                    <p>The Syriac word <hi rend="italic">maphryono</hi> (<hi rend="italic">mprynʾ</hi>)
               literally signifies ‘one who bears fruit’, metaphorically a ‘consecrator’. The
               Anglicized term Maphrian derives from the Arabic form <hi rend="italic">mafiryān</hi>. The term is synonymous with the term ‘Catholicos’. It is used to
               designate the prelate who holds the second rank after the Patr. in the Syr. Orth.
               Church. Three Maphrianate lines are known:</p>
                    <p>1. Maphrianate of <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref>, also known as the Maphrianate of the
               East. It was established in the 7th cent. in order to give the <ref rend="bold">Miaphysite</ref> Syr. Orth. a hierarchy structure in the Persian empire. The
               first Maphrian (though the title was fixed at an unknown date later) was <ref rend="bold">Marutha of Tagrit</ref>, from 628–49, who was consecrated by Patr. <ref rend="bold">Athanasios Gamolo</ref>. The Maphrian, when consecrated by the <ref rend="bold">Patr. of Antioch</ref>, had autonomy and was the sole ruler of the Syr.
               Orth. churches in Persia. He had the right to consecrate and appoint bishops, and to
               consecrate the <ref rend="bold">chrism</ref>, but had to refer to the Patriarch for
               moving a bp. from one diocese to another. This arrangement continued even after the
               fall of the Sasanian Empire soon after. In 869 and again during the patriarchate of
                  <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon X bar Shushan</ref> it was decided that just as the
               patriarch consecrated the Maphrian so the Maphrian consecrates a new patriarch. For
               the first time in 1222, the incumbent Maphrian <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Dawid</ref>
               became Patr. Thirteen Maphrians later became patriarchs at various times. In 1074
                  <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> was added to the Maphrianate, and in 1089, after the
               destruction of <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref> by the Muslims, the Maphrianate moved to
                  <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> during the Maphrianate of Yuḥanon Ṣliba. His successor,
                  <ref rend="bold">Dionysios Mushe</ref>, managed to return to <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref> until 1152 or 1155, after which the Maphrians resided in <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>. Until the 11th cent., the Maphrians were almost
               exclusively from the East, but later bishops from the West were consecrated and sent
               to the East. The last Maphrian of this line was Baselius Behnam IV (1839–59). After
               his death, the Maphrianate, by now titular only, was abolished.</p>
                    <p>2. Maphrianate of <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>. This Maphrianate was under the
               jurisdiction of the <ref rend="bold">Patriarchate of Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>. The first
               Maphrian was <ref rend="bold">Baselios Malki</ref> of <ref rend="bold">Midyat</ref> who
               was consecrated by Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Masʿūd II of Zaz</ref> in 1495. It
               is not clear to what extent the Maphrian held jurisdiction within Ṭur ʿAbdin. The
               last of the Maphrians of this line was <ref rend="bold">Baselios ʿAbd al-Aḥad of Anhil</ref> (1821–1844) who was killed by Kurds in March 1844.</p>
                    <p>3. Maphrianate in India. The establishment of the Maphrianate in <ref rend="bold">Malankara</ref> is intermingled with much controversy. The <ref rend="bold">Malankara Metropolitan Dionesios Yawsep</ref> requested its formation from Patr.
               Peṭros IV in 1875–77, and repeated the request from his successor Patr. <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdulmasīḥ II</ref> around 1902, but the latter strongly refused. After
               ʿAbdulmasīḥ II was deposed and replaced by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdullāh II</ref>, the
               request was made again by the next <ref rend="bold">Malankara Metropolitan Dionysios
                  Giwargis</ref> from ʿAbdullāh II. By this time, there existed in India two
               parties, a <ref rend="bold">patriarchal faction</ref> which desired to remain under the
               jurisdiction of the Patr., and a <ref rend="bold">metropolitan faction</ref> which
               called for an autonomous and sometimes autocephalous church. In 1912, the deposed
               ʿAbdulmasīḥ II consecrated <ref rend="bold">Baselios Pawlos I</ref> of the <ref rend="bold">metropolitan faction</ref> as Maphrian. <ref rend="bold">Pawlos I</ref>
               was succeeded by other local Maphrians consecrated by bishops of the same faction.
               The Patriarch and his faction did not recognize the Maphrianate. In 1958, both
               parties came together and Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Yaʿqub III</ref> recognized
               the incumbent Maphrian. In 1964, the Patr. himself consecrated the next Maphrian,
                  <ref rend="bold">Baselios Augen I</ref> for both parties. The peace was short lived,
               and by 1975 the situation deteriorated. Yaʿqub <ref rend="bold">III</ref> withdrew
               recognition of the Maphrian and consecrated in his stead <ref rend="bold">Baselios
                  Paulose II</ref> from the <ref rend="bold">patriarchal faction</ref>. Since then,
               two lines of Maphrians exist in India.</p>
                    <p>4. At least one Syr. Catholic Maphrian is known, Baselios Isḥaq Jbeir who became a
               Maphrian in 1693. A formal line of the Maphrianate, however, did not exist.</p>

                    <p>The Mar Thoma Church is that section of the non-Roman St. <ref rend="bold">Thomas
                  Christians</ref> which has undertaken a degree of liturgical and doctrinal reform
               under the influence of Church of England missionaries in the 19th cent.</p>
                    <p>The arrival of British administrators and Churchmen in early 19th-cent. Kerala
               coincided with a desire for improved training for clergy. With the encouragement of
               the British Resident, Colonel Munro, a College was founded at Kottayam under Indian
               auspices, though it was soon dominated by missionaries of the Anglican Church
               Missionary Society who arrived in 1816. Under their influence Palakunnathu Abraham, a
                  <hi rend="italic">Malpan</hi> from Maramon, agitated for the removal of some
               liturgical and cultural practices. Abraham was simultaneously genuinely committed to
               W.-Syr. identity, including the use of Serṭo script, which rapidly replaced E.-Syr.
               while he was teaching at the College.</p>
                    <p>Various factions in the community appealed to the Syr. Orth. Patr. at <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>, who, in 1842, consecrated a nephew of Abraham Malpan as
               Mathews Mar Athanasios. His pursuit of reform was inconsistent. He continued as
               Malankara Metropolitan until his death in 1877, though in the preceding year Patr.
               Peṭros III had divided Kerala into seven Dioceses for those who wished to live under
               his jurisdiction. After a decade of litigation, a Court ruling in 1889 declared that
               Toma Mar Athanasios (successor to Mathews Mar Athanasios) was not Malankara
               Metropolitan as he had not been consecrated by a Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>. The ‘Reformers’ were required to leave the ancient Churches and
               erect new buildings. They took the name ‘Mar Thoma Syrian Church’.</p>
                    <p>There was a crisis in 1893 when Toma Mar Athanasios died without having consecrated a
               successor. Recourse was had to the <ref rend="bold">Malabar Independent Syrian
                  Church</ref>, whose bishops travelled to Kottayam in the face of many threats and
               consecrated a son of Abraham Malpan with the title Titus Mar Thoma. Since then,
               Thozhiyur bishops have actively participated at every Mar Thoma consecration, thus
               enabling that Church to remain sacramentally connected to its Oriental Orthodox
               heritage. On five occasions in the 20th cent. Mar Thoma Metropolitans have
               consecrated bishops for Thozhiyur.</p>
                    <p>The ‘agenda’ of the reform was very much determined by the issues which had dominated
               the English Reformation in the 16th cent.: prayer and the departed, the invocation of
               saints, eucharistic Presence. The first two were deleted from liturgical practice.
               With regard to the third, the Mar Thoma anaphoral epiclesis still prays that the Holy
               Spirit will ‘sanctify this Bread that it may be the Body of our Lord Jesus Christ’
               (with a parallel petition over the Cup), though prayer addressed to the Sacramental
               Christ is omitted. Phrases which Anglican influence suggested were capable of a
               ‘monophysite’ interpretation were also amended. Only the Councils of Nicaea,
               Constantinople, and Ephesus are commemorated in the Qurbānā.</p>
                    <p>The form of the Church’s worship remains unmistakably Syr. Orth. The vestments,
               church furnishings, chanting, use of incense, and the general dynamics of worship
               mark it as a Church in the Oriental Orthodox tradition. Its bishops are celibates,
               distinguished by the monastic <hi rend="italic">schema</hi>. They are buried seated
               in their robes. Beards are optional for priests, but are worn by many (all bishops
               have them). The white cassock is universal. Most worship is now in Malayalam, though
               some Syriac formulae remain in use. English and other languages are increasingly used
               outside India.</p>
                    <p>The Church has always had a strong commitment to fostering the spiritual life of its
               members. In the 1880s it inaugurated the world-famous Maramon Convention. Domestic
               prayer and Bible reading are encouraged. Ashrams and, more recently, a celibate order
               of priests have been instituted. The Church has several evangelistic missions
               throughout India, but has not yet applied its evangelistic zeal to any great extent
               in the Diaspora. There is a long tradition of close relations with the Church of
               South India and the Church of North India, though the Mar Thoma Church has said that
               it does not wish to abandon its eastern heritage by uniting with the two
               western-derived Churches. The Church is actively involved in the World Council of
               Churches and other ecumenical bodies.</p>
                    <p>Theological training remains Western in form. Whereas the <ref rend="bold">Malabar
                  Catholic Church</ref> has engaged in an active debate about freeing itself from
               colonially-imposed theological method and rediscovering its Eastern roots, the Mar
               Thoma Church has not yet ventured upon that process.</p>
                    <p>The Church today has approximately 1 million members worldwide, under the oversight
               of ten bishops. The bishops constitute the episcopal synod, presided over by the most
               senior, who is Metropolitan. The supreme governing body is the <hi rend="italic">Sabha Mandalam</hi>, which has over a thousand clergy and lay representatives
               from all the congregations worldwide, and meets annually.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Mara is the presumed author of a letter in which a father gives lessons of wisdom to
               his son, from whom he is separated. Having been led captive, along with others, from
               his home town of Samosata, ca. 50 km. north of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, Mara is
               not allowed by the Romans to return. His lessons have a stoic ring, warning against
               worldly possessions, and encouraging his son to seek true wisdom and freedom.
               Although the examples are mostly taken from Greek culture, there also is mention of
               ‘the wise king’ of the Jews, after whose death (unfortunately the text is not in
               order here) their kingdom was taken away from them in punishment, while the new laws
               that he established live on. This generally has been understood as a reference to
               Jesus. The author thus presents himself as a pagan who has outsider knowledge of
               Judaism and some appreciation of Christianity.</p>
                    <p>If the letter has a historical basis, it most likely dates from the period prior to
               190 or 160, when the Roman Empire still was in the process of establishing its power
               over Osrhoene and Mesopotamia. In a recent study (which includes Syr. and ET), Merz,
               Rensberger, and Tieleman argue that the letter reflects the historical situation of
               the early 70s, when Rome first gained control of Samosata. According to a very
               different reading, however, first proposed by McVey, the letter might be either a
               rhetorical school exercise or a Christian apologetic document pointing out positive
               values of Christianity to educated pagans. While the Christian references are more
               marginal than one would expect in an apologetic text, viewing the letter as a school
               exercise helps understand the poignant anecdote at the end, which is recognizable as
               a ‘chreia’, a pregnant sentence described in late ancient rhetorical handbooks. Some
               archaic elements in the language of the letter, which most likely originally was
               written in Syriac, support an early date, no later than the 4th cent.</p>

               founded his own church. A great number of Christian authors, both in the East and the
               West, wrote against Marcion and his followers, which may be seen as an indication of
               his influence and of the threat he posed to (what later would develop into) orthodox
               Christianity. Since none of Marcion’s writings have survived, his teaching must be
               reconstructed from patristic refutations. Marcion drastically differed from
               mainstream Christianity in his rejection of the OT. In his view, the God of the OT,
               who was the creator of the material world (which was seen as evil) and the
               protagonist in OT history, was not the same as the God whom Jesus Christ revealed in
               the NT. The OT God, even though he was just, was inferior to the perfect, yet hidden
               God of grace of the NT. The OT, therefore, was irrelevant to Christians, even though
               Marcion did not deny its validity for the Jews. Based on these insights, Marcion
               created his own canon of scripture, which consisted of one Gospel (mainly based on
               Luke) and a collection of ten expurgated Pauline epistles. Marcion’s views and canon
               formation had a significant impact on the development of nascent orthodox
               Christianity.</p>
                    <p>Marcion’s followers reached Syria and <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> by the end of the
               2nd cent. According to <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref> (Ecclesiastical History, 5,13),
                  <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref> composed dialogues against the Marcionites (which
               are not preserved), and the ‘Book of the laws of the countries’ contains
               anti-Marcionite polemics, albeit without naming Marcion. In the 4th<hi rend="superscript"/>cent., <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> attacked the Marcionites in
               several of his works. These sometimes strident attacks suggest that the Marcionites
               represented a serious threat in his day. Moreover, Ephrem established a genealogical
               link between Marcion, the arch-heretic, and the later heretics Bardaiṣan and <ref rend="bold">Mani</ref>. Ephrem’s most systematic refutation of Marcion can be found
               in the collection of writings known as the ‘Prose Refutations’. Another
               anti-Marcionite treatise of Syriac origin survives in an Armenian translation and
               mainly deals with the parables of the Gospel and their OT antecedents. The Syriac
               original of this work may be traced back to the (early?) 4th cent., but contrary to
               the view of the most recent editor (Egan), Ephrem should not be seen as its author
               (see Outtier and Bundy).</p>
                    <p>While the significance of Marcion and his movement in the early period of Syriac
               Christianity has been widely recognized since the days of W. Bauer, it is unclear how
               long the Marcionites had their own ecclesiastical institutions in the Syriac world. A
               remarkable episode in the ‘Life of Mar <ref rend="bold">Aba</ref>’ (ed. Bedjan)
               suggests that in mid-6th cent. Mesopotamia Marcionites still had a significant
               presence and were called <hi rend="italic">kresṭyāne</hi>, as opposed to mainstream
               Christians who were called <hi rend="italic">mšiḥāye</hi>.</p>

                    <p>City in upper Mesopotamia and important center of Syriac Christianity, especially for
               the Syr. Orth. Church as the city closest to <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>,
               the seat of the patr. from 1293 until 1932. Despite its strategic location
               overlooking the plain to the south at the point where the road from <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> to <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref> enters the mountains, Mardin seems to
               have been of relatively little importance in Roman and Byzantine times. In Islamic
               times, it was the seat of a line of Artuqids from 1108/9 until 1408. Administrative
               center of a district (<hi rend="italic">sancak</hi>) within the province (<hi rend="italic">vilayet</hi>) of Diyarbakır in late Ottoman times, Mardin is today
               the capital of the province of the same name in the Republic of Turkey.</p>
                    <p>Barsoum mentions as the first bp. of Mardin a certain Christopher named in the Life
               of Mor Abḥai. Historically more certain is Daniel ʿUzoyo, abbot of Qarṭmin (see <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref>), who was made metropolitan of Tella,
               Mardin, Dara, and <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> in 614/5. Until the 12th cent., the
               see of Mardin was frequently joined with that of Kfartuto, apparently with residence
               at first (until 8th cent.?) in Kfartuto and later in Mardin. In the schism that
               followed the death of Patr. Philoxenos Nemrod in 1292, Ignatius bar Wahib (patr.
               1293–1333) became the first in the line of patriarchs who resided regularly in Mardin
               and Dayr al-Zaʿfarān. Following the death of <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos Yuḥanon
                  Dolabani</ref> in 1969, the see remained vacant and was administered by
               patriarchal vicars until the appointment of Philoxenos Saliba Özmen in 2003.</p>
                    <p>Mardin was also an important center of the Syr. Catholic movement and was, along with
                  <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref>, a regular place of residence for the Syr. Catholic
               patriarchs from 1853, when Metr. Yūliyūs Anṭūn Samḥīrī of Mardin was elevated to the
               patriarchate, until the First World War.</p>
                    <p>The presence of E.-Syr. Christians in Mardin is suggested by the inclusion of
               ‘Mardin’ in the titles of bishops of Maypherqaṭ from the 12th cent. onwards. The
               first E.-Syr. bp. specifically for Mardin seems to be the Chald. Ḥenanishoʿ
               consecrated after the schism of 1552. The scholar-bp. Yoḥannan Eliya Mellus
               (1831–1908, metr. of Mardin since 1890) left an important collection of mss. at the
               Chald. episcopal residence. The Chald. see of Mardin lapsed with the death of Israel
               Audo (metr. 1914–41).</p>
                    <p>In 1913, Tfinkdji estimated the Christian population of Mardin at 20,000 out of a
               total population of 50,000, with 6,500 Armenian Catholics, 7,000 Syr. Orth., 1,750
               Syr. Catholics, 1,100 Chald. and 120 Protestants. In 2005, there were reported to be
               75 Syr. Orth., 7 Syr. Catholic, and 2 Armenian families as well as 1 Chald.
               family.</p>
                    <p>The following churches are to be found today or are known to have existed in the past
               in Mardin. Syr. Orth.: 1. Forty Martyrs (in Şar Quarter, west of Cumhuriyet Square,
               formerly Mor Behnam and Sara, 5/6th cent., principal church of Syr. Orth. community
               with former patriarchal apartments); 2. Mor Mikayel (south of town, on the site of
               martyrdom of Michael and his sister, 5th  cent.?); 3. Mort Shmuni (in Teker Quarter
               in eastern part of old city, 6th cent.?); 4. Mor Peṭros and Pawlos (in Gül Quarter
               near eastern end of old city, 1914.); 5. Yoldat Aloho (in Savur Gate Quarter near
               eastern end of old city, 1857, sold in 1953). Syr. Catholic: 1. Yoldat Aloho
               (Immaculate Conception, on Cumhuriyet Square, 1860; the adjacent former patriarchate,
               built in 1895, is now a municipal museum); 2. Mor Ephrem Monastery (in Diyarbakır
               Gate Quarter at western end of old city, 1884). Chald.: 1. Mar Hormizd (east of
               Cumhuriyet Square, 430). Others: 1. St. George (Surp Kevork, former Armenian Catholic
               cathedral, 420); 2. St. Joseph (Surp Hovsep, Armenian Catholic, 1894); 3. St. Barbara
               (Armenian Catholic monastery, demolished); 4. ‘Patriye Kilisesi’ (Latin [Capuchin],
               1884, demolished); 5. Protestant (demolished); 6. former Forty Martyrs (converted to
               mosque in 1170, now Şehidiye Mosque); 7. former Mor Yuḥanon (Syr. Orth., converted to
               mosque in 1950’s, now Zeyt Mosque); 8. former Mor Tumo (now Ulu Cami?).</p>
                    <p>Of the 94 mss. at the Chald. episcopal residence described by A. Scher in 1908,
               sixteen were donated to the Vatican by Israel Audo, but most of the remainder are
               believed still to be in Mardin, along with a good number of mss. transferred there
               from Amid. An important collection of mss. is also to be found at the Syr. Orth.
               Church of the Forty Martyrs.</p>

               the earliest preaching of the Gospel in the Parthian/Persian Empire. Mari, a disciple
               of Addai, is sent to preach in ‘the region of Babel’; starting from <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> his travels are said to have taken him to <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, Arzanene, Beth Zabdai, <ref rend="bold">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref>, Athor, and <ref rend="bold">Nineveh</ref>, continuing on

                  <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, ending up in Dayra d-Qunni, where he
               died. Very probably the Acts of Mari were produced in the Dayra d-Qunni, which became
               famous in the early Islamic period. It is possible that the account of Mari’s travels
               was also intended to act as a counterpart to that of the missionary travels of <ref rend="bold">Mani</ref>. Other sources on Mari, notably <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref> (Ecclesiastical History II, 3) and the ‘Book of the Tower’, limit
               Mari’s preaching to Babylonia. The Acts, which clearly know the ‘<ref rend="bold">Teaching of Addai</ref>’, are probably the earliest source to refer to the
               impression of Christ’s face left on a cloth (<hi rend="italic">sindon</hi>, the term
               also found in the Greek Acts of Thaddaeus, whose date is disputed; in the Teaching of
               Addai his portrait is painted).</p>

                    <p>Greek monastic author of uncertain identity. He is said to have been a disciple of
               St. <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref> and to have lived in Galatia, perhaps also
               spending some time in the desert of Judaea, though his identity and date remain very
               uncertain (thus it has also been suggested that he was another person of that name,
               from Tarsus, with whom <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref> corresponded; this would put him
               a century later). His Greek writings are now available in a good edition (G.-M. de
               Durand, in SC 445, 455 [1999, 2000]); most of these were translated into Syriac
               (where the oldest ms., dated 533/4 calls him ‘Mark the Egyptian Solitary’). His
               writings were evidently quite widely read in E.-Syr. monastic circles; further
               testimony to their popularity is the existence of commentary on his ‘On the Spiritual
               Law’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 6090), by <ref rend="bold">Babai</ref> the Great (died
               628). None of the Syriac translations have yet been edited. Arabic versions of
               several of the works were made from Syriac (ed. I. A. Khalifé, in <hi rend="italic">MUSJ</hi>28 [1949–50], 117–224).</p>

                    <p>Said to be located on the site of the Last Supper and named after the Evangelist, the
               monastery is situated on mount Zion in <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>. Mention of the
               ‘House of Mark’ appears in the 9th cent. in the writings of <ref rend="bold">Iwannis of
                  Dara</ref>. An inscription, discovered in 1940, reads ‘This is the house of Mary,
               the Mother of John who was called Mark. And it was proclaimed a church by the Holy
               Apostles in the name of the Mother of God, Mary, after the Ascension of our Lord
               Jesus Christ into heaven. It was built a second time after Jerusalem was destroyed at
               the hands of King Titus the year 73 of Christ’. The dating in the inscription is
               peculiar as one would expect a Seleucid calendar date, not a Christian one. Afram
               Barsoum dated the inscription to the 6th  cent. on paleographical grounds, while
               later scholars assign it to after the Monastery was acquired by the Syr. Orth. in the
               15th cent. A monastery in the name of the Mother of God was purchased from the Copts
               in 1471/2, before which the Syr. Orth. had owned other properties in the city.
               Kaufhold identified this monastery with St. Mark’s based on a note in the 17th cent.
               ms. London, Brit. Libr. Egerton 704 which was written in the ‘Holy Monastery of the
               Mother of God, called the House of Mark’, and ordination lists from the 18th cent. It
               was around the late 1400s that St. Mark’s became the seat of the Syr. Orth. bp. of
               Jerusalem. The monastery was renovated a number of times, the earliest known
               renovation being in 1718 by Gregorios Shimʿun of Ṣalaḥ, followed by another
               renovation by his successor Gregorios ʿAbd al-Aḥad b. Fanna of <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>. Other renovations took place during 1738–44 by Gregorios Jirjis
               Fattal of <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>, during 1780–92 by Gregorios Bshara, and during
               1833–40 by Gregorios ʿAbd al-Aḥad Dajjala. The last two renovations from the 19th
               cent. were done by Ostethewos ʿAbd al-Nūr of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> during
               1840–77, and Gregorios Jirjis of Ṣadad in 1882. The monastery’s library includes a
               fine collection of mss., ca. 15 of which date from the 7th to the 15th cent. The
               library itself was established probably in the 16th or 17th cent., and the early mss.
               must have been brought from other monasteries in the city, especially from the
               Monastery of Mary Magdalene, and elsewhere. Some of the mss. of <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  al-Zaʿfarān</ref> were transferred to it after World War I. In turn, some of its
               mss. were transferred by Patr. <ref rend="bold">Afram  I Barsoum</ref> to the
               Patriarchate in <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref> prior to the Arab-Israeli war of 1948, and
               later to <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>. A few of the mss. were brought by <ref rend="bold">Athanasios Yeshuʿ Samuel</ref> to the USA in 1948 and are kept now at
               St. Mark’s Cathedral, Teaneck, NJ. A catalog of the library was compiled by Dolabani.
               The monastery became famous with the first publication of the discoveries of the Dead
               Sea Scrolls titled <hi rend="italic">The Dead Sea Scrolls of St. Mark’s
                  Monastery</hi>. In addition to the main church inside the monastery, dedicated to
               St. Mark, there is an adjacent chapel dedicated to Mar Behnam.</p>

               of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>. Few historical details of his life can be
               ascertained. According to <ref rend="bold">Theodoret</ref>, bp. of Cyrrhus, St. Maron
               distinguished himself by a life lived in the open air without shelter. He survived on
               a frugal diet of wild plants and herbs. It is generally accepted that he is the
               addressee of a letter of <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref> written to ‘Maron,
               monk, and hermit’. Maron’s sanctity and spiritual gifts attracted other ascetics as
               well as simple believers. Together they formed what was known in antiquity as <hi rend="italic">Bayt Maroon</hi> ‘The House of Maron’. The monastery of St. Maron
               became identified with its defense of the Christological formulation of the Council
               of Chalcedon (451) which defined two natures in Christ, divine and human. Following
               the Arab expansion and the relocation of the Chalcedonian patr. from Antioch to
               Constantinople, the Maronites withdrew to the mountainous region of northern Lebanon
               where, around 685, they elected a patr., <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon Maron</ref>, and
               constituted themselves as an indigenous Syriac-speaking Chalcedonian community. The
               Maronite Church celebrates the feast of its namesake and spiritual Father on 9
               Feb.</p>

                    <p>The Syriac Maronite Church of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> is an eastern Catholic
               community of Syriac Antiochene origin with no Orthodox counterpart. Its origins are
               traced to the late 4th cent. when Syriac-speaking Christians between <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> and Antioch gathered around a charismatic monk, <ref rend="bold">St.
                  Maron</ref>. In the 5th cent. the community became identified with its defense of
               the Christological formulation of the Council of Chalcedon (451). Liturgically, the
               Maronite Church represents an independent branch of the Edessan tradition developed
               by Syriac-speaking Chalcedonians who established themselves independently of the
               Greek-speaking Mediterranean coast.</p>
                    <p>With the Muslim Arab expansion of the 7th cent., the Maronites took refuge in the
               mountains of northern Lebanon where they lived in relative isolation and assumed a
               distinct identity. This allowed the Maronite Church to preserve its Syriac identity
               while other Syriac-speaking Chalcedonians eventually adopted Byzantine liturgical
               usage. As a result of the absence of a Chalcedonian Patr. of Antioch, late in the 7th
               cent. the monks of the monastery of St. Maron elected a Patr., St. <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon Maron</ref>, who assumed the title ‘Syriac Maronite Patriarch of Antioch
               and All the East’. Since 1790 the Patr. has resided at Bkerke near <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref>.</p>
                    <p>With the coming of the Crusaders to the Levant, contact with the West was established
               and relations with Rome were strengthened. While this helped secure the survival of
               the Maronite Church in the Muslim Middle East, it also inaugurated the process of
               Latinization that began in the 13th cent. and that continued through modern times.
               The legislation of the Council of Trent (1545–63) and Latin liturgical customs were
               introduced into Maronite usage. In 1583 a Maronite College was founded in Rome and
               played an important role in fostering the study of the East in Europe. In 1736 the
               Synod of Mount Lebanon was convened under Papal aegis; the Synod radically altered
               the liturgical and canonical life of the Maronite Church by formalizing and codifying
               centuries of Latinizing influence into law. This Romanizing tendency persisted until
               the Second Vatican Council (1962–5) mandated that all eastern churches begin a
               process of renewal that would return them to the authentic expression of their
               cultural, spiritual, and liturgical roots. As a result, over the past fifty years the
               Maronites have eliminated many Latinizing customs and have restored authentic Syriac
               Maronite usage.</p>
                    <p>In modern times the Maronite Church has experienced a revival of its ancient monastic
               origins in the form of a return by some monks to the anchoritic or secluded ascetical
               lifestyle. In addition to Maronite eparchies (dioceses) in Lebanon and throughout the
               Middle East, eparchies now exist in the USA, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, and
               Canada.</p>

                    <p>Times of persecution and of martyrdom fall into four main periods: 1. early 4th cent.
               (and again under Julian, 361–3), within the Roman Empire (i.e. approximately Turkey,
               Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine); 2. mid-4th to mid-7th cent., in the Persian
               (Sasanian) Empire (approximately modern Iraq and Iran); 3. under Arab rule; and 4.
               under Ottoman rule and in modern times. It is only from the first two periods that
               sizeable collections of ‘Martyr Acts’ in Syriac are available. From both a literary
               and a historical point of view these works can vary enormously in character: a few
               are brief factual reports made more or less at the time; many more are later literary
               reworkings which, even though they may sometimes be based on reliable sources, have
               introduced imaginary dialogues between persecutor and persecuted whose aim is to
               edify and give encouragement to those who read or hear them; miraculous elements also
               tend to appear. In other martyr acts the miraculous takes over on a large scale and
               they take on an epic character.</p>
                    <p>Two groups of Syriac Martyr Acts from the Roman Empire are of especial importance:
                  <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref>’s Palestinian Martyrs, whose complete form survives
               only in Syriac translation, and the various martyrdoms associated with <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The Edessene martyrdoms fall into two distinct categories, historical and legendary.
               The former concern the deacon Ḥabib and the laymen Shmona and Gurya, who were
               martyred probably in 309 and 310; all three came from villages around Edessa, but met
               their death in Edessa. Although the accounts have been embellished with dialogues and
               miraculous elements, it is likely that the basic information given is reasonably
               reliable. This cannot be said concerning two other Edessan martyrdoms, the Acts of
               Sharbel and those of Barsamya, which purport to be contemporary accounts of events
               that took place under Trajan in 105: both can be shown to be fictional accounts put
               out in the first half of the 5th cent. by circles in Edessa which also produced the
                  <ref rend="bold">Teaching of Adda</ref>i and the legend of the city’s
               conversion.</p>
                    <p>Outside the Roman Empire it appears that there was no persecution of Christians under
               the Parthian dynasty, which came to an end in 226. Under the Sasanians (224–651)
               serious persecution first arose only after Constantine and his successors had adopted
               Christianity; it is significant that most of the outbreaks in the 4th and 5th cent.
               were at times of war with the Roman Empire. The persecution of the 340s under Shapur
               II was the most widespread, and produced a large number of martyr acts, of varying
               historical reliability. <ref rend="bold">Shemʿon bar Ṣabbaʿe</ref>, bp. of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> (which was beginning to emerge as the
               patriarchal see) was one of the first to be put to death (probably in 344). The
               persecution extended to villages as well as to towns and included lay people as well
               as clergy. Knowledge of these Persian martyrdoms reached the Roman Empire by means of
               Greek translations and Sozomen’s account in his Ecclesiastical History (II.9–14), as
               well as by word of mouth. A list of these martyrs was given at the end of a ms.
               written in Edessa in November 411 (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,150).</p>
                    <p>Subsequent persecutions again occurred in ca. 420 (at the end of the reign of
               Yazdgard I and beginning of that of Bahram V), and ca. 445 (under Yazdgard II), but
               on a much smaller scale; both were at times of hostilities with the Roman Empire.
               Several accounts of the martyrdoms during these persecutions survive, especially for
               the former (some of these are by a certain <ref rend="bold">Abgar</ref>; there is also
               an account in <ref rend="bold">Theodoret</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History, V, 39).
               Martyrdoms continue to occur down to the end of the Sasanian Empire, but after the
               middle of the 5th cent. they are almost all confined to isolated cases of converts
               from Zoroastrianism of noble birth. Several long accounts of these, often of great
               historical interest, survive in both Syriac and Greek; these include the Acts of
               Grigor (who managed to become a general after his conversion, but was eventually
               martyred in 542), the learned Cath. <ref rend="bold">Aba</ref> (540–552), two women
               martyrs, Shirin (558/9) and Golindush/Mary (591), Giwargis (George) and his sister
               Mary (613), Ishoʿsabran (620), and Mogundat/Anastasius (628) whose martyr acts
               enjoyed great popularity in Greek and Latin.</p>
                    <p>The earliest and most detailed information about persecution and martyrdoms in <ref rend="bold">Nagran</ref>, in the South Arabian kingdom of <ref rend="bold">Ḥimyar</ref>, comes from three related Syriac texts, one of which is a Letter by
                  <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun of Beth Arsham</ref> written in 524, while subsequent
               Martyr Acts are in Greek, Ethiopic, and other languages. The date of the persecution
               is not certain: 518, 522, and 523 are the possibilities.</p>
                    <p>Several Martyr Acts survive from the early centuries of Arab rule, though only a very
               few are written in Syriac, and these are incorporated into Chronicles. Under the
               Umayyads there were only isolated martyrdoms and the majority of martyrdoms took
               place under the early Abbasids, in particular during the caliphates of al-Manṣūr
               (754–75) and al-Mahdī (775–85). Those martyred fall into a number of different
               categories. Christian Arabs in particular were under considerable pressure to convert
               to Islam, and a number of those who resisted were put to death. Muslim converts to
               Christianity, and Christians who had converted to Islam and then returned to
               Christianity were in especial danger of martyrdom, and among the latter category
               there are cases of Christians who had been captured as children and then been brought
               up as Muslims, but who subsequently decided to return to their original faith.
               Prisoners of war were sometimes forced to apostasize, and those who refused were put
               to death (in some cases this was a matter of reprisals). Non-Arab Christians living
               under Arab rule were (at least in the earlier period) in less danger of suffering
               persecution and martyrdom unless they openly provoked the authorities. In the
               following centuries persecution tended to be intermittent and local, though none the
               less dire; this was especially the case under the Mongol ruler Timur Lang (Timurlane)
               in the 14th cent.</p>
                    <p>Although later centuries (both under Ottoman rule and more recently, in the 20th and
               21st cent.) have witnessed periods of persecution with many martyrdoms in the Syriac
               and other Churches of the Middle East, the genre of Martyr Acts seems to have largely
               died out in languages other than in Greek (for which the <hi rend="italic">Neon
                  Martyrologion</hi> provides many examples from the Ottoman period). A notable
               martyr of this period was <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun II,</ref>Mafryono of <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> (1740). Records, if they exist, of massacres and martyrdoms are
               primarily to be found in the course of historical accounts and in poetry; this
               applies in particular to the appalling massacres of 1895/6 and 1915 (<ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref>, the year of the ‘Sword’), when all the Syriac communities suffered
               immense losses, as well as the Armenians. Many of the victims were killed
               specifically because they refused to deny their faith.</p>

                    <p>Bp., doctor, and co-convenor of the Synod of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>
               (410). There are several late sources for his life in Armenian (ed. Marcus), Greek
               (ed. J. Noret, in <hi rend="italic">AB</hi>91 [1973], 77–103), and Arabic (Chronicle
               of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref>, chap. 66; Yaqut, under ‘Mayyafariqin’; Ibn al-Azraq);
               probably all go back to lost Syriac sources. Son of a local governor, he evidently
               trained as a doctor before becoming bp. of Maypherqaṭ (Greek Martyropolis, modern
               Silvan). His medical skill won him the favour of Yazdgard I (399–420), and when he
               was sent by the Roman emperor as a legate to Persia in 410, he and <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq</ref>, the bp. of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, were able to get the Shah’s
               permission to convene a synod there, at which the Council of Nicaea was officially
               accepted by the Persian bishops; the part played by him at this Synod of 410 is
               described in the account of that Synod in the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon
                  Orientale</ref> (ed. J.-B.  Chabot [1902]). Marutha is said to have translated the
               Canons of Nicaea into Syriac, but as this statement is attached, not to the 20
               genuine Canons (some of which also feature in the Canons of the Synod of 410), but to
               the 173 ‘Pseudo-Apostolic’ Canons, this remains doubtful. A number of Syriac texts
               concerning the Council of Nicaea are attributed to him, edited (along with other,
               unrelated, documents) by A. Vööbus (CSCO 439–40; 1982); his authorship of these is
               very uncertain. It was probably on his visit in 410, or on an earlier (399), that
               Marutha gained knowledge of some of the Acts of the Persian martyrs under Shapur II,
               a collection of whose bones he brought back as relics (hence his see gained the name
               Martyropolis). It is also possible that the list of names of these Persian martyrs at
               the end of the earliest dated Syriac ms., written in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> in
               November 411 (ed. F. Nau, in PO 10.1, 7–26), was provided by him on his return home;
               he may likewise have arranged for the collection and translation of some of these
               Acts into Greek (ed. H. Delehaye, in PO 2). A homily on New Sunday is thought by its
               editor (M. Kmosko, in <hi rend="italic">OC</hi> 3 [1903], 384–415) to be by this
               Marutha. According to one calendar (PO 10.1, 63) he was commemorated on 3 Oct.</p>

               ten years at the famous monastery of Mar Zakkay, near Kallinikos, in the Roman
               Empire. On returning to the Persian Empire he taught at the <ref rend="bold">Dayro
                  d-Mor Matay</ref>, before being appointed the first metropolitan of Tagrit with
               the title ‘<ref rend="bold">Maphrian</ref>’ (ca.  629). <ref rend="bold">Michael

               on the Blessing of the Waters at Epiphany, however, definitely belongs to the later
               Marutha. Marutha also wrote a commentary on the Gospels, from which only quotations
               survive. An Anaphora (included in the Maron. Missal of 1592) and at least one <hi rend="italic">Sedro</hi> are transmitted under his name.</p>

                    <p>Mary, mother of Jesus, features prominently in all the Syriac liturgical and literary
               traditions. A special commemoration, the ‘Praises of Mary’, devoted to her
               immediately following the Nativity, is found in both E. and W. Syr. tradition, on the
               2nd Friday after the Nativity in the former, and on 26 Dec. in the latter. Again in
               both E. and W. Syr. traditions, the Annunciation is primarily celebrated during the
               ‘Period of the Annunciation (Subbara/Suboro)’, covering the Sundays immediately
               before Christmas. A separate commemoration on 25 March was added in the Syr. Orth.
               tradition in the early Middle Ages, and in the Chald. tradition. Also distinctive to
               the Syriac Churches are the agricultural commemorations of Mary of the Seeds (15
               Jan.) and Mary of the Blades of Wheat (<hi rend="italic">šeble</hi>; 15 May).</p>
                    <p>The Gospel genealogies concern only Joseph, but in due course a number of traditions
               grew up concerning her lineage (Davidic and/or Levitical), and besides Joachim and
               Anna as the names of her parents, a few texts provide Zadoq and Dina as alternatives.
               The earliest elaborations of traditions concerning her life are to be found in the
               2nd-cent. (Greek) Protogospel of James, translated into Syriac. She features
               obliquely in the <ref rend="bold">Odes of Solomon</ref> (Ode 19), and very prominently
               in <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi> on the Nativity (some
               of which are written with her as the imagined speaker [e.g no. 11]). She is also the
               subject of a group of early <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi> attributed (wrongly) to
               Ephrem, as well as of a number of <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> by <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>. She features as the protagonist in several dialogue <hi rend="italic">soghyāthā</hi> (Mary and the Angel, Mary and Joseph, Mary and the
               Magi, Mary and the risen Jesus), and in a number of anonymous <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> (including a narrative poem on Mary and Joseph). Some of the earliest
               texts concerning the death, or ‘Departure’, of Mary are preserved in early Syriac
               mss., and these play an important role in the study of the development of traditions
               concerning her Dormition/Assumption. Numerous liturgical texts commemorating her in
               both prose and poetry are to be found in all the Syriac liturgical traditions; in the
               Melk. tradition, in particular, there are many texts on Mary which are translated
               from Greek (including the ‘Akathistos’). In the verse texts especially, great use is
               made of typology, whose aim is to bring out different aspects of her miraculous
               birthgiving and the relationship between her and her Child; thus numerous
               prefigurations of her in the OT are identified, such as the ‘fleece’ of Judg. 6:36–7,
               ‘thirsty earth’ of Is. 53:2, or ‘door’ of Ez. 44:2. Most of these ‘types’ are also to
               be found in Greek and Latin liturgical poetry, and this applies to the extensive
               contrasted Eve/Mary typology, which gave rise to the imagery of the divine Word being
               sown in Mary’s ear, thus providing a specific contrast with Eve’s listening to the
               serpent’s false promise. Some of the ‘types’, however, are distinctive to the Syriac
               tradition: thus Mary as a ‘tree’ is based ultimately on Ephrem’s Commentary on Gen.
               22:13, where the ram ‘held’ in the tree (bush) is seen as a type of Christ, the Lamb,
               held in Mary’s womb.</p>
                    <p>At the roots of the controversy over the use of the title ‘Bearer of God’ (<hi rend="italic">yāldat alāhā</hi>) lie two different conceptualizations of how
               salvation for humanity is brought about by Christ. For the W.-Syr. tradition the Word
               of God descends and underpins, as it were, humanity at the incarnation, so that the
               title ‘Bearer of God’ simply expresses Mary’s role in salvation history. For the Ch.
               of E., however, salvation is conceived as being effected for humanity through the
               raising of Christ’s body, representing our humanity, at the Ascension; accordingly,
               it is essential to distinguish mentally between Christ’s divinity and the humanity
               which he has assumed at his birth from Mary, otherwise salvation would not be
               ensured.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Humanist, early scholar of Syriac. Born in the village of Lennik, near Brussels,
               Masius studied Hebrew, Greek, and Latin in Louvain. Throughout his life he combined
               his intellectual curiosity with his diplomatic skills, traveling through Europe,
               often in the service of ecclesiastical or political authorities. After having studied
               some Arabic with Guillaume Postel in Rome, he made the acquaintance of <ref rend="bold">Mushe of Mardin</ref>, who taught him Syriac in Rome in 1553. In the same year he
               also met <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan Sullaqa</ref>, for whom Masius did some translation
               work from Syriac into Latin. Both men, Mushe and Sullaqa, are quoted as authorities
               in Masius’s later Syriac publications. With Mushe, Masius corresponded in Syriac: ten
               letters are preserved dated between 1553 and 1555 (Wesselius). Preceded only by <ref rend="bold">Teseo Ambrogio</ref>, Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter, and Guillaume
               Postel, Masius belonged to the first generation of European scholars who had an
               academic interest in the Syriac language.</p>
                    <p>While Masius was involved in the Antwerp Polyglot Bible (Biblia Regia) printed by
               Christophe Plantin (Christoffel Plantijn) between 1569 and 1572, he did not prepare
               the Syriac NT text that is included in it (this was done by the young French scholar
               Guy Lefèvre de la Boderie). Masius contributed, however, two major tools that were
               included in vol. 6 of the Polyglot (1571): a Syriac grammar and a Syriac glossary
                  (<hi rend="italic">Syrorum Peculium</hi> ‘Private property of the Syrians’). These
               two works may be seen as ‘the first European grammar and dictionary of Syriac’, while
               his grammar served as a model for several subsequent grammars (Contini). Prior to his
               work for the Polyglot, Masius published a Latin translation of <ref rend="bold">Mushe
                  bar Kipho</ref>’s Commentary on Paradise (1569). This was the first Syriac
               literary work to be brought to the attention of European intellectuals (it was
               reprinted in Migne’s PG 11, 481–608, but the Syriac text remains unpublished). For
               this translation, Masius relied on a Syriac ms. that he had bought from Mushe of
               Mardin (it is now lost). Another important ms. in Masius’s possession contained part
               of the Pentateuch and the Historical Books of the OT in the version of the <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref>. Masius never published this text, but quoted from it
               in his <hi rend="italic">Peculium</hi> as well as in a study on the OT Book of Joshua
               (1574). This ms. too was subsequently lost. It is generally assumed that it was
               somehow related to ms. Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, C 313 inf., which was published
               by A. M. Ceriani and which contains the Wisdom Books and the Prophetical Books of the
               OT. Masius’s ms. and the Milan ms., when complete, together must have contained the
               entire OT in the version of the Syro-Hexapla (Baars).</p>

                    <p>Name given by modern scholars to an 8th/9th-cent. compilation in W.-Syr. as well as
               in E.-Syr. tradition, containing various philological and grammatical materials to
               serve as a tool for the standardization of orthography and pronunciation of the
               Syriac language. The major part consists of sample texts drawn from the OT, the NT,
               and patristic texts in order to illustrate the correct use of the language in writing
               and reading.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">1. Name</label>
                    <p>The term ‘Masora’ (‘tradition’) was adopted from the well-known Hebrew Masora, which
               fixed the orthography and pronunciation of the Hebrew Bible (‘Masoretic text’).
               However, in contrast to the Hebrew Masora, the character of the Syr. ‘masoretic’
               compilations is not normative but regulative: Based on sample texts they standardize
               the orthographic representation of the pronunciation; they are not fixing the text
               itself by introducing an exclusive orthography. In the Syriac mss., the title of the
               compilation (at least of its first and largest part) is: ‘Booklet of (vocalized)
               words and readings of the OT and the NT according to the tradition of Qarqaphto’ (<hi rend="italic">Kurroso da-šmohe w-da-qroyotho d-ʿattiqto w-da-ḥdatto ʾa(y)k
                  mašlmonutho qarqphoyto</hi>, ms. Vat. Syr. 152), or shorter: ‘Booklet of
               (vocalized) words of the Holy Scriptures’ (<hi rend="italic">Kurroso da-šmohe
                  da-ktobhe qaddiše,</hi>ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,178). According to the longer title
               the compilation originated from the <ref rend="bold">Qarqaphto Monastery</ref> near
                  <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Mašlmonutho Qarqphoyto</hi>
               would, therefore, be the appropriate Syriac title. This Syriac title, however, did
               not succeed in replacing the convenient modern term ‘Masora’ and its derivation
               ‘Masoretic’, both of which should be used with quotation marks.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">2. Historical Background</label>
                    <p>The historical background of the ‘Masora’ is the fading away of Syriac as the
               colloquial language of Syr. Christians after the rise of Islam. This situation
               stimulated grammar and lexicography among the Syrians to consolidate the native
               language and cultural heritage in order to preserve the Syr. Christian identity. Some
               of the materials compiled in the ‘Masora’ can be traced back to the 7th cent. and
               derive from <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (ca. 633–708), who introduced the
               systematic study of grammar and orthography among the W. Syrians. He might be the
               initiator or instigator of the ‘Masora’, which started to flourish immediately after
               his death.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">3. Manuscript Witnesses</label>
                    <p>There are 15 mss. of the ‘Syriac Masora’ in W.-Syr. tradition: Brit. Libr. Add.
               12,178 (9th/10th cent., from the ‘Nitrian collection’ of the British Library); Brit.
               Libr. Add. 14,667, ff. 1–12 (10th, OT only); Brit. Libr. Add. 17,162, ff. 1–14 + Dayr
               al-Suryān Syr. 14 (10th/11th, OT only); Brit. Libr. Add. 14,482 (11th/12th, OT only);
               Brit. Libr. Add. 14,684 (12th/13th, OT, NT, and Greek Fathers); Vat. Syr. 152
               (979/80); Barberini orient. 118 (ca. 1000); Syr. Orth. Patr. Dam. 7/16 (Aug. 1004),
               and 12/22 (colophon lost; the date 666 AD given in <hi rend="italic">ParOr</hi> 19
               [1994], 606, is not the date of the ms.); Borg. 117 (1868, a copy of Dam. 7/16);
               Harvard 176 (according to M. H.  Goshen-Gottstein 1303 Sel. = 991/92 AD; Gospel of
               John); Brit. Libr. Add. 7183 (ca. 1031–1034); Lund 58 (1204/05); Paris, Bibl. Nat.
               Syr. 64 (1134/35); Jerusalem, St. Mark 1* (Baumstark)/42 (Dolabani; 16th/17th). The
               single ms. of the ‘Masora’ in E.-Syr. tradition is Brit. Libr. Add. 12,138 (April
               899). One ms. formerly in Chicago was a xerox-copy of Syr. Orth. Patr. Dam. 7/16.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">4. W.-Syr. ‘Masora’</label>
                    <p>In mss. of the W.-Syr. tradition, the compilation is divided into four distinctive
               sections. Within these sections, however, the arrangement and size of the materials
               may differ.</p>
                    <p>a. The first and largest section (for title, see above) consists of extracts taken
               from all books of the OT and NT <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>, and of the <ref rend="bold">Ḥarqlean</ref> version of the NT. The extracts, which are usually
               confined to half-verses or even to single words, are fully vocalized and furnished
               with <hi rend="italic">quššoyo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rukkokho</hi> (for ms. Vat.
               Syr. 152, see Hatch, <hi rend="italic">Album</hi>, plate LXXV). Marginal readings
               drawn from various biblical mss. (e.g. from the Philoxenian version) or from
               patristic authorities refer to different modes of spelling, reading, and punctuation.
               In some mss., to this first section are appended ‘(vocalized) nouns and readings from
               the books of the holy teachers’ (<hi rend="italic">šmohe wa-qroyotho da-ktobhe
                  d-mallphone qaddiše</hi>), drawn from the writings of various patristic authors
               that were held in high esteem in the Syr. Orth. tradition (see under 5).</p>
                    <p>b. The second section of the compilation is devoted to writings of Yaʿqub of Edessa
               (even though there are appended materials not deriving from Yaʿqub). It contains: 1.
               Yaʿqub’s letter ‘On Syriac Orthography’ (<hi rend="italic">meṭṭul serṭo suryoyo</hi>)
               addressed to Giwargi, bp. of Serugh, ‘and through him to all the scribes who will
               encounter this book’ (ed. by P. Martin [1869] and G. Phillips [1869]). 2. Yaʿqub’s
               tract ‘On persons and tenses’ (<hi rend="italic">meṭṭul parṣupe w-zabhne</hi>), in
               most of the mss. entitled ‘On Points’ (<hi rend="italic">meṭṭul nuqze</hi>), as it
               deals with diacritical points to distinguish persons and tenses and with metrical
               points or accents (ed. by G. Phillips [1869]). 3. Only in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,178
               an anonymous tract on metrical points is appended; and 4. (in most of the mss.) a
               tract on the ‘Signs of punctuation’ (<hi rend="italic">šmohe d-nuqze</hi>) by ‘Thomas
               the deacon’ (identified by some scholars with <ref rend="bold">Tumo of
               Ḥarqel</ref>).</p>
                    <p>c) The main source of the third section are the writings of <ref rend="bold">Epiphanius
                  of Salamis</ref> (d. 403), well-known for his anti-heretical writings. Its title
               is ‘Signs of punctuation of Epiphanius’ (<hi rend="italic">šmohe d-nuqze
                  d-Epiphaniyus</hi>). The materials it contains are of lexicographical (‘on Greek
               accents and conjunctions’, ‘on weights’, ‘on measures’, ‘on variation of the person
               by points’), biographical (‘on prophecy’, ‘on the death of the prophets’, ‘on the
               Apostles’) and stichometric (OT and NT) character.</p>
                    <p>d) The fourth section consists of heterogeneous materials and starts with an
               explanation (<hi rend="italic">puššoqo</hi>) of words from Hebrew and from other
               languages drawn from the Septuagint (<hi rend="italic">Mašlmonutho d-šabʿin</hi>) and
               the ‘correction’ (<hi rend="italic">Turroṣo</hi>) of Yaʿqub of Edessa. This is
               followed (in ms. Vat. Syr. 152) by a tract of a ‘Philosopher on the seven climates’
               (probably by <ref rend="bold">Dawid bar Pawlos</ref> d-Beth Rabban). A text attributed
               to <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> ‘on the composition of man’ and a tract ‘on the unity
               of Christ’s body’ by ‘some stranger’ (<hi rend="italic">ʾnoš ʾakhsnoyo</hi>) conclude
               the whole compilation.</p>
                    <p>The differences of the sections in arrangement and size (and the total absence of
               several items from some mss.) suggest a textual development and history of the
               compilation. The original Western ‛Masora’ may be dated to the 7th cent. (<hi rend="italic">terminus post quem</hi> is the Ḥarqlean version of 615/16) and was
               probably devoted to the biblical materials only. Yaʿqub’s death 708 offers the early
               8th cent. as <hi rend="italic">terminus a quo</hi> for the first development (the
               second section). The fully developed compilation may be dated to the 8th or 9th cent.
               Whether the development derives from the Qarqphoye monks is not clear. However, the
               materials compiled in the ‘Masora’ are of homogeneous character in that they reflect
               the main authorities of Miaphysite theology and philology (biblical and patristic
               texts, Yaʿqub of Edessa) and deal with orthography and pronunciation of Syriac.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">5. The Patristic Selections in the W.-Syr. Manuscripts</label>
                    <p>While Masoretic mss. so far have received attention mainly from biblical scholars,
               the patristic selections, which in most W.-Syr. mss. are an integral part of the
               collections, have recently been studied in great detail by J. Loopstra (2009). At
               least eleven mss. are known to contain patristic selections. They include the
               following texts: 1. the ‘Cathedral Homilies’of <ref rend="bold">Severus of
                  Antioch</ref> (in the translation of Yaʿqub of Edessa), preceded by four letters
               exchanged between Severus, John of Alexandria, and the Synod of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>; 2. the Homilies of <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>,
               followed by the Pseudo-Nonnus mythological scholia, both in the revised translation
               of <ref rend="bold">Pawla of Edessa</ref>; 3. Epistles <ref rend="bold">of Basil of
                  Caesarea</ref> and Gregory of Nazianzus; 4. the Homilies of Basil; 5. the <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Dionysian</ref> corpus (in the translation by Phocas of Edessa);
               6. the Life of Severus of Antioch by <ref rend="bold">John bar Aphtonia</ref> (found in
               one ms. only: Brit. Libr. Add. 7,183); 7. and the <hi rend="italic">Arbiter</hi> of
                  <ref rend="bold">John Philoponos</ref> (found in one ms. only: Brit. Libr. Add.
               14,684). The patristic sections of the ‘Masoretic’ mss. clearly demonstrate the
               non-normative (but regulative) character of the ‘Masoretic’ standardisation (although
               patristic writings are scarcely attested in post-‘Masoretic’ mss.). It is quite
               obvious that the standard does not refer to the spelling of Greek proper nouns and
               theological terms (which is not uniform in the ‘Masoretic’ mss. themselves) but to
               their proper phonetical representation (which may vary within the standard of
               grecization). In addition to that, the patristic sections of the ‘Masora’ provide
               unique insights into linguistic and lexical studies by Syrian scholars and scribes,
               as well as into an important branch of the educational system of the Syr. Orth.
               tradition.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">6. E.-Syr. ‘Masora’</label>
                    <p>The E.-Syr. ‘Masora’ (Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue … British Museum</hi>, vol.
               1, 101–08; studied by Th. Weiss, 1933) is more extensive than its W.-Syr. counterpart
               as it is of almost exclusive biblical character (OT and NT, Peshitta only). The
               biblical samples are extensively annotated in the margins. There are five sections:
               the first deals with the pronunciation (phonetic); the second with the use of the
               accents; the third is devoted to various letters of the alphabet and their specific
               combinations (the letters <hi rend="italic">b-d-w-l</hi>; the letters <hi rend="italic">b-g-d-k-p-t</hi>; <hi rend="italic">ʾ-m-n-t</hi> as marking tenses
               and persons; <hi rend="italic">ʾ-h-w-y-k-n-t</hi> when suffixed). The fourth section
               gives an explanation of certain critical marks attached to words in the biblical part
               of the ms. The fifth section (last page) gives ‘traditions of the masters of the
               schools.’</p>
                    <label type="subsection">7. Bar ʿEbroyo’s Testimony</label>
                    <p>According to <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, ‘Book of Splendors’ (ed. and transl.
               by A. Moberg 1922/1907), §3 of the introduction, the <hi rend="italic">Qarqphoye
               </hi>monks introduced the five ‘Greek’ vowel signs to Syriac. This innovative
               ‘Masoretic’ feature follows (but simplifies) the model of Yaʿqub of Edessa, who
               invented seven vowel <hi rend="italic">letters</hi> for grammatical demonstration
               (see Segal, <hi rend="italic">Diacritical point</hi>, 40–7). The five ‘Greek’ vowel
               signs were not intended to be fully applied to Syriac texts but restricted to
               ‘grammatical’ specification of difficult or ambiguous words. Fully vocalized mss. do
               not antedate the 16th cent. and take into consideration the reader’s ignorance of the
               traditional pronunciation. The witnesses of the ‘Syriac Masora’ are the earliest mss.
               with vowel signs attached to the text by the original scribe.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">8. ‘Pre-Masoretic’ and ‘Masoretic’</label>
                    <p>Although the ‘Masoretic’ system of vocalisation was not designed to replace the use
               of the ‘pre-Masoretic’ diacritical point, which served to distinguish grammatical
               persons and tenses, the imperfection of the traditional system called for further
               specification. The ‘Masoretic’ innovation was the adoption of the diacritical point
               and its explicit redefinition by vowel signs and <hi rend="italic">quššoyo/rukkokho</hi>. The coexistence of the old and new system of grammatical
               distinction is evidenced in the ‘Masoretic’ mss. themselves (esp. in ms. Vat. Syr.
               152 and ms. Barberini orient. 118): <hi rend="italic">quššoyo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rukkokho</hi> are marked with large red dots to distinguish them
               from the smaller black diacritical point. This explicit redefinition allowed the
               traditional diacritical point to maintain its position in the Syriac literature; by
               its redefinition the diacritical point introduced the new ‘Masoretic’ standard to the
               ‘pre-Masoretic’ Syriac literature.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">9. The <hi rend="italic">Qarqphoyē</hi> Monks Ṭubhono and
               Sobho</label>
                    <p>Two of the <hi rend="italic">Qarqphoye</hi>monks are known by name: Ṭubhono and
               Sobho, both of Reshʿayna, who are mentioned in the margins of the ‘Masoretic’ mss.
               and in an entry of <ref rend="bold">Bar Bahlul</ref>’s Lexicon (ed. R. Duval, col.
               1363–1364). Sobho is probably the scribe of mss. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,428 (undated;
               Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue … British Museum</hi>, vol.  1, 9–10), Add.
               14,430 (724 AD; Wright, ibid., 15–6), and Add 12,135 (726 AD; Wright, ibid., 24–6).
               In his OT commentary (‘Storehouse of Secrets’ ) and once in his ‘Book of Splendors’
               (I.5, §4) Bar ʿEbroyo refers (occasionally with some distance) to the reading of the
                  <hi rend="italic">Qarqphoye</hi>monks (in Psalms and Jeremiah; the texts are in P.
               Martin, ‘Tradition karkaphienne’, 261–8).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">10. The ‘Masora’ in Recent Scholarship</label>
                    <p>It was P. Martin who in his ‘Tradition karkaphienne’ (1869) identified the
               ‘Masoretic’ character of the compilation. Parts of the E.-Syr. ‘Masora’ were
               published in 1933 by Th. Weiss. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the
               W.-Syr. ‘Masora’ no (critical) edition has been undertaken so far. For editors of the
               Syriac OT and NT, the ‘Masoretic’ mss. seem to be of no great critical value on
               account of their abridged and selective way of quotation. Nevertheless, ‘Masoretic’
               mss. have been extensively used in research on the OT Peshitta. Although excluded
               from the ‘Leiden Edition’ of the OT, the ‘Masora’ contributed to the research on the
               ms. tradition of single OT books (P. B. Dirksen, on Judges [1972]; M. Koster, on
               Exodus [1977]; and A. Gelston, on Twelve Prophets [1987]). The Peshitta Gospel
               edition prepared by Ph. E. Pusey and G. H. Gwilliam (1901) includes the E.-Syr.
               ‘Masora’ as well as three mss. of the W.-Syr. ‘Masora’ (mss. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,178;
               Add. 7183; and Add. 14,648). This Gospel edition turns the ‘Masoretic’ sample texts
               into a complete edition by its systematic adoption of the Western pronunciation. It
               is fully vocalized with the five ‘Greek’ vowels and furnished with <hi rend="italic">quššoyo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rukkokho</hi>. However, it does not give the
               ‘Masoretic’ orthography of the proper nouns and Greek (loan) words, but rather
               follows the orthography of the ‘pre-Masoretic’ mss. A ‘Masoretic’ edition of the
               Peshitta Acts and Epistles was published in 1920 by G. H. Gwilliam and J. Pinkerton
               (British and Foreign Bible Society).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Conclusion</label>
                    <p>Bringing together the fields of grammar and lexicography, the ‘Masora’ is of general
               significance for the study of Syriac language and literature; it also contributes to
               our understanding of the history and culture of the Syrians. The ‘Masoretic’
               perspective on Syriac literature allows for the distinction of a ‘pre-Masoretic’
               (5th– 7th cent.) and a ‘Masoretic’ (8th–13th cent.) period, both with their own
               characteristic features. The earlier period was the formative period of Syriac
               culture, open to Greek influence, development and inculturation into the Greek
               Byzantine Oikumene; it roughly coincides with the pre-Islamic history of the Syrian
               Churches. The later period is marked by philology, standardization, and by the
               formation of ‘national’ E.-Syr. and W.-Syr. traditions. This conservative attitude
               towards their own heritage roughly coincides with the history of the Syriac Churches
               under Islam. Still today reading and writing of Syriac texts is directed by the
               ‘Syriac Masora’.</p>

               1509). Masʿūd was a vigorous promotor of monastic life in Ṭur ʿAbdin. He is the
               author of the <hi rend="italic">elpo ruḥonoyto</hi>‘the Spiritual Boat’, a work
               intended to guide monks and solitaries to the ‘haven of impassibility’. Written in
               the dodecasyllable meter, it is essentially an ascetical and mystical treatise. It is
               divided into three parts, on trinity, on christology and on the divine gifts and
               virtues distributed by Christ to the Angels and human beings. The third part is based
               indirectly on the Celestial Hierarchy of <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Dionysius the
                  Areopagite</ref>. As a Patr. he appointed a maphr. and twelve bishops for Ṭur
               ʿAbdin, which caused much confusion. According to Barsoum, some senior bishops
               denounced him to the Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>. Masʿūd had to step back
               for some time, but was again in function by the end of his life. According to the
               continuator of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History, these
               senior bishops denounced him however to the Emir of Ḥesno d-Kifo, who confined him to
               a monastery. As a result he abdicated and ordered his followers not to appoint a new
               Patr. of Ṭur ʿAbdin.</p>
                    <p>The main source of Masʿūd’s life till his episcopal ordination is a short note
               written by his disciple ʿAziz which is preserved in the oldest ms. of the Spiritual
               Boat, now kept in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>. According to this note Masʿūd
               composed some other writings, which do not seem to have been preserved.</p>

                    <p>Located on the Alfof Mountain, known in Arabic as Jabal Maqlūb, 35 km. northeast of
                  <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, the monastery is mostly known by its Arabic name Dayr
               Mār Mattā. It is named after a monk named Matay who came from the region of <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref> in the latter part of the 4th cent. It is known from
               historical documents as early as the late 5th or early 6th cent., when it was already
               a center of the Syr. Orth. Church. The Chronicles of <ref rend="bold">Michael
                  Rabo</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> record that life resumed at the
               monastery by the end of the 5th cent. Monasticism took various forms in the
               monastery, including monks who were <hi rend="italic">ʾabile</hi> ‘anchorites’, <hi rend="italic">ḥbiše</hi> ‘recluses’, and <hi rend="italic">ʾiḥidoye</hi>
               ‘hermits’, but others preferred communal life. The monastery appears to have had a
               bishopric line from its early days, whose title often included <ref rend="bold">Nineveh</ref> (i.e. Mosul). It was also here that a number of local Synods took
               place. The bishopric of this monastery was so strong that on many occasions,
               especially from the 7th cent. onward, the residing bp. would challenge the authority
               of the <ref rend="bold">Maphrian</ref>, to the degree that he became a de facto
               co-equal to the Maphrian, each of them ruling over half of the Syr. Orth. Church in
               the East. In 869, Patr. Yuḥanon III held a Synod which reiterated the subordinate
               position of the Maphrianate of the East in relation to the Patriarchate of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>. In addition, the first Canon of that Synod made it clear
               that the bp. of the monastery is to be subordinate to the Maphrian. Michael Rabo also
               reiterated this relationship in 1174. The monastery was famous for its magnificent
               library which is cited in the correspondence of <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref> in
               the 8th cent., and later by <ref rend="bold">Dawid bar Pawlos</ref>of Beth Rabban. It
               is also mentioned in a colophon of a Syriac ms. (Berlin, no. 327) that in 1298 the
               library contained all the writings of Bar ʿEbroyo. In 1171, the Kurds attacked the
               monastery and many of the mss. were damaged; some that survived were carried by monks
               to Mosul. In 1369, another Kurdish attack on the monastery damaged more mss. Today
               mss. from this monastery can be found in the British Library, Cambridge University
               Library, Staatsbibliothek, Berlin, and the Vatican Library. The monastery served as
               the seat for the Maphrian on many occasions. Bar ʿEbroyo spent the first seven years
               of his Maphrianate here. During the early 19th cent., the Kurds raided the monastery
               many times, and as a result it was abandoned for 12 years. Later that century, Oswald
               Parry, a delegate of the Archbishop of Canterbury, visited the monastery and
               published an account detailing life there. In modern times, the monastery was the
               venue of the Dayro d-Mor Matay Synod in 1930, the first and only Synod with
               representation of the laity. The Beth Qadishe of the monastery contains the remains
               of six Maphrians and many bishops including Bar ʿEbroyo and his brother. The
               monastery has over 50 rooms, 3 halls for gathering, and a church. To the left of the
               monastery is a large cave with natural mountain spring water dripping from the
               ceiling. Today, the monastery is the seat of its own archdiocese.</p>

                    <p>Notable Greek theologian and author. He was an intrepid defender of the dyothelete
               position (‘two wills’ in the incarnate Christ), in defiance of Heraclius and his
               successors who upheld a monothelete christology; he was finally condemned to
               mutilation and exile under Constans II, but was posthumously rehabilated at the
               Council of Constantinople in 680–1. Monotheletes were evidently strong in Syria and
               Palestine, where literature against the dyotheletes (‘the heresy of Maximus’) was
               produced; relics of this survive in Syriac, notably a short work by Shemʿun of
               Qenneshre, preserved in two Chronicles (<ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, XI.9, and
               the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of 1234</ref>; parallel FT in Guillaumont); this claims
               to be based on ‘books of the Maronites’, one of which is an early (hostile)
               biography, which remarkably states that Maximus originated from Palestine and not
               Constantinople (as the Greek tradition claimed; the evidence is weighed up by
               Boudignon).</p>

                    <p>Syriac Medicine comprises the efforts of the Syriac-speaking communities of the West
               and the East to avoid disease and cure ailments. The focus in the present article
               will be on Syriac medical literature of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages; at the
               end of the entry, the role of Syriac-speaking Christians in the development of
               hospitals will come under scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>The Syriac medical tradition, as Syriac literature in general, owes a great debt to
               the Greek heritage, and notably to the Galenism of Late Antique Alexandria (see
               Temkin). Two periods of Graeco-Syriac translation mark this transfer of knowledge.
               The first occurred during the early 6th, and the second during the 9th cent.. The
               first period is mainly associated with <ref rend="bold">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref>, a
               W.-Syr. priest who studied medicine and philosophy in Alexandria. He translated many
               philosophical texts, but also the so-called Sixteen Books of <ref rend="bold">Galen</ref>, a selection of works used to teach medicine in Alexandria, as well
               as other works by Galen; Theodoros, the bp. of Karkh Juddan (fl. ca. 525–45),
               commissioned a number of them. The E.-Syr. <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d.
               ca. 873) and his school dominate the second period. It has to be emphasised that
               Ḥunayn’s school produced many more and often much better translations than the
               6th-cent. translators (see Gutas). Despite their popularity, few of these Syriac
               versions survived; the Arabic versions by Ḥunayn’s school quickly eclipsed them. We
               are, however, able to study the Graeco-Syriac translation technique, not least since
                  <ref rend="bold">Bar Bahlul</ref>’s ‘Lexicon’ incorporates the vocabulary lists used
               by Ḥunayn and his entourage (see Bhayro).</p>
                    <p>Syriac authors did not limit themselves to translating Greek sources, but also wrote
               many independent treatises on various aspects of medicine. But here again, most of
               the literature is lost today. There are, however, at least two works which ought to
               be mentioned here. The most substantial extant medical text in Syriac is the
               so-called ‘Syrian Book of Medicine’ by an unknown author and of unknown date
               (estimates range from the 6th to the 13th cent.). It consists of three distinct
               parts: Part One is mainly based on Galen’s ‘On the Affected Parts’ and ‘On the
               Composition of Drugs according to Places in the Body’; Part Two deals with
               astro-medicine, that is the impact of the stars on human health; and Part Three
               contains many popular and magic recipes and treatments. <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan bar
                  Sarapion</ref> (Ibn Sarābiyūn) compiled the second extant independent work: a
               medical encyclopedia (<hi rend="italic">kunnāš</hi>) in seven books which is lost in
               the Syriac original, but does survive in Arabic, Latin, and Hebrew translations
               (Pormann). It provides an outline of Galenic medicine, the first four books dealing
               with diseases ‘from tip to toe’; the fifth with bites by insects and poisonous
               animals, skin condition, and gynaecological disorders; the sixth with fevers; and the
               seventh with ‘compound drugs’, i.e. it contains many thousands of recipes. Yoḥannan
               bar Sarapion continues the Greek encyclopaedic tradition as represented by Paul of
               Aegina (fl. ca. 640s), but also incorporates the pharmacopoeia of the East (notably
               Indian) into the system of humoral pathology inherited from the Greeks.</p>
                    <p>We know of many famous Syriac-speaking physicians. Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq was not only a
               translator, but also the personal physician of a number of caliphs. Likewise, his
               teacher Yūḥannā b. Māsawayh (d. 857) also excelled in the medical art. Both mostly
               wrote in Arabic, and acquired great fame in the area of ophthalmology. The most
               prominent Syriac medical family are without any doubt the Bukhtishūʿ. They hailed
               from the famous city of Gondeshapur (<ref rend="bold">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>), and were in
               the employ of various caliphs from the 7th to the 10th cent.</p>
                    <p>This leads us to the final topic: hospitals set up by Syriac Christians. Some
               scholars have argued that by the 4th cent. sophisticated hospitals existed in the
               Christian world (e.g. in Cappadocia or Gondeshapur); but these claims have rightly
               been dismissed (see Dols; Horden). It is, however, beyond doubt that Christian
               charitable ideas had an impact on the development of Islamic Hospitals (Pormann).
               From a letter to the Ch. of E. Patr. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref> (d. 823) we
               know that a substantial Syriac hospital was in existence by the late 8th cent.; it
               was called <hi rend="italic">xenodocheion</hi> (Greek for ‘place for strangers’) and
                  <hi rend="italic">bimāristān</hi> (Persian for ‘place of the sick’). Moreover, a
               number of important Abbasid officials who set up Islamic hospitals  — such as ʿAlī b.
               ʿĪsā, the ‘good vizier’ (d. 946) — had Syriac family backgrounds or ties to the
               Syriac medical elite.</p>

               Road’ intersected the north-south route along the Euphrates. Its name appears in
               forms such as <hi rend="italic">Malidiya</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Melidi</hi> in
               Hittite and Assyrian records from the middle of the 2nd millennium BC. Melitene
               became an important garrison town under Roman rule and was made a provincial capital
               in the 4th cent. (of ‘Armenia  II’, renamed ‘Armenia III’ in 536). The city lay in an
               area that often changed hands between the Byzantines and the Arabs after the rise of
               Islam. It was first attacked by the Turks in 1058, and, after periods of rule by the
               Armenian curopalate Philaretos Brachamios and the similarly Armenian, though
               Chalcedonian, Gabriel (Khoril) of Melitene, it passed to the Danishmendids in 1101
               and then to the Rum Seljuks in the 1170’s. The Mongols first reached the
               neighbourhood of Melitene in 1231, and attacked the city on several occasions in
               1243–44 and 1251–53. Melitene continued to be ruled by the Seljuks under Mongol
               suzerainty until it fell to the Mamluks in 1315. The city was taken by the Ottomans
               in 1516. The modern city of Malatya, to which the majority of the population migrated
               in the 19th cent., is situated approximately 12 km. to the south-southwest of the
               site of the antique and medieval city, which is known today as Old Malatya (Eski
               Malatya, officially Battalgazi).</p>
                    <p>Melitene was an important center of Christianity from early on. Meletius of Antioch
               (d. 381), who presided over the First Council of Constantinople, was a native of the
               city, while its early bishops included such figures as Otreios, present at that
               council of 381, Acacius (d. before 449), one of the fathers at Ephesus (431), Mamas
               (Momo), a renegade to the miaphysite cause who was restored to his see under Justin
               I, and Domitian (d. 602), a nephew of Emperor Maurice (582–602). The list of bishops
               for Melitene in the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael I Rabo</ref> (Chabot, <hi rend="italic">Chronique de Michel le Syrien</hi>, vol. 3, 494) indicates that
               there was a long interruption after Domitian, no doubt reflecting the absence of Syr.
               Orth. Christians in the area. The list resumes with names of four bishops whose dates
               are unknown. The fifth name on that part of the list is that of bp. Daniel, ordained
               by <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> (Patr. 818–45). From Grigorios
               onwards, who was ordained by Patr. Basilios (923–35), the titulars are styled as
               ‘metroplitans’.</p>
                    <p>Melitene and the surrounding area, lying to the north of areas traditionally
               inhabited by Syr. Christians, saw an influx of Syr. Orth. settlers in the wake of
               their reconquest by the Byzantines in 934 and especially after the adoption of a
               policy encouraging such migration by Nicephoras II Phocas (963–69), who, being unable
               to entice Chalcedonians to settle in the area, invited the Syr. Orth. Patr. Yuḥanon
               da-Srigteh (965–86) to move with his followers to the region of ‘Melitene, Hanzīṭ,
               and Qlisuro’, promising them immunity from persecution (Chabot, <hi rend="italic">Chronique de Michel le Syrien</hi>, vol. 4, 335f.). Although that promise was not
               kept for long, the wealth created through this resettlement became a major factor in
               bringing about the revival of cultural activities among Syr. Christians which has
               come to be termed the ‘<ref rend="bold">Syriac Renaissance</ref>’. Melitene played a
               central role in the ecclesiastical and cultural life of the Syr. Orth. Church during
               the following three centuries, giving birth to the most important Syr. Orth. authors
               from that period, Michael I Rabo, <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, and, probably,
                  <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>. Of the Patriarchs from the period,
               Yuḥanon bar ʿAbdun (1004–31), <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon X bar Shushan</ref> (1064–73),
               Athanasios VI bar Qeṭreh (1139–66), and <ref rend="bold">Michael II the Younger</ref>
               (1199–1215), as well as Michael I, were natives of Melitene, while Athanasios bar
               Kamoro (1090–1129), though born in <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>, was raised in Melitene,
               and Ignatius III Dawid (maph. 1215–22, Patr. 1222–52), Dionysios VI ʿAngur (1252–61),
               and Philoxenos Nemrud (1283–92) were metropolitans of Melitene before their elevation
               to the patriarchate. A large number of other authors, such as the apostate Ignatius
               (Iwanis) Marqos bar Qiqi (metr. of Melitene, then maph. 991–1016), Ignatius of
               Melitene (d. 1104), Yuḥanon Saʿīd bar Ṣabūnī (metr. in 1105), <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Wahbun</ref> (d. 1193), Grigorios Yaʿqub (maph. 1189–1214), were
               also associated with the city either as its natives or its metropolitans.</p>
                    <p>In the first half of the 11th cent., the Coptic bp. Michael of Tinnīs, reporting on
               his visit to the region, spoke of Melitene as the large city under the jurisdiction
               of Patr. Yuḥanon bar ʿAbdun, with 56 churches and 60,000 arms-bearing Christians in
               the city and its surroundings (A. S. Atiya et al., <hi rend="italic">History of the
                  Patriarchs of the Egyptian Church</hi>, vol. 2, pt. 2 [Cairo, 1948], 141f.). The
               Christians of the city included Melkites, as well as Armenians, and it may have been
               through contacts with Melkites there that the redaction of the <hi rend="italic">Qonune yawnoye</hi> designated as Melitenian was adopted by the Syr. Christians.
               The leading role Metr. Dionysios ʿAngur is reported to have played in the defence of
               the city in 1243 suggests that the Syr. Christians then constituted the majority of
               the Christians and possibly also of the overall population. One peculiarity of the
               local dialect of Aramaic, the pronunciation of <hi rend="italic">qoph</hi> as <hi rend="italic">gomal</hi>, is mentioned by Bar ʿEbroyo in his treatise ‘On
               equilitteral words’ (Martin, <hi rend="italic">Œuvres grammaticales d’Abou’lfaradj
                  dit Bar Hebreus</hi>, vol. 2, 82; cf. Duval, <hi rend="italic">Traité de grammaire
                  syriaque</hi>, xi).</p>
                    <p>The political disturbances in the latter half of the 13th cent. evidently had a
               devastating effect on the Syr. Orth. communities in Melitene and its surroundings;
               Bar ʿEbroyo, writing in 1283, says that there was ‘not one house remaining’ in the
               seven dioceses in the neighbourhood of Melitene, namely Laqabin, ʿArqo, Qlisuro,
               Gubos, Ṣemḥo, Qlawdiya, and Gargar (Abbeloos and Lamy, <hi rend="italic">Gregorii
                  Barhebraei chronicon ecclesiasticum</hi>, vol. 3, 459). One of the three claimants
               to the patriarchate in the schism following the death of Philoxenos Nemrud was
               Constantine of Melitene, who was murdered by the Kurds within a year of his
               ordination in 1293. The third in the Cilician line of patriarchs was Basilios Gabriel
               of Melitene (1349–87), while Ignatius Shihāb (1366–81), the third in the Mardin line,
               is also said to have been metropolitan of Melitene (A. Barsoum, <hi rend="italic">History of the Za’faraan Monastery</hi> [2008], 49; F. Y. Dolabani, <hi rend="italic">Maktbonuto d-faṭriyarke d-Anṭiyokiy</hi>a [1990], 186). In two lists
               drawn up in 1579/80–81 the title of the bp. of Melitene is found attached to that of
               Gargar and <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>. By the end of the 19th cent., the Christian
               population of the city consisted almost entirely of Armenians, who made up about one
               tenth of the total population of 30,000 (V.  Cuinet, <hi rend="italic">La Turquie
                  d’Asie</hi>, vol. 2 [1892], 372).</p>
                    <p>Although there was never any significant E.-Syr. presence in the region around
               Melitene, ‘bishop of Tarsus and Malatya’ is mentioned as a suffragan of <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref> in a list of Ch. of E. bishoprics found appended in an
               early 13th-cent. ms. (Vat. Arab. 157) to the canonical work of Elias of Damascus (ca.
               900) (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, vol. 2, 458f.; cf. Graf, <hi rend="italic">GCAL</hi>, vol. 2, 134).</p>

               Minor), to whom <ref rend="bold">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref> (Ecclesiastical History,
               IV, 26, 3 and 5–11) attributes, among other works, an apology addressed to the
               emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–80) remains uncertain. Eusebius’s quotations from the
               apology do not match the Syriac work. We may, therefore, be dealing with a different
               work by the same author, or with a different Meliton, or the author may have used a
               pseudonym.</p>
                    <p>The author strongly argues in favor of monotheism and rejects polytheism, which he
               sees as an outgrowth of the veneration of heroic men. Freewill enables man to
               discover the truth of the one God and to acquire eternal life. Once enlightened
               himself, the emperor is expected to lead his people out of error. At the end of time
               there will be a ‘flood of fire’ (<hi rend="italic">māmolā d-nurā</hi>) from which,
               just as from the earlier ‘flood of water’, only the righteous will be saved. In spite
               of a few biblical references, the religious message is that of monotheism, without
               any mention being made of Christianity or Judaism.</p>
                    <p>If the work indeed was an oration, the addressee may have been either Marcus Aurelius
               or Caracalla (r.  198–217), both named ‘Antoninus’, and the existence of a Greek
               original must then be assumed. However, the author may have adopted the genre of the
               apologetic oration. The work may then belong to a slightly later period and possibly
               have been written in Syriac, originating from Syria or Mesopotamia, perhaps from the
               city of Mabbug, about whose early pagan cults the author seems to have been well
               informed.</p>

               Chalcedonian, the other Syr. Orth., the former came to be designated as ‘Melkite’
               (and later also as ‘Rum Orthodox’, from <hi rend="italic">Romaios</hi> in the sense
               of ‘Byzantine’). By extension the term Melkite is sometimes also used in connection

               is retained solely with reference to the Catholic line (sometimes alongside
               ‘Greek/Byzantine Catholic’) whereas ‘Rum/Byzantine Orthodox’ is used with reference
               to the Byzantine Orthodox patriarchal line.</p>

                    <p>Melkites ceased writing in <ref rend="bold">Syriac</ref> around the 9th cent., turning
               to Arabic instead, though translations into Syriac of Greek monastic literature, and
               especially of liturgical texts continued to be made for rather longer, and Syriac
               remained a liturgical language in certain areas of Syria until the 17th cent. when
               there was a sharp decline in its use, though in a few places it continued into the
               early 18th cent. Thus only a small amount of Melkite writing in Syriac survives, and
               most of this has been preserved in mss. of the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St.
                  Catherine</ref>, Sinai. The contents fall into several different categories:</p>
                    <p>1. Theological and polemical literature from the 7th cent., both dyothelete (ed. P.
               Bettiolo, CSCO 403–4, 1979) and monothelete (such as the Life of <ref rend="bold">Maximus</ref>). What survives is probably only a very small proportion of what
               once existed. Three 7th-/8th-cent. authors, George of Martyropolis, Constantine, and
                  <ref rend="bold">Leon of Ḥarran</ref>, are known from the Letter of <ref rend="bold">Eliya</ref>, addressed to Leon; Constantine was also a translator and copyist
               (ms. Brit. Libr. Or. 8606, of 723). <ref rend="bold">Theodoros Abū Qurra</ref> (early
               9th cent.), who normally wrote in Arabic, states that he also composed a work in
               Syriac (J. C. Lamoreaux, <hi rend="italic">Theodore Abu Qurrah</hi> [2005], 119).</p>
                    <p>2. Translations of theological literature, including a letter of <ref rend="bold">Sophronius</ref> (translated by Constantine in 721; ed. M. Albert, PO 39.2,
               1978), and several homilies by Pantoleon, Anastasius, and others; a few of these were
               subsequently taken over into Syr. Orth. homiliaries.</p>
                    <p>3. Translations of Chalcedonian hagiography and monastic literature, notably <ref rend="bold">John Climacus</ref>’s Ladder and the XL Martyrs of Sinai; the ‘New
               Finds’ at St. Catherine’s Monastery, Sinai, have produced evidence of Syriac
               translations of Cyril of Scythopolis’s Lives of Sabas and Euthymios (Sinai Syr. M11
               and 13N, Fragments no. 36), and of the Life of Symeon the Younger Stylite (M15=76N);
               the last was translated in <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> in 827/8. Two further Lives,
               by Leontios of Neapolis, of Symeon the Fool and John the Almoner, transmitted in Syr.
               Orth. mss., must have originated in Melkite circles.</p>
                    <p>4. A single short 7th-cent. Melkite Chronicle survives (ed. A. de Halleux, in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>91 [1978], 5–44); either it or its source was used by some
               later Syr. Orth. chronicles.</p>
                    <p>5. A small number of monastic texts of Syr. Orth. or Ch. of E. provenance are
               transmitted in Melkite mss.; the unique ms. of <ref rend="bold">Sahdona</ref>’s ‘Book
               of Perfection’ was copied in837 specifically for St. Catherine’s Monastery. The
               monastic anthology in Sinai Syr. 14 (10th cent.) includes excerpts from a number of
               different E.-Syr. authors, in particular <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>and
                  <ref rend="bold">Shemʿon d-Ṭaybutheh</ref>. A Syriac ms. of the ‘First Part’ of
               Isḥaq’s writings survives, copied in the very Monastery of St. Sabas where it was
               subsequently translated into Greek (Sinai Syr. 24, with parts in Milan and
               Paris).</p>
                    <p>6. Liturgical texts; this constitutes by far the largest category. The oldest mss.
               sometimes still retain the original Antiochene rite, before it was altered to that of
               Constantinople, a process which probably took place over the 10th–11th cent. and
               during the period of the Byzantine reconquest of northwest Syria (968–1089). This
               change of rite involved the major undertaking of translating into Syriac (and Arabic)
               all the various Greek liturgical books that had developed by the end of the first
               millennium; the course of this massive enterprise still remains to be properly
               charted. Earlier, and perhaps already in the 8th cent. a considerable amount of
               Palestinian hymnography was translated, including canons by <ref rend="bold">John of
                  Damascus</ref>, Cosmas of Jerusalem, and others. From about the 13th cent. onwards
               many of the Syriac liturgical mss. also contain a good deal of Arabic as well.</p>
                    <p>7. For the small amount that survives of <ref rend="bold">Christian Palestinian
                  Aramaic</ref> literature, all Melkite, see that entry.</p>
                    <p>Almost all Melkite literature in Syriac was produced in western Syria, and important
               centers for its transmission were monasteries on the Black Mountain, northwest of
               Antioch, the region of the Kalamun, in particular <ref rend="bold">Qara</ref>, and
               Ṣaydnāyā. Melkite copyists at St. Catherine’s Monastery (particularly active in the
               13th cent.) were mostly from these locations. By the 13th cent. a distinctive Melkite
               form of Syriac script had developed.</p>

                    <note type="abstract">A collection of Syriac sentences attributed to ‘Menander the Wise’, probably the
            Greek comedian (d. 292/1 BC) under whose name circulated Greek monostichs (ed. Jaekel),
            many of which were not original to Menander.<note/>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>A collection of Syriac sentences attributed to ‘Menander the Wise’, probably the
               Greek comedian (d. 292/1 BC) under whose name circulated Greek monostichs (ed.
               Jaekel), many of which were not original to Menander. The Syriac sentences are
               preserved in the 7th-cent. ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,658 (ed. Land; corrections
               by Wright) which contains also various philosophical treatises and gnomologia (cf.
               Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue … British Museum</hi>, vol. 3, 1154–60). An
               epitome of the collection exists in London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,614 (ed. Sachau).</p>
                    <p> Scholars have differently divided the collection into individual sayings, ranging in
               number from 96 (Audet) to 153 (Baumstark; Schulthess has 101, Riessler 103). More
               recently, the sayings have been cited according to line number (Baarda counts 474
               lines). The literary form of the sentences varies: there are indicative and
               imperative maxims as well as longer sections of moral advice. Noteworthy is the
               dialogue scene between Homer and his friends (ed. Land, 66.8–15; tr. Baarda, lines
               78–93).</p>
                    <p>The Syriac sentences of Menander are addressed to a well-situated man of the upper
               class of society. They contain practical advice on how to live a happy, prosperous,
               and peaceful life, addressing themes such as the fear of God, respect for parents and
               elders, raising of children, choice of a wife, moderate consumption of food and
               drink, treatment of servants, warnings not to commit adultery, proper behavior as a
               guest, and friendship. The thematic structure of the Syriac Menander is loose; Kirk
               has argued that the collection is organized along the major stages of a life, from
               birth through adulthood and old age to death.</p>
                    <p>The Syriac text probably is a translation from the Greek (Land; Baumstark, 473f.;
               Schulthess, 201; Küchler, 316; Baarda, 584), the original of which is no longer
               extant. Frankenberg’s thesis of a Hebrew original has been widely rejected.</p>
                    <p>The question of the author’s cultural context is still being debated: the Syriac
               Menander bears resemblances both to Jewish wisdom literature (especially Proverbs,
               Jesus Sirach, <ref rend="bold">Aḥiqar</ref>, Pseudo-Phocylides) and to Greek wisdom
               traditions (some Syriac sentences have a parallel in the Greek monostichs); the
               Syriac collection thus is part of an ‘international wisdom tradition’ (Schulthess,
               201). Several earlier scholars stressed the Greek affinities (Renan, Land, Baumstark,
               Schulthess), whereas others argued for a Jewish authorship (Frankenberg, Riessler,
               Kirk). Problematic for a Jewish authorship remains a passage which warns against
               table fellowship with (pagan) priests (Land, 69,17–24; tr. Baarda, lines 262–77),
               implying a polytheistic background of the author. The text’s classification as a
               Jewish pseudepigraphon has been challenged (Schmid and Stählin, 623; Schürer, 693),
               but has recently been upheld by Baarda and Kirk. Audet argued for an Egyptian
               provenance; his thesis was followed by Küchler, but rejected by Baarda.</p>
                    <p>Concerning the date of composition, there is a consensus that the sentences date to
               the Roman period. An allusion to the law that a master may not kill his slave (Land,
               67,21f.; tr. Baarda, line 159), first stipulated by Hadrian, suggests a date after
               the middle of the 1st cent. A reference to the schools of gladiators (Land, 65,13–15;
               tr. Baarda lines 34–33) implies as <hi rend="italic">terminus ante quem</hi> ca. 400,
               since after Constantine’s legislation against gladiatorial games in 325 (Cod. Theod.
               15.12.1) the schools gradually disappeared (cf. Audet, 77f.). Moreover, a reference
               to crucifixion as punishment for theft (Land, 70,8; tr. Baarda line 295) suggests a
               date before Constantine’s prohibition of this form of punishment. Hence most scholars
               date the collection to the 3rd cent. However, the date of the Syriac translation
               remains uncertain.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Influential Apocalyptic work of the late 7th cent. Composed in Syriac and ascribed to
               bp. Methodius of Olympus (martyred in 312), this apocalyptic survey of world history
               was clearly composed in the late 7th cent., in response to the rise of Islam.
               Formerly dated to earlier in the 7th cent., it is now thought to date from about 692,
               during the reign of ʿAbd al-Malik (685–705). The first 7 chapters cover the period up
               to the rebuilding of the Temple in 538 BC; beside the biblical text, these draw on
               traditions in the <ref rend="bold">Cave of Treasures</ref>. Alexander the Great is then
               introduced, in connection with Gog and Magog, and he is linked by a remarkable
               genealogy to the royal lineage of Ethiopia, as well as to that of Rome and Byzantium;
               the aim of this is to explain Ps. 68:31, ‘Kush will surrender to God’, which is taken
               to refer to the final Byzantine emperor, who will surrender his kingdom to God after
               the appearance of the Son of Perdition (a motif borrowed from the <ref rend="bold">Julian Romance</ref>). The Apocalypse was soon translated into Greek and then
               into Latin, where it proved very influential, especially in the Medieval West. The
               earliest forms of the Greek and Latin are re-edited by W. J. Aerts and G. A. A.
               Kortekaas (CSCO 569–70; 1998). There is a related fragmentary apocalyptic text
               associated with <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (ed. F. Nau, in <hi rend="italic">JA

                    <p>Patr. and historian, most notably author of a World Chronicle. Michael I Rabo
               (1126–99) was a distinguished Patr. and a dominant figure in the intellectual history
               of the Syr. Orth. Church during the 12th cent. He was renowned for his intrepid
               diplomacy, his rigorous legislation, and sanctions in order to reform the Syr. Orth.
               ecclesiastical administration as a means to enhance Christian autonomy. Michael was
               born in 1126 in a still largely Christian <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref>, where Greeks
               as well as Syr. Orth. and Armenians lived side by side with Muslims. Being a member
               of a clerical family, Michael was sent to the nearby <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor
                  Barṣawmo</ref> for education. He stayed on as a monk and prior. In the year 1166
               Michael was elected patr. of the Syr. Orth. Church under the pressure of a reform
               party among the bishops. In order to ensure his and his flock’s interests and freedom
               of action Michael balanced out his relations with the warring parties in the area of
               his jurisdiction. Especially in the first half of his patriarchate his authority was
               felt and sought within the entire group of non-Chalcedonian churches, Copts and
               Armenians included. Michael was accepted as a frequent visitor in Latin <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> with the consent of the Byzantine emperor Manuel Komnenos
               (1143–80) in spite of the opposition of the Greek-orthodox community. In Antioch he
               was the first Syr. Orth. Patr. after the expulsion of <ref rend="bold">Severus of
                  Antioch</ref> (in 518) to act as patr. there and to consecrate a number of
               bishops. He also visited <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> several times. Michael was
               invited to take part in the third Lateran Council in 1179, but declined.</p>
                    <p>The second half of his patriarchate was overshadowed by the election of an
               anti-patriarch, named <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Wahbun</ref>(d. 1193) in 1180, who
               was supported by the Latins in the Crusader States as well as by the Armenian Cath.
               Gregory IV (1173–93). Apart from a rapprochement between Michael and the Seljuk
               Sultan Qilij Arslan II (1155–92), this led to some temporary diplomatic isolation
               until 1193, when Michael was fully recognized again by his church as well as by his
               Christian neighbors. Michael was buried in his newly-built church in Mor
               Barṣawmo.</p>
                    <p>Michael’s writing was largely concentrated on the reform project. Parallel to his
               numerous obligations as a patr., he collected mss. of theological and historical
               content and restored and compiled hagiographical and liturgical works. His canonistic
               work is partly conserved in later collections, but the greater part is lost, as is
               his treatise on dualist heresies composed for the Lateran Council. He also composed
               some liturgical and hagiographical works and collected ancient theological and
               historical sources.</p>
                    <p>These he used for his monumental world chronicle from the origin of the world to
               1195. Michael’s chronicle has been studied intensively since its edition and
               translation by J.-B Chabot. Inspired by the works of bp. <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of
                  Edessa</ref> (d. 708) and Patr. <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref>
               (d. 845), Michael’s chronicle blended both Eusebian genres, the chronological tables
               and the narrative ecclesiastical history. Michael used chronographies and
               ecclesiastical histories as sources and added further material. Only part of these he
               had directly before his eyes; others he used through intermediaries, as he reveals
               himself. Michael related his own time from a well informed and independent point of
               view. In view of source-critical methods and the universality of the chronological
               scope the highest standard in Syr. Orth. chronography was reached with this
               chronicle. Michael intended his work for learned clerical readers with access to a
               well-stocked library.</p>
                    <p>The text is not preserved in its entirety, and the layout of Michael’s chronicle was
               distorted through the process of copying. Chabot’s edition is a facsimile of a
               documentary copy written for him in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (Urfa) from 1897 to
               1899. While the scribes tried to imitate the layout, a number of mistakes were
               introduced. Its <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi>, the only extant ms., was written in
               1598 by a very competent scribe. It is kept by the community of the Edessenians in
                  <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>. In view of the loss of the original, this beautiful
               manuscript is the best witness for the layout of the chronicle. Fortunately it will
               soon be made available in print. This ms. was probably the <hi rend="italic">Vorlage</hi> for an Arabic translation, which also sought to preserve some of the
               visual features, while changing others. The Arabic translation has much the same
               lacunae as the Syriac text. By comparing his version with the Arabic translation
               preserved in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Or. 4402 (which is one of several Arabic
               copies), Chabot detected some details lost in the Syriac text. No further research
               has been done so far on this problem.</p>
                    <p>The historical material was originally organized in four columns, the first being
               designated as the ‘succession of the patriarchs’, the second as ‘succession of the
               kings’, the chronological canon as ‘computation of the years’. No title of the
               additional column, which contains mixed material, is now known. Chapters with
               excursus were inserted, which interrupted the system of columns. After an open and
               abrupt end, six appendices follow. The first appendix is a monumental synopsis of all
               the kings and patriarchs mentioned. It was supposed to function as a directory. The
               second appendix is a treatise on the historical identity of the Syrians, who are
               connected to the Ancient Oriental Empires, the Assyrians, the Babylonians, and the
                  <ref rend="bold">Arameans</ref>. When the chronicle was translated into Armenian, in
               two different translations, in 1246 and 1247, it was transformed according to
               Armenian interests.</p>
                    <p>Michael’s chronicle was motivated by a strong cognitive interest in historical and
               chronological knowledge. It also examines the historical role of the Syr. Orth. as a
               cultural-ethnic group as well as a church on the one hand with respect to God’s plan
               of salvation and on the other the universal reality of historical change and
               contingency.</p>

                    <p>Patr. of the Syr. Orth. Church (1199–1215). Michael was called Younger (<hi rend="italic">Zʿuro</hi>) by <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> in the latter’s
               Ecclesiastical History, in order to differentiate him from his namesake and uncle
                  <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> (i.e. the Elder), Patr. 1166–1199. Michael’s
               name before the accession was Yeshuʿ Sephtono.</p>
                    <p>Michael came from a family of <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref> which was very
               influential in ecclesiastical politics. His other uncle, Ṣliba, was archbishop of
                  <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> (1177), and later of <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>
               (1184), ordained for both dioceses by Michael the Patr. The name of Michael’s father
               was Abraham (<ref rend="bold">Chronicle of 1234</ref>, 339/252), whose other son, i.e.
               Michael’s brother Yaʿqub, was ordained, again by his uncle the patr., the <ref rend="bold">maphrian</ref> 1189–1214; at the accession also he changed his name to
               Grigorios I.</p>
                    <p>Michael was a monk in <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref>. He wanted to become
               Patr. directly after his uncle’s death, and in order to play a more active role in
               the process of election he left his monastery, while the abbot followed him and tried
               to bring him back to the monastery. However due to Michael’s machinations the abbot
               was arrested by the governor of Gargar, and released under the condition that he
               would not disturb Michael any longer (Bar ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, 607).</p>
                    <p>Michael received his patriarchal ordination at the hand of his brother, the maphrian,
               in the Monastery of Mar Ḥenanya. It was on that occasion that he changed his name to
               ‘Michael’ so that something of his uncle’s luck would be bestowed on him (Bar
               ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, 611). He quickly ordained three bishops thus
               creating his own supporters. The inhabitants of Mardin paid a bribe to the governor
               of the city that he might expel him, together with his brother (Bar ʿEbroyo,
               Ecclesiastical History, 611). He left the city and after some attempts to find a city
               to exercise his authority he withdrew to his parents’ house in Melitene. For all the
               time of his pontificate (as an antipatriarch) Michael was in opposition to Patr.
               Athanasios IX (1199–1207).</p>
                    <p>According to the anonymous author of the ‘<ref rend="bold">Chronicle of 1234</ref>’
               (253, 260), who, however, regarded Athanasios as illegitimate&#160;(‘Chronicle of1234’,
               340/254), by January 1204 (‘Chronicle of1234’, 340/253) Athanasios was recognized in
               Syria, the Sultanate of Rum, and <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, whereas Michael was
               recognized in the East in the dioceses of <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, Khabur, and Mardin. Both patriarchs
               used money and gifts for governors as means of promoting their cause.</p>
                    <p>After Athanasios’ death in 1207, the new patriarch became Yuḥanon XIV (1208–20), and
               Michael’s schism continued now against Yuḥanon. According to Bar ʿEbroyo Michael does
               not seem to have ever gained much popularity among the laity either and was
               criticised even by the members of his own family.</p>
                    <p>Michael died in 1215, 40 days after his brother, the maphrian Grigorios I, who had
               always supported him (Bar ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, 633).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Syriac author and exegete; <hi rend="italic">bādoqā</hi> (‘scholar’) and <hi rend="italic">mallpānā</hi> (‘teacher’) at the <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis
               </ref>during <ref rend="bold">Ḥenana</ref>’s tenure as its head (572–610). During the
               time of growing opposition to Ḥenana, Michael, along with many other scholars, left
               the School. Little is known about his life and his works. Among the writings
               attributed to him, the following are deemed authentic:</p>
                    <p>1. A <hi rend="italic">drāšā</hi> (‘dispute’) of Christological content, partly
               preserved, in which Michael, employing a pithy and syllogistic style, condemns the
               term <hi rend="italic">theotokos</hi> and attacks Cyrillians, Severians, and
               Julianists (ed. Abramowski and Goodman).</p>
                    <p>2. A ‘Book of Questions’ (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-šuʾʾāle</hi>), of which an
               excerpt is preserved in <ref rend="bold">Shlemon of Baṣra</ref>’s ‘Book of the Bee’. In
               this fragment Michael argues against the idea that the world will pass away before
               the resurrection of the dead. It has generally been assumed that this ‘Book of
               Questions’ is identical with the ‘Questions on the Text of Scripture’ in three
               volumes, the only work that <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>attributes to
               Michael. If this identification is correct, it is in all likelihood this book that
               was known to later exegetes, who quote a number of passages under Michael’s name
               (esp. the author of the Diyarbakır Commentary, <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>,
               and the author of the <ref rend="bold">Gannat Bussāme).</ref>
                    </p>
                    <p>3. A different ‘Book of Questions’, from which only one question, on the theme of
               ‘Man as microcosm’, is still extant (unpublished; see Reinink 2007). It appears that
               this second ‘Book of Questions’ should not be identified with the previous one, since
               it specifically focuses on ‘the refutation of heresies and cults’ (Reinink 2007,
               2008).</p>
                    <p>In addition, a ‘Book of Definitions’ (ed. Furlani) is attributed to Michael, but its
               spuriousness has been proven (see now Abramowski 1999). A text ‘On Dreams’, which has
               been transmitted as a separate work of Michael’s, turns out to be taken from this
               ‘Book of Definitions’, and therefore should no longer be regarded as his. Finally, an
               aetiological writing (<hi rend="italic">ʿelltā</hi>) on the ‘Commemoration of the
               Blessed Lady Mary, the Bearer of Christ’ (unpublished), assigned in the mss. to ‘one
               of the brethren <hi rend="italic">badoqe</hi> of the School of Nisibis’, has
               sometimes been considered Michael’s (already by <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq Qardaḥe
                  Shbadnaya</ref>). This attribution cannot, however, be substantiated (see Vööbus,
               Reinink 2008).</p>

                    <p>Principal town of <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, situated at the geographical
               center of the region where the main east-west road from <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>
               to Gozarto (Cizre) and the north-south road from Ḥesno d-Kifo (Hasankeyf) to <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> meet. The name of the town can be traced back to that of
               ‘Matiāte’, which Ashurnasirpal II passed on a campaign in 879 BC. Under the Ottomans,
               Midyat became the administrative center of a subdistrict (<hi rend="italic">nahiye</hi>, later <hi rend="italic">kaza</hi>) covering the central part of Ṭur
               ʿAbdin and it is today the administrative center of a district (<hi rend="italic">ilçe</hi>) within the province of Mardin. The municipality of Midyat today
               includes the traditionally Christian township of Midyat proper and Muslim Estel ca. 3
               km. to the west.</p>
                    <p>An early ascetic associated with Midyat is the stylite Abel (Hobil, end of 5th
               cent.), who, according to the ‘Life of Samuel of Qarṭmin’, received a visit while on
               his pillar from young <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>. The monastery built
               on the site of Abel’s pillar and originally known by his name came to be better known
               under the name of Mor Abrohom after the relics of Abraham of the High Mountain (<hi rend="italic">Ṭuro d-Rom</hi>), the teacher of <ref rend="bold">Barṣawmo</ref>, were
               brought there and housed in a larger church built next to that of Abel. According to
               the ‘Life of Philoxenos of Mabbug’, Philoxenos’s head was brought to Midyat after
               Mabbug had been taken by the Arabs and housed in a church built for the purpose, but
               was transferred to the Monastery of Mor Abrohom after its desecration in a raid on
               the town in 1145.</p>
                    <p>A bishopric specifically for Midyat is first mentioned as one of the six sees that
               separated to form the patriarchate of Ṭur ʿAbdin in the schism of 1364. Of the five
               patriarchs of Ṭur ʿAbdin between 1584 and 1791, four were from Midyat. Since 1923,
               Midyat has been the seat of the bishops of Ṭur ʿAbdin along with the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Tfinkdji reported in 1914 that in a total population of 8,000, there were 6,000 Syr.
               Orth., 450 Protestants, and about 100 each of Syr. Catholics and Chaldeans. Midyat
               lost a large part of its population in the <ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref>, but until the
               1960s Christians continued to constitute the majority of the population. In 2005,
               there were reported to be ca. 100 Christian families in a total population of over
               50,000.</p>
                    <p>The churches within the township are: 1. Mort Shmuni (Syr. Orth. cathedral); 2. Mor
               Barṣawmo (near center of town, rebuilt in 1943); 3. Mor Aksnoyo (i.e. Philoxenos of
               Mabbug, at eastern edge of town, rebuilt in 1960s); 4. Yoldat Aloho (‘little church’,
               to the south of town); 5. Mor Sharbel (in northern part of town, 1950s); and 6.
               Yoldat Aloho (north of Mor Sharbel, Protestant, 1900). In the immediate vicinity of
               the town are the former Monastery of Mor Sharbel to the north of the town (now
               military base) and the Monastery of Mor Abrohom (w-Hobil), ca. 1 km. east of the
               town, with churches dedicated to Mor Abel, Mor Abrohom, and Yoldat Aloho. Among the
               ms. treasures of Midyat is the illuminated Gospel lectionary of 1227.</p>

                    <p>He was born in Sharansh al-ʿUlya near Zakho and named Hurmiz. His father Paul was a
               priest. Mingana joined the <ref rend="bold">Seminary of St. John</ref> in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> in 1891, where he studied Syriac under <ref rend="bold">Awgen
                  Manna</ref> and later succeeded him, when the latter became bp. in 1902. Mingana
               continued teaching there until 1908. Mingana was ordained a priest in 1902 by Patr.
               Emmanuel Toma, and adopted the name Alphonse. Mingana traveled in the area collecting
               mss. He managed to collect 70 mss. 20 of which were on parchment, but they all
               perished in World War I. Mingana worked as copy-editor at the Dominican Press from
               1903–10. In 1907, Mingana published the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref> (in
               his <hi rend="italic">Sources syriaques</hi>, I) which has caused much controversy.
               Apparently, Mingana had a scribe make the ms. on whose authority he published the
               text look as if it belonged to the 10th cent., though it was done at his time. This
               publication also put him at odds with his Patr. and he was asked to leave the
               seminary. In 1913, armed only with the address of <ref rend="bold">James Rendel
                  Harris</ref>, he left the East to live in Birmingham, UK. There he first worked
               with Rendel Harris on the <ref rend="bold">Odes of Solomon</ref>, and later with <ref rend="bold">Agnes Smith Lewis</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Margaret Dunlop Gibson
               </ref>on Islamic texts. Between 1915 and 1924, he was appointed to catalog the Arabic
               mss. of the John Rylands Library, and then between 1924 and 1929 he undertook three
               expeditions to the east collecting Syriac and Arabic (both Christian and Islamic)
               mss., which would become the Mingana Collection at Selly Oak Colleges. Mingana then
               turned his attention to cataloguing his collection (3  vols.; 1933–39), and began
               publishing some of its texts in the series Woodbrooke Studies. Seven volumes appeared
               in the series.</p>

                    <p>Professor of Near-Eastern languages at Lund University, Sweden, 1908–37, and Vice
               Chancellor of the same university, 1926–36. In his research, Moberg dedicated himself
               mainly to Syriac and Arabic. He started his career under the mentorship of K. V.
               Zetterstéen at Uppsala University and submitted an edition of an Arabic Mamluk text
               as his doctoral dissertation in 1902. Throughout his career, Moberg continued to work
               on Arabic materials. He also translated classical and popular Arabic literature into
               Swedish and was known as a distinguished lecturer. His main scholarly contributions,
               however, were in the field of Syriac. With his research on the Syriac grammar of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> and on ‘The Book of the Ḥimyarites’ (see <ref rend="bold">Ḥimyar</ref>), he became famous as a Syriac scholar whose achievements
               continue to play a role in contemporary Syriac scholarship.</p>
                    <p>One of Moberg’s main contributions was his study of the Syriac grammar of Bar
               ʿEbroyo. Between 1907 and 1913 he translated the text into German along with
               text-critical notes (2 vols.). In 1922, he expanded his studies in this field by
               producing a complete critical edition of the Syriac text based on a wide range of
               mss. Bar ʿEbroyo’s grammar is a pioneering work in which the author seeks to
               regenerate Syriac grammar by using the methods and the terminology of the classical
               Arabic grammarians.</p>
                    <p>In the spring of 1920, Moberg was asked to examine a Syriac ms. containing a
               collection of well-known liturgies. More interesting were the fragments in the boards
               of the volume that consisted of portions of much older mss. Having taken out,
               cleaned, and treated the leaves in the boards of the ms., Moberg discovered that most
               of them belonged to a work on the Ḥimyarite martyrs of <ref rend="bold">Nagran</ref>.
               In 1924, Moberg published an edition, translation, and study of these fragments,
               which shed new light on the history of South Arabia in the 6th cent. This study is
               the one most connected to Moberg’s name and the one that has had the most lasting
               influence on other scholarly research.</p>

                    <p>Institutionalized form of religious life, devoted to disciplined ascetic prayer
               practice. An ascetic form of Christian living, including vows of celibacy and poverty
               (or simplicity) in service of the church, had characterized early Syriac Christianity
               by the 2nd or 3rd cent. During the 4th cent., as for Christians elsewhere, this type
               of religious vocation began to organize in desert and wilderness areas apart from
               urban contexts. <ref rend="bold">Yulyana Saba</ref> (d. 367) was one of the first to
               establish a community of disciples in the desert of Osrhoene. By the 5th cent.,
               varieties of monasticism were flourishing in the Syrian Orient, and documents
               containing monastic rules indicate the efforts to institutionalize and order these
               under the supervision of bishops. In Syrian tradition, a ‘monastery’ was a community
               of two or more individuals pursuing a life of prayer. Individual hermits or ascetics
               were often loosely connected to monasteries, which then provided for their needs.
               Sometimes monasteries became very large and assumed roles such as landowners or
               providing schools. They were often centers of learning for both men and women and
               contained important ms. collections. Rich traditions of mysticism and prayer devotion
               flourished in late antique and medieval E. and W. Syr. monasteries. Syr. monasticism
               was notable for its close engagement with civic life (villages, towns, cities), and
               for constant, intimate interaction with lay people of every kind — a characteristic
               still apparent in the monasteries of <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> in eastern
               Turkey, or the Monastery of Mor Ephrem in Glane-Losser, Holland.</p>

                    <p>City in the north of Iraq, on the west bank of the Tigris opposite the ruins of
               ancient <ref rend="bold">Nineveh</ref>. Its Arabic name <hi rend="italic">al-Mawṣil</hi> means ‘the link’, possibly on account of its strategic location on
               a trade route linking southern Iraq with Syria and Anatolia. Before the Arab era, the
               site of Mosul was occupied by a modest fortress called in Syriac sources <hi rend="italic">ḥesnā ʿebrāyā</hi> ‘Across-the-Fortress’, near which a ‘Ninevite’
               monk named Ishoʿyahb bar Qusri built a monastery at the end of the 6th cent. His name
               still survives in the form Eshaʿya, lit. ‘Isaiah’, though the modern church that
               bears this name is from a later period. Other names were given to this pre-Islamic
               settlement, including Nu-Ardashir, Bu-Ardashir, or simply Ardashir. In 637 the Arab
               armies conquered Mosul which became part of the province of al-Jazīra, the capital of
               which was <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref>. At the time of the Arab conquest, the city was
               inhabited by a large E.-Syr. community and by a smaller Syr. Orth. one under the
               influence of <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>. The E.-Syr. diocese of Nineveh,
               which may well have been situated in the ruins of the ancient Assyrian palace area,
               moved to Mosul soon after its conquest; its first bp. was none other than <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> of <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref> who became Patr. in
               649. During the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, Mosul was of prime importance, being a
               trade, commercial, and agricultural center, and the city prospered in people and
               buildings. From 1127 to 1233, the city was ruled by the Atabeg Dynasty founded by
               ʿImād-al-dīn Zangī, and the time of the governor and then Sultan of Mosul Badr al-dīn
               Luʾluʾ (1199–1259) was a golden age of art and architecture, reflected in both
               Islamic and Christian religious buildings. The city was sacked by the Mongols in
               1258, and in 1534 it became part of the Ottoman empire. In 1743 the Persian
               Nadir-Shah Tahmasp invaded northern Mesopotamia as a consequence of tense relations
               between Persia and the Ottomans and besieged Mosul for nine consecutive days. The
               heroic resistance of the population, both Muslim and Christian, defeated the enemy,
               and as a consequence, these were allowed to rebuild their churches and mosques in
               Mosul and in the surrounding villages. The brilliant art and architecture reflected
               in dozens of these buildings has survived to this day and is typical of this era
               called Jalīlī, after the name of its brave governor Husayn Beg al-Jalīlī. During the
               19th and early 20th cent., the Christians of Mosul greatly contributed to the revival
               of the Arab culture undermined for centuries by the Ottomans, creating the first
               newspaper and theater, and printing popular books through which they promoted the
               Arabic language and literature. After the invasion of Iraq by the Allied forces in
               2003, the Christians of Mosul became targets of assassination, kidnapping, and
               extortion, and the city’s Chald. bp., two of its priests, and many of its deacons and
               lay people fell victim to the violence.</p>

                    <p>Born in Batḥa, near Ghosṭa, in Lebanon, Mubārak was sent to the Maronite College in
               Rome at a very young age, in 1672. After his studies, he returned to Lebanon in 1685,
               and was ordained a priest by Patr. <ref rend="bold">Isṭifān al-Duwayhī</ref> in 1687.
               During a second stay in Rome, on behalf of the Maronite Church, he established
               contact with Cosimo III, the Duke of Tuscany, who in 1698 appointed him to the chair
               of Oriental languages at the University of Pisa. He resigned from the university in
               1707 and entered into the Jesuit order, which brought him back to Rome. In 1730, at
               the request of Cardinal Querini, he started working on the so-called ‘Roman’ edition
               of <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>’s works. To this project <ref rend="bold">J. S.
                  Assemani</ref> contributed Ephrem’s Greek works, with Latin translations (in 3
               vols.: 1732, 1743, and 1746), while Mubārak was in charge of the Syriac, again with
               Latin translations. The first two volumes appeared in 1737 and 1740. After Mubārak’s
               death, the third Syriac volume was seen through the press by <ref rend="bold">S. E.
                  Assemani</ref> (1743). This posthumous volume contains, among other things, the

                    <p>The Monastery of Moses the Ethiopian is perched on top of a steep, rocky promontory
               that juts out of a deep gully between two cliffs in the high region south of Nabk.
               The earliest historical reference to the monastery is in a hand-written note beside a
               text of <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref> on the Gospel of Matthew, in a 6th-cent.
               ms. preserved in the British Library. A second note in the same ms. states that this
               volume was ‘the property of the convent of Mushe, on the hill called “the Great
               Head,” east of Natpha, in the province of Damascus’. The subsequent history of the
               monastery is closely documented by numerous inscriptions within the church, and by
               mss. that once belonged to its flourishing scriptorium. Until the end of the 14th
               cent. it was the seat of a bishopric that later fell under the jurisdiction of Ḥama
               and <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>, and then under the bishopric of <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref> (Kaufhold).</p>
                    <p>The monastery prospered well into the 18th cent. and was recorded by both Burton and
               Moritz late in the 19th cent., but some time thereafter was totally abandoned and
               fell into ruin. The fortress-like building was approached through a small door on the
               top floor, from where it was built four stories down; but when discovered again in
               1981, the lower floors had all caved in and the upper terrace had only one room that
               sheltered sheep. At that time the chapel was still preserved, its walls decorated
               with falling, painted stucco but the roof and the ciborium were gone, burned for
               firewood. A young Jesuit, Father Paolo dall’Oglio, an Orientalist by training,
               visited the site and decided to restore the monastery to its former state. With great
               care to reproduce its original plan and accoutrements, and with the help of local
               teams of Christian volunteers from Syria and Iraq, with experts in the Department of
               Antiquities in Damascus, and the Istituto del Restauro in Rome, Father Paolo cleared
               the lower rooms and rebuilt the upper stories and the chapel. In subsequent years he
               dug a well, added outlying buildings, and established a new order for the monastery.
               He now presides over a small group of monks, nuns, and novitiates in a religious
               center dedicated to serving the surrounding community of Christians and Muslims and
               to promoting a dialogue between them. The monastery receives daily a great number of
               visitors, both Christian and Muslim.</p>
                    <p>For as long as the inhabitants of Nabk can remember, the monastery has been known as
               Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī (St. Moses the Ethiopian), but, according to the inscriptions and
               to the mss., it was originally dedicated to Mār Mūsā the Prophet (St. Moses the
               Prophet). The earliest reference to Moses the Ethiopian comes from the 17th cent. It
               is possible that this saint became associated with the monastery on the arrival of a
               number of Abyssinian monks in the 15th cent. (Cruikshank Dodd). These monks from Mar
               Girgios al-Ḥabash, in Ehden, and Mar Yaʿqub al-Ḥabash in Bsharre, were evicted from
               the Qadisha valley by the Maronites in 1488. In this case the change of name from Mār
               Mūsā, to Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabash (of the Ethiopians), to Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashi (the
               Ethiopian) might have come about naturally in the process of time. A hand encased in
               a silver casket purporting to be the hand of Mar Moses the Ethiopian is inscribed as
               a donation to the monastery by Bp. Eliya in 1817 and is now preserved in the Church
               of the Virgin, in Nabk. The Syr. Orth. Christians of Nabk celebrate the feast of
               Moses the Ethiopian on 28 Aug. In the Greek Church his feast day is 18 June.</p>
                    <p>The various stages in the monastery’s long history are recorded in inscriptions.
               Those carved in the building stones indicate that the church was rebuilt and
               renovated in A.H. 504 (= AD 1058/1059). Subsequently, it was enlarged and turned into
               a fortress in the 15th cent. and restored again in the 16th. Inscriptions painted on
               the wall paintings identify the figures and scenes. Earlier layers of painting are
               inscribed in Greek, whereas the top layer for the most part uses Syriac. There are
               also dedications and memorials written on the paintings themselves by various
               visitors to the monastery, in Syriac and in Arabic, that contribute to the history of
               the monastery (Tweir, Haddad, Muwazzin, ter Haar Romeny et al).</p>
                    <p>With this long and fascinating history, the chapel in Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī also
               preserves until today the most extensive series of paintings to have come down to us
               from the whole of the Levant (Cruikshank Dodd, Dall’Oglio, Westphalen, Immerzeel).
               The chapel is unique in that it shows a well-documented, coherent series of paintings
               from more than one period, paintings that are indispensable for the study of medieval
               Christian art.</p>
                    <p>There are three (or three and a half) principal layers of painting, applied at three
               different periods (Westphalen). The first, or earliest layer of paintings (layer 1),
               can be dated to the 11th cent. ca. 1060, soon after the first renovations to the
               church, to which more wall paintings were added a few years later (1a), at some time
               before 1095. Another layer (2) is dated by an inscription on the Baptismal scene to
               1095. The latest series (3) is the most extensive and best preserved. The date of the
               third layer is recorded in an inscription over a painting of the Evangelist Matthew,
               and it may be read as either 1192 (assuming that the Seleucid calendar is followed),
               or 1208/9 (if it is taken as a Hijra year), a distinction which is, unfortunately,
               not clear in the original.</p>
                    <p>The interior of the chapel was elaborately painted when it was first restored in
               1058/9. Beneath the more recent remains of the third layer, there is a bust of Christ
               on the triumphal arch with what appear to be archangels at either side. Above these
               figures there may have been painted the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste (Immerzeel). An
               Annunciation was placed on either side of the window. The riding saints, Theodore and
               George, appear opposite each other on the spandrels of the arches in the nave, where
               also the remains of a second pair may be traced from this early date. Still in the
               nave, on the southern spandrel nearest to the apse is the Ascension of Elijah in his
               Chariot. In the southern aisle, west end, an early representation of the Presentation
               in the Temple (?) is balanced by a group of apostles, probably the Pentecost, at the
               west end of the northern aisle. In the southern aisle, an image of Samson and the
               Lion is painted high above the western arch. At the east end, there may have been an
               early Baptism in the northern aisle and an early Myrophores (Three Women at the Tomb)
               in the southern aisle. The columns and the soffits of the arches are decorated with
               standing saints and martyrs, both male and female most of whom were added shortly
               after this first layer (period 1a).</p>
                    <p>Layer 2 (1095) comprises a large Baptism, painted over the earlier Baptism at the
               eastern end of the northern aisle, and a renewed Myrophores painted over the earlier
               one in the southern aisle. A stylite Saint (<ref rend="bold">Shemʿun the
               Stylite</ref>?) stands beside the Baptism. At the western end of the southern aisle
               is a renewed Presentation in the Temple.</p>
                    <p>Most of the extant paintings belong to layer three, the last layer of paint, 1192 or
               1208/9. They present the most coherent series of paintings to have come down to us in
               the Syriac churches. The triumphal arch, high up under the eaves, is decorated with
               Christ Emmanuel and an Annunciation, below which is the Christ Pantocrator between
               the figures of twelve standing apostles that spill into the nave. In the apse was a
               Deesis (now largely destroyed) with the Christ on a throne surrounded by the four
               beasts of the Apocalypse. Below them, in the bema, the standing Virgin Blachernitissa
               between standing Church Fathers: <ref rend="bold">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Basil</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Athanasius</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">John
                  Chrysostom</ref>, on her right.; and <ref rend="bold">Ignatius</ref>, James, and two
               others (destroyed) on her left. On the iconastasis there are painted the five wise
               and five foolish virgins. Four large riding horsemen, George and Theodore, Bacchos
               and Sergios charge down the nave, above the arches, towards the apse. The remains of
               two other riding saints are visible nearer the apse, making six in all. Four
               evangelists writing their gospels fill the spandrels. On the western wall is a great
               Last Judgment above which is the <hi rend="italic">Traditio clavium</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Traditio Legis</hi>, of which only the lower part of Peter and Paul
               remain. Below them the remaining ten Apostles are seated on either side of a
               Hetoimasia between Adam and Eve. On the one side, below the apostles, are the three
               patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, together with Mary, holding bunches of souls in
               their laps. Beneath them are the saints, martyrs and holy men ascending from their
               tombs to heaven at the blast of trumpeting angels. On the other side of the
               Hetoimasia stand heretical bishops and various groups of enemies of the orthodox
               churches, along with Satan seated among souls drowning in the waters of the Styx, a
               devil holding down the scales, and below them are naked women symbolizing the seven
               sins. The Last Judgment spills over onto the walls of the nave.</p>
                    <p>Among these impressive scenes, the walls and the piers in Mār Mūsā are painted with
               numerous figures of standing saints and martyrs, including John the Baptist and Saba,
               Euthymios and Anthony (?). The soffits of the arches are reserved for female saints,
               among them: Anastasia, Catherine, Barbara, Elizabeth, and Julia (Juliana).</p>
                    <p>These paintings are evidence of a continuing tradition of Christian painting in lands
               dominated by Muslim rulers. In their iconography, they kept alive the painterly
               tradition of the Early Christian Church and also followed closely Byzantine
               innovations from Constantinople. In the 12th cent., some iconographic elements were
               imported from Crusader <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>. In their style, each of the
               layers of paint demonstrate a stylistic tradition in East Christian art that was
               aware of and sensitive to regional developments in Lebanon, Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq and
               Cappadocia. The painters were local Syrians who were also influenced by contemporary
               Islamic art in the region. On the whole, the paintings of Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī remain
               the richest illustration of East Christian art preserved until today.</p>

               Almost all that is known about him comes from a short anonymous biography (in two

               the town of <ref rend="bold">Balad</ref> (modern Eski Mosul) and entered the Monastery
               of Mar Sargis on the ‘Dry Mountain’ (that is, Buṭmān, 15 km. northeast of Balad on
               the west bank of the Tigris). He became a monk at age twenty, then ten years later,
               bp., taking the name Severos. His diocese of Beth Raman was suffragan to the metr. of
               Tagrit. Other sources add to his diocese variously Beth Kiyonaye (that is, Beth
               Bawazig or Beth Waziq, a neighbouring town), <ref rend="bold">Beth ʿArbaye</ref>, and
                  <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>. He died on 12 Feb. 903 at the age of seventy (or acc.
               to other sources, ninety). This date puts his birth in ca. 833 and his consecration
               as bp. in ca. 863.</p>
                    <p>Mushe’s writings cover a wider area of biblical exegesis, traditional theology, and
               liturgy than any previous Syriac writer had attempted to span. Perhaps he was aiming
               at a <hi rend="italic">summa</hi> that would defend the Christian religion within the
               Muslim world. His works are characterized by divisions into short ‘chapters’ or other
               sections, treating specific points in a formulaic way, often by question and answer.
               Mushe is regarded as one of the great scholars of the Syr. Orth. Church. This
               scholarship was, however, largely a matter of compiling excerpts from sources, and
               modern studies of his works have generally been concerned with the analysis of these
               sources. They included E.-Syr. ones, which is not so surprising given that Mushe’s
               career was spent on the E. edge of Syr. Orth. territory.</p>

                    <p>Priest, scribe, and bp. A native of the village of Qāluq, in the region of Ṣawro,
               near <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>, Mushe was sent by Patr. <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdullāh I
                  bar Sṭephanos</ref> to Rome, where he arrived with a few mss. in or shortly before
               1549. The aim of the mission was to search for Syriac printed books or for
               opportunities to produce them. Whether Mushe was additionally entrusted with the
               delicate task of improving relations between the Syr. Orth and the Roman Catholic
               Church remains disputed. Mushe lived in Rome and traveled through Europe until some
               time after 1556.</p>
                    <p>In Rome, he established contacts with some of the earliest Western scholars
               interested in Syriac. Among them were Guillaume Postel, Johann Albrecht
               Widmanstetter, and <ref rend="bold">Andreas Masius</ref>. He collaborated with
               Widmanstetter in the publication of the first edition of the Syriac NT, which
               appeared in Vienna in 1555 and whose Syriac typeface derived from Mushe’s
               handwriting. Mushe served as Masius’s Syriac teacher in Rome, and the latter
               frequently consulted him, in particular while he was preparing his <hi rend="italic">Syrorum Peculium</hi>, a Syriac glossary that was included in vol. 6 of the
               Antwerp Polyglot (1571). Mushe and Masius corresponded in Syriac; a number of
               letters, belonging to the period 1553–55, are preserved. Masius also translated into
               Latin a profession of faith that Mushe is said to have made in 1552 and which Masius
               included in one of his later publications; its exact status remains unclear.</p>
                    <p>During his time in Europe, Mushe copied many Syriac mss. Several of these are extant,
               including the remarkable ms. London, Brit. Libr. Harley 5512, which contains parts of
               the Roman Missal in Latin, written in Serṭo script, along with three Syriac
               Anaphoras. Mushe wrote it for the bp. of the Abyssinian Convent (San Stefano) in
               Rome, where he often resided, and it shows his interest in, and familiarity with, the
               Catholic liturgy.</p>
                    <p>After 1556 Mushe returned to the Middle East, where he copied some further mss.
               (among them <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>’s Chronicle, probably from the author’s
               autograph) and where the (solely honorific?) title of metropolitan bp. was conferred
               on him. He returned to Rome, probably in the company of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Niʿmatullāh</ref>, following the latter’s abdication, in 1578. In Rome he copied
               and annotated several more Syriac and Arabic mss. He died in or shortly after 1592,
               possibly in Rome.</p>

                    <p>Scribe, abbot of <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>, collector of mss. Mushe’s
               presence in Dayr al-Suryān, the ‘Monastery of the Syrians’ in the Egyptian Wadi
               al-Natrun, is attested from the beginning of the 10th cent., when he worked as a
               scribe (903/4) and was instrumental in the donation to the monastery of a 6th-cent.
               biblical ms. (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,142) by a Tagriti family (906/7).
               A  few years later, he was abbot (<hi rend="italic">riš dayro</hi>) and was in charge
               of a major renovation project in the main church. This is recorded in two
               inscriptions dated 914 and 926/7. Mushe’s name may perhaps also be found in a
               majestic Coptic inscription inside the dome of the church, which reads: <hi rend="italic">Papa Moyses pi-hikoymenos</hi> ‘Papa Moses the hegoumenos’. The
               latest mention of Mushe as abbot is found in a note dated 943/4 (ms. London, Brit.
               Libr. Add. 14,525, f. 1v).</p>
                    <p>Shortly after 926/7, Mushe traveled to <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> in order to
               appeal, on behalf of the Egyptian monasteries, against new taxes imposed by Caliph
               al-Muqtadir. The information provided by notes in Syriac mss. is corroborated by the
               Muslim historian al-Maqrīzī, though he does not mention Mushe by name. In the course
               of the long negotiation process in Baghdad, which turned out to be successful, Mushe
               traveled around collecting mss. for the library of Dayr al-Suryān. In 931/2, he
               returned with 250 mss. These mss., bought or received as gifts in <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref>, and
               many other locations in Mesopotamia, at once made Dayr al-Suryān into a major
               treasure house of Syriac Christian culture. Even though Syriac mss. arrived at Dayr
               al-Suryān both before and after Mushe, his was by far the largest single addition to
               the library. In each of the 250 mss. Mushe himself wrote a lengthy note recording the
               acquisition (in this process he more than once erased older notes, thereby destroying
               evidence of the ms.’s previous history). The fact that more than seventy of these
               notes have survived to the present day lends credibility to the reported number of
               250. In the course of the 18th and 19th cent., most of the Syriac mss. from Dayr
               al-Suryān were transferred to major western libraries. A small collection, however,
               still exists in the monastery today. As the most well-known representative of the
               Syrian abbots and of the Syrian and Coptic monks who collected, produced, and
               preserved Syriac mss. in Dayr al-Suryān, Mushe played a unique role in providing
               present-day Syriac scholars with an impressive number of sources of very great
               antiquity.</p>

                    <p>City in S. Arabia (Syr. <hi rend="italic">Nagran</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Negran</hi>; Arab. <hi rend="italic">Najrān</hi>), and city in Iraq. In Christian
               and Muslim sources different legends circulate regarding the introduction of
               Christianity to the S. Arabian city. According to the ‘Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">                  Siirt</ref>’, Ḥannan, a merchant from Nagran, received baptism in the early 5th
               cent. in <ref rend="bold">Ḥirta</ref> and subsequently brought his new religion, of the
               E.-Syr. type, to Nagran. In the 5th cent. we also hear of the presence of Jews in
               Nagran.</p>
                    <p>Nagran became widely known in the Christian world as the central stage for the
               persecution of Christians by the king of <ref rend="bold">Ḥimyar</ref> in either 518 or
               523 (the date is disputed). Accounts of the martyrdom of Christians in Nagran, which
               also include several female martyrs, are preserved in two Syriac letters and in the
               ‘Book of the Ḥimyarites’. A few years later, Ḥimyarite supremacy on the Arabian
               Peninsula ended and S. Arabia became an Ethiopian protectorate. In 572 it was
               conquered by the Persians; in 628 it came under Muslim rule.</p>
                    <p>The Syriac sources present the persecuted Christians of Nagran as anti-Chalcedonian,
               Miaphysite. There is some evidence that Miaphysitism in Nagran was of the
               Aphthartodocetic type, i.e. in agreement with the doctrine of <ref rend="bold">Julian
                  of Halicarnassus</ref>. As the controversy between <ref rend="bold">Severus of
                  Antioch</ref> and Julian only broke out in the 520s, this would not yet have been
               the case in the time of the persecution.</p>
                    <p>Christianity in Nagran was known in early Muslim sources. Surah 85:4–9 of the Qurʾān
               is often understood as referring to the persecuted Christians of Nagran, i.e. ‘the
               men of the furnace’ (<hi rend="italic">al-’ukhdūd</hi>). In 630, Christians from
               Nagran are said to have traveled to Medina, to meet the Prophet Muḥammad, with whom
               they concluded a pact, allowing them to practice their religion. The existence of
               this pact, known in both Muslim and Christian sources, gave rise to the creation of
               apocryphal documents, such as those preserved in the ‘Chronicle of Siirt’ (PO 13,
               601–18). A few years later, however, during the caliphate of ʿUmar (634–44), the
               Christians from Nagran were forced to leave the Peninsula, even though a small number
               may have remained for some time. They settled near Ḥirta, in Iraq, in a city that
               they called Nagran after their first home. In the late 8th cent., Patr. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos</ref> was able to integrate the descendants of the exiles into
               the Ch. of E. In one of his letters, datable perhaps to 791/92, he reports that they
               had given up their adherence to Julianism and asked him to consecrate a bp. For the
               9th and 10th cent., however, the names of four Syr. Orth. bishops are preserved in
               the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, indicating that either the
               Nagranites had changed allegiance once again, or that two hierarchies co-existed in
               the Iraqi city.</p>

                    <p>Poet and teacher of exegesis at the <ref rend="bold">School of Edessa</ref> and at the
                  <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref>; author of popular verse homilies (<hi rend="italic">memre</hi>). The main sources for our knowledge of Narsai’s life are
               the two works attributed to <ref rend="bold">Barḥadbshabba</ref> (the Ecclesiastical
               History and the ‘Cause of the foundation of the schools’) which, however, differ from
               each other at several points and are not always reliable.</p>
                    <p>Born in ʿAyn Dulba, near Maʿalta in northern Mesopotamia (within Persian territory),
               Narsai was orphaned at the age of sixteen and educated by his uncle, the abbot of the
               Monastery of Kfar Mari, west of the Tigris. At an unknown date he went to study in
               the School of Edessa, where he spent many years, first as a student and later as a
               teacher and director (‘Rabban’). His directorship, which probably did not begin
               before ca. 450, is said to have lasted twenty years, and came to an end with his
               expulsion. The date of this expulsion is uncertain; it may have taken place at any
               time between the death of the Dyophysite bp. <ref rend="bold">Hiba</ref> of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, in 457, and the official closure of the School in 489.
               Vööbus (46) suggests a date some time after 471. Following his expulsion, Narsai was
               well received in <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> by bp. <ref rend="bold">Barṣawma</ref>,
               who persuaded him to found a new school in this city. Even though there was a fall
               out between Narsai and Barṣawma, which the sources blame on the bp.’s wife, Mamai,
               and which resulted in Narsai’s temporary absence from Nisibis, he remained the head
               of the new School until his death (ca. 500). The statutes of the School, dated 496,
               contain Narsai’s name.</p>
                    <p>During his years in Edessa, Narsai was exposed to the theology and the biblical
               interpretation of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> (d. 428), whose works
               were translated into Syriac in and around the School of Edessa in the first half of
               the 5th cent. and had a lasting impact on Narsai. In the Ecclesiastical History
               attributed to Barḥadbshabba, <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (portrayed here in
               negative terms) is explicitly mentioned as the one who preceded Narsai in composing
                  <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> and triggered Narsai’s response with compositions in
               this same genre (ed. F. Nau [PO 9.5], 612; ET in Becker 2008, 69). Narsai and Yaʿqub
               (who also spent some time in Edessa, probably in the 460s) are representative of the
               two different approaches to Theodore’s legacy: while for Narsai and the later E.-Syr.
               (Dyophysite) tradition Theodore became the most authoritative theologian and exegete,
               Yaʿqub and the later (Miaphysite) W.-Syr. tradition rejected him and instead remained
               closer to <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>’s writings (which inspired the E. Syrians as
               well) and found their main theological authority in <ref rend="bold">Cyril of
                  Alexandria</ref> (who sometimes is the explicit target of attack in Narsai’s <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>). Even though it is unknown whether Narsai and Yaʿqub
               ever met in person in Edessa, they share a number of themes, motifs, and approaches,
               which must reflect their common Edessene background.</p>
                    <p>Narsai’s <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> focus on salvation history as an ongoing
               learning process for humanity, in which Christ’s incarnation, with his two natures
               (God and man) preserved intact, is the key moment. Many <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>
               deal with biblical interpretation, either OT or NT; others are devoted to specific
               liturgical feasts or address topics of theological or moral significance. One <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> (no. 11 in Mingana’s list; ed. F. Martin) is a defense of
               the three Antiochene teachers, <ref rend="bold">Diodore of Tarsus</ref>, Theodore of
               Mopsuestia, and <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref>. Narsai’s <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>
               represent an important phase in the formation of E.-Syr. theological and exegetical
               tradition, which depended heavily on the thought of Theodore, but also was shaped by
               the E.-Syrians’ ‘agency and creativity in this process of reception’ (Becker, 125).
               The <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> were widely read and used in the later tradition,
               e.g., by Cath. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>, who mentions and quotes them in his
               letters, by <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, who often relies on them in his
               own commentaries, and by <ref rend="bold">Emmanuel bar Shahhare</ref>, for whom Narsai
               served as a model (and in whose collection of <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> one of
               Narsai’s <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> [no. 81] became entangled).</p>
                    <p>At present, 81 <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> by Narsai are known to exist in mss.,
               gathered together in collections intended for liturgical use. The majority are in the
               dodecasyllabic meter, while the rest are heptasyllabic. A. Mingana, who provided the
               first list of all existing <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, edited 47 of them in his
               1905 publication. Several <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> were edited separately, in
               particular by Ph. Gignoux (1968), F. G.  McLeod (1979), E. P.  Siman (1984), and
               J.  Frishman (1992). A 1970 facsimile edition of a recent ms. includes 72  <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> (several of them not published elsewhere). While W. F.
               Macomber in 1973 provided an inventory of all then known mss. containing Narsai’s <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, S. P. Brock’s 2009 ‘Guide to Narsai’s homilies’ gives a
               convenient synopsis of all existing editions and translations, taking the Mingana
               list of 81 <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> (which was also adopted by Macomber) as its
               starting point.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, a number of <hi rend="italic">sugyoto</hi> carry Narsai’s name (ten are included in Mingana’s edition, vol.  2,
               366–411), but most of these are very likely not his. In addition, a collection of
               four <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> on Joseph (Gen. 37–48) has been attributed to
               Narsai and published under his name. This attribution cannot be substantiated (see
               the most recent and thorough analysis in K. S. Heal, <hi rend="italic">Tradition and
                  transformation: Genesis 37 and 39 in early Syriac sources</hi> [Ph. D.
               dissertation, Birmingham; 2008], 33–68, with further references).</p>

                    <p>Bp. of Sirzor; biblical interpreter. Nathniel studied at the <ref rend="bold">School of
                  Nisibis</ref> and he probably continued working in the field of biblical
               interpretation after his graduation, but no details are known. As bp. of Sirzor he
               attended the synods of 585 (under <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb I</ref>) and 605 (under
                  <ref rend="bold">Grigor I</ref>) and signed the acts. At some later point during his
               tenure he was imprisoned (for having expelled from his city a Persian commander who
               had destroyed churches) and then put to death, still under the reign of Khusrau (r.
               590–628), as is mentioned in the title of his surviving work.</p>
                    <p>The only text by Nathniel that has been preserved is a ‘Cause of the Psalms’ (<hi rend="italic">ʿEllat mazmore</hi>), which is a brief introduction to the Psalms.
               This is included in a larger collection of E.-Syr. introductory pieces to the Psalms,
               called ‘Book of causes of the Psalms’, which is found in a number of 19th-cent. mss.
               as a preamble to the Commentary on the Psalms by <ref rend="bold">Denḥa</ref> (9th
               cent.?). The collection as a whole and the various mss. that contain it have been
               surveyed by Van den Eynde and Van Rompay. Nathniel’s text has been edited by
               Vandenhoff (with LT).</p>

                    <p>Syriac scholar, co-founder of the Patrologia Orientalis. Born in Lorraine, he studied
               theology at the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Paris and was ordained a priest in 1887.
               He then continued his studies in natural sciences at the Institut catholique in Paris
               from 1887 to 1894. He obtained a <hi rend="italic">licence</hi> in mathematics,
               another one in physics, and received the doctor’s degree in mathematics in 1897.
               Throughout his life he taught mathematics at the Institut catholique, as well as in
               different schools in Paris. It was for a distraction that he began to study Syriac
               under <ref rend="bold">René Graffin</ref>. On this occasion, he discovered the richness
               of scientific literature in Syriac. He earned the diploma of the École Pratique des
               Hautes Études in 1895 with the edition and French translation of the Syriac text of
                  <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s treatise on the ‘Ascent of the mind’ (<hi rend="italic">Suloqo hawnonoyo</hi>), which was published in 1899. This was the
               beginning of a steady stream of publications in all fields of Syriac and Near Eastern
               studies, not only on sciences and cosmography but also on Apocrypha, canonical
               literature, hagiography, history, etc. His Syriac bibliography includes 240 books and
               articles, without counting the many entries that he wrote for the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire de la Bible</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire de théologie
                  catholique</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire d’histoire et de géographie
                  ecclésiastiques</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire apologétique de la foi
                  catholique</hi>, and the many reviews published in the <hi rend="italic">Revue de
                  l’Orient Chrétien</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Journal asiatique</hi>, and other
               periodicals. A large number of Nau’s publications contain the edition or study and
               translation of previously unknown texts, many of which he himself discovered in mss.,
               mostly in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, but also in the British Museum, or in
               private collections. Of special interest are his supplement (1911) and his additions
               and corrections (1915) to the catalogue of Syriac mss. in Paris as well as his
               monographs on several of these mss. He published Syriac text editions and French
               translations of many narrative texts, including, among other texts, the ‘Book of the
               Laws of Countries’ associated with the school of <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>,
               lives of saints, ascetics, and ecclesiastical dignitaries (e.g. <ref rend="bold">Marutha</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Aḥudemmeh</ref>), letters of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, chronicles, texts of the Maron. and E.-Syr. traditions,
               and different versions of the history of <ref rend="bold">Aḥiqar</ref> in Syriac.
               Several studies deal with natural sciences, i.e. cosmography and astronomy (including
               the publication of the ‘Treatise on the astrolabe’ and the ‘Treatise on
               Constellations’ by <ref rend="bold">Severos Sebokht</ref>), with maps, with canonical
               literature (<ref rend="bold">Didascalia Apostolorum</ref>, canonical resolutions), with
               calendars, synaxaries, menologies, and martyrologies. He also studied the documents
               of Central Asia, in particular the tomb stones of Kyrgyzstan. His editorial
               leadership is also essential. Together with <ref rend="bold">René Graffin</ref>, he
               founded the Patrologia Orientalis. He also was the secretary and later the director
               of the <hi rend="italic">Revue de l’Orient Chrétien</hi>. He contributed to both with
               numerous important publications.</p>

                <p>The term Nestorianism refers to the idea, allegedly taught by <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref>, that in the incarnate Christ the Son of God and the son of Mary
               represent two separate subjects. In western scholarship the term has often
               misleadingly and incorrectly been used to describe the teaching of the Ch. of E. In
               the christological controversies that followed the Council of Chalcedon (451)
               ‘Nestorian’ was used as a polemical term to brand as heretical any who held a strict
               dyophysite position (miaphysites indeed used it of <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
               dyophysites). After the Arab conquests the label came to be employed solely for the
               Ch of E., and this usage has unfortunately been taken over in much western writing.

                    <p>From 790 until his death, Nestorios occupied the episcopal see of <ref rend="bold">Beth
                  Nuhadra</ref>. Before being admitted to this office, he had to be cleared from any
               mistrust concerning his orthodoxy. His formal abjuration of messalianism and other
               heterodox teachings (preserved among Patr. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos</ref>’s letters
               and published by Braun) opened the way to his consecration and (as far as we know)
               uneventful tenure as bp., enjoying the support of his Patr.</p>
                    <p>This investigation should be seen in the context of the synod of 790/91, at which
               three mystics were condemned: <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref>, and (a certain) Yoḥannan Iḥidaya (the condemnation
               was later lifted under Timotheos’s successor). Since Nestorios had lived in the
               Monastery of Mar Yozadaq (in Beth Qardu), the home of Yoḥannan of Dalyatha, and also
               had known Yawsep Ḥazzaya, it is not surprising that he was associated with them.</p>
                    <p>In his ‘Book of Chastity’ <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref> of Baṣra attributes to
               Nestorios a no longer extant biography of Yawsep Ḥazzaya. Nestorios may have written
               it in defense of Yawsep when the latter became victim to accusations. One short
               treatise by Nestorios is preserved, ‘On the initial motion (<hi rend="italic">mettziʿānutā</hi>) of God’s grace’. In it Nestorios argues that due to the
               ‘natural seeds’ that God instilled in us (weakened by sin but reinvigorated by
               Christ’s coming), we are able to receive God’s fire. He also maintains that man
               indeed is able to see God in a spiritual vision, a hotly debated question in
               Nestorios’s day. Nestorios certainly was ‘not a marginal’ figure in a period when the
               Ch. of E. was trying to strike a balance ‘between institution and prophecy’
               (Berti).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Bp. of Constantinople from 428 to 431. Syriac sources put his birthplace in
               Germanicea (modern Kahramanmaraş) in the province of Euphratesia, although these
               sources may misunderstand the statement of the church historian Socrates, a
               contemporary of Nestorius, that his family came from that town (Ecclesiastical
               History, 7.29). There is no evidence that Nestorius could speak or write Syriac,
               despite his family background. In <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> he distinguished
               himself as an orator and perhaps planned a legal career before being drawn to the
               vibrant monastic life of the city. Although it is not clear that Nestorius studied
               under <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> directly, his subsequent insistence
               on the two natures firmly placed him within Theodore’s intellectual milieu.</p>
                    <p>When Sisinnius of Constantinople died on 24 Dec. 427, several candidates vied for his
               position, including Philip, future bp. of Side, and <ref rend="bold">Proclus</ref> of
               Cyzicus. According to Nestorius himself, the emperor Theodosius personally intervened
               to have him brought to the capital as an outsider to cut through the acrimonious
               dispute between the factions. Ordained bp. on 10 April 428, Nestorius vigorously
               pursued pagans and heretics and likely induced the emperor to issue a new edict
               against a whole host of aberrant beliefs (Codex Theodosianus 16.5.66; 20 May 428). He
               likely also celebrated the first liturgical commemoration for his fellow Antiochene
               and past bp. of Constantinople, <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref>, on 26 Sept.
               428.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps as early as the summer 428 members of Nestorius’s cadre in the capital, the
               presbyter Anastasius and Dorotheus of Marcianopolis, made denunciations of the
               appellation Theotokos (lit. ‘God-bearer’) for the Virgin Mary. By the winter of 428/9
               sermons to this effect, some of which were almost surely by Nestorius, began
               circulating among the monasteries of Egypt. These soon elicited a critical reaction
               from <ref rend="bold">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, who addressed three letters to
               Nestorius, as well as others to Celestine of Rome in order to gain the pope’s
               support. Nestorius, however, refused to distance himself from the beliefs of his
               subordinates and continued to quibble with the legitimacy of Theotokos, and proposed
               instead a neologism, Christotokos (‘Christ-bearer’) as a compromise. In order to put
               to rest the growing controversy, the emperor summoned a council to meet at Ephesus in
               431 to discuss the faith.</p>
                    <p>Nestorius refrained from attending not only Cyril’s council, which deposed him, but
               also, it seems, the counter-council convened by John of Antioch to fight his case.
               Instead he asked the emperor repeatedly to permit his retirement from the episcopate
               and his return to his monastery in Antioch, a request to which the emperor finally
               acquiesced in the late summer of 431. Nestorius lived just outside of Antioch until
               an imperial order of 435 exiled him to Petra. He was transferred later to the Oasis
               in Egypt, where, according to excerpts of his letters preserved in Evagrius
               Scholasticus (Ecclesiastical History, 1.7) he was captured by raiding tribes, and
               moved from Panopolis in the Thebaid to Elephantine, 320 km. to the south, and then
               back to Panopolis where he remained until his death late in the year 450.</p>

               These excerpts include a passage of his ‘On plants’. Whether this work, which in its
               Latin version and Greek retroversion made from the Latin was later ascribed to
               Aristotle, originally constituted a separate work or was a part of the compendium is
               difficult to determine. Passages in the section of the compendium dealing with
               meteorology are accompanied by a large number of scholia which are often based on the
               commentary on Aristotle’s ‘Meteorologica’ by Olympiodorus (6th cent.). Two of these

               remains uncertain at the present state of research whether the scholia alone or both
               the scholia and the translation should be attributed to Ḥunayn. The Syriac version of
               the compendium was used extensively as a source by Bar ʿEbroyo in his ‘Candelabrum of

                    <p>Greek monastic author. A number of writings in Greek are associated with Nilus, abbot
               of a monastery near Ankyra (Ankara); among these are several which are in fact by
                  <ref rend="bold">Evagrius of Pontus</ref> (preserved in Syriac, however, with their
               correct attribution). The works which are translated into Syriac under the name of
               ‘Nilus the Solitary’ consist of the following: a collection of some 160 short sayings
               entitled (in some mss.) ‘Pearls’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 6068); these are related
               to a Greek collection attributed either to Nilus or to Hesychius (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 6583); a Discourse on the monastic way of life (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 6060), which seems to be a different, and older, recension of the Greek
               text on this subject under the name of Nilus (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 6046); and
               four ‘Admonitions’, or ‘Letters’, on different ascetic topics; the first and third of
               these are addressed to Philotheos (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 6061) and Theosebios
                  (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 6064) respectively. None of these four texts can be
               identified as known Greek texts, though they seem to have been translated from
               Greek.</p>

                    <p>Scholar, astronomer, maph. (1555–7) and Patr. (1557–1576). Born in <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> to Maqdasī Yuḥanon Nūr al-Dīn, he joined <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  al-Zaʿfarān</ref> ca. 1535. Niʿmatullāh mastered the sciences and the arts,
               especially astronomy, medicine, philosophy, and painting. Upon becoming a Patr., he
               adopted the honorific name Ignatius. During his patriarchate, he visited Syria in
               1562 and united the patriarchate of <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> with his own in
               1572, a union that lasted until 1584. He abdicated, or was forced to abdicate, in
               March 1576 under peculiar circumstances. <ref rend="bold">Dolabani</ref> (<hi rend="italic">Patriarchen</hi>, 206) narrates that the governor of <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>, a close friend of Niʿmatullāh, announced to the local Muslim notables
               who wished to execute the Patr. that Niʿmatullāh had adopted Islam. Niʿmatullāh gave
               no denial fearing execution and had to abdicate. Shortly after his abdication, he
               escaped in disguise and fled to the west. He arrived in Rome, coming from Venice,
               sometime between the end of 1576 and early 1578 carrying a recommendation from the
               Patr. of Aquileia. He was received in audience by Pope Gregory on 30  Jan. 1578.</p>
                    <p>Impressing others by his knowledge in medicine and mathematics, Niʿmatullāh was
               invited to join the papal commission on calendar reform. He wrote an extensive
               criticism of the Compendium, the reform proposal which was sent by Pope Gregory to
               all Catholic princes, in which he pointed out: 1. the anticipation of the equinox
               cannot be one day in 134 years; 2. the sun anticipates one day in 132 years according
               to observations in the East; 3. leaving out 10 leap days every 40 years should be
               rejected; 4. turn-of-the-century adjustments are irregular; 5. the moon gains one day
               every 276  years, not 304; 6. the Compendium’s method of computing the 14th day of
               the lunation results in celebrating Easter before Passover; and 7. Easter may be
               celebrated a month later for the same reason. Niʿmatullāh also added to the list of
               authorities cited in the Compendium, Chapter 23 of the <ref rend="bold">Didascalia
                  Apostolorum</ref> and the acts of the Council of Nicaea. On 14 Sept. 1580,
               Niʿmatullāh signed the final report of the commission with his colleagues; his
               signature, in Syriac and Arabic, was interpreted by the translator Leonardo Abel.
               Niʿmatullāh was probably involved in producing an Arabic edition in <ref rend="bold">Garshuni</ref> of the papal decree on the new calendar with its rules sometime
               around or after 1583. Niʿmatullāh’s criticism of the Compendium in Garshuni is
               preserved at the Laurentiana Library, Florence; a Latin translation was made at the
               time by L. Abel and is preserved in the Vatican Archives, dated 12 March 1580.</p>
                    <p>Niʿmatullāh attempted to persuade the Syr. Orth. and Coptic churches to accept the
               new ‘Gregorian calendar’, but did not succeed. In 1583, his interpreter, Abel, was
               sent as a legate of the Pope to Syria with a letter from Niʿmatullāh to his successor
               Patr. Dawid Shah. Abel did not manage to meet with the Patr., but reported that,
               fearing the Turks, the Patr. refused to accept the calendar unless all other nations
               did so first.</p>
                    <p>Niʿmatullāh made a painting of the Virgin Mary and sent it, it is said, with a small
               piece of the Holy Cross as a gift to the Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> and
               his successors; they are still preserved in the Church of the Virgin in Diyarbakır.
               Niʿmatullāh also wrote a brief description of the European kingdoms, especially
               Italy.</p>

                    <p>A very ancient city in northern Iraq located on the eastern side of the Tigris River,
               directly across from the medieval and modern city of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>. The
               site owed its earliest development, from ca. 6000 BC, to its position beside a
               crossable portion of the Tigris (Oates 1968, 52). Nineveh reached its apex in the 7th
               cent. BC, when it served as the capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire under Kings
               Sennacherib (r. 705–681 BC), Esarhaddon (r. 681–69 BC), and Ashurbanipal (r. 668–27
               BC). The rediscovery of its royal palaces played a central role in the development of
               modern Assyriology. In 1847, a thirty-year old Englishman named Austen Henry Layard
               began excavations at the site and almost immediately uncovered the remains of
               Sennacherib’s palace beneath the modern tell called Kuyunjik. Six years later, in
               1853, Layard’s former assistant, Hormuzd Rassam, a Chaldean Christian from Mosul,
               excavated the palace of Ashurbanipal. Recent scholarship has finally given Rassam due
               credit for this discovery, an accomplishment obscured at the time by British Museum
               officials, who attacked Rassam as an&#160;‘Oriental’ unqualified to run the excavation
               (Larsen 1994, esp. 317–32). British archaeologists continued to conduct intermittent
               excavations at Nineveh over the next century, followed by the Iraqis from the second
               half of the 1960s. American excavations (1987–1990) found dramatic evidence for
               Nineveh’s destruction in 612 BC, when a combined force of Medes, Elamites, and
               Babylonians burned and pillaged the city (Stronach and Lumsden 1992).</p>
                    <p>In both ancient and modern culture, Nineveh’s destruction has often served as an
               evocative paradigm for the sudden collapse of a mighty empire. But as stories about
               the destruction of Assyrian Nineveh percolated in Classical and Near Eastern
               folklore, the city itself experienced a long, slow recovery, eventually re-emerging
               as a significant urban center and then bishopric. Under the Seleucids, the city was
               re-founded as a <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> and received ‘at least the superficial
               forms of Hellenistic city organization’ (Oates 1968, 61). Greek inscriptions and
               sculptural fragments attest to the strength of the city’s Hellenistic culture as late
               as the 2nd cent. AD (Reade 1998). Not surprisingly, Hellenistic and indigenous
               traditions often intertwined or merged (Reade 2001, 198).</p>
                    <p>By the early 3rd cent. AD, Christianity had established a significant presence in the
               surrounding territory of <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref>, which operated as a
               semi-autonomous kingdom, with its capital at <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref> (modern
               Erbil), until the Sasanian conquests of the 220s. When and how Christianity arrived
               in Nineveh remains unclear. Local tradition among the modern Christians of Mosul
               holds that a monastery dedicated to the Prophet Jonah was built on the tell of Nabī
               Yūnus during the 4th cent. (Fiey 1965, vol. 2, 497–8). But there is no indisputable
               textual or archaeological evidence for Christianity at the site until the mid-6th
               cent., when <ref rend="bold">Aḥudemmeh</ref>, bp. of Nineveh, participated in the
               E.-Syr. synod of 554. Later bishops of the city included the future Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> (d.  659) and, briefly, the renowned 7th-cent.
               mystic <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref> (Fiey 1993, 115–16). At some stage
               before the mid-9th cent., the bishopric was merged with that of Mosul, which appears
               to have grown rapidly following its foundation as an Arab camp (<hi rend="italic">miṣr</hi>) in the 640s.</p>
                    <p>Nineveh also served as the base for a Syr. Orth. bishopric, closely associated with
               the nearby <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> (Fiey 1965, 349–53; idem 1993,
               239–40). One of the first holders of the bishopric, Mar Zakkay (593–605),
               distinguished himself as an intrepid polemicist against the ‘Nestorians’ (Fiey 1965,
               vol. 2, 783; idem 2004, 197–98). After the victory of the Emperor Heraclius at the
               Battle of Nineveh in 626, the Syr. Orth. expanded their presence throughout the
               entire region. A Syr. Orth. school established at Nineveh in the early 7th cent. had
               more than 300 students at its height in the mid–9th cent. (Fiey 1965, vol. 2,
               499).</p>
                    <p>Local Christians recognized Nineveh as the former capital of the Neo-Assyrian Empire,
               but their understanding of this past was fragmentary, distorted, and sometimes
               fantastic. Stories about imperial Nineveh included the aphorisms of the Assyrian sage
                  <ref rend="bold">Aḥiqar</ref> and the Biblical books of Tobit and Jonah. Syr.
               Christians had long been fascinated by the story of the Ninevites’ repentance (Jonah
               3:1–10), an episode that inspired a popular <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> by the poet
                  <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> (d. 373). Sometime between the late 560s and the
               mid-7th cent., the Rogation of the Ninevites was adopted as a formal festival of the
               Ch. of E. to celebrate the passing of the plague (Fiey 1965, 498, esp. n. 5, on the
               problem of the dating). The Rogation, also known as the Fast of the Ninevites,
               continues to be celebrated with great intensity and three-day fasts in some E.-Syr.
               communities today.</p>
                    <p>The archaeology of Christianity at Nineveh has only recently begun to receive close
               attention (Simpson 2005). Christian objects found during the British excavations
               include fragments of a painted stucco cross and a small brass lamp with a
               cross-shaped lid. Unfortunately, the famous monastery of Jonah, which stood atop the
               modern tell of Nabī Yūnus, is known only from textual sources. In 701, the ill-fated
               E.-Syr. Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ḥenanishoʿ</ref> was buried in the monastery, and its
               chapel was restored by the Patr. Sargis (860–72). By this time, the monastery had
               also become a favorite haunt for the revelries of Islamic visitors, who penned
               enthusiastic verses about its wine (Fiey 1965, 2, 500). At some point in the 10th
               cent., if not before, the monastery was transformed into an Islamic shrine (<hi rend="italic">masjad</hi>) dedicated to the prophet Jonah (Nabī Yūnus). This
               mosque remains to this day a much-venerated shrine visited by members of all the
               religious communities of the region.</p>
                    <p>Gradually, beginning in late antiquity, the countryside surrounding Nineveh filled
               with a mixture of villages belonging to either the Ch. of E. or the Syr. Orth.
               Church, often living in close proximity to local Muslims, Jews, and Yazidis. Many of
               these villages developed strong local traditions of Christian architecture and
               scribal activity (Fiey 1965, vol. 2, 354–491). Even in the modern Diaspora, the
               distinct identity of many of these Christian villages, such as <ref rend="bold">Telkepe</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Qaraqosh</ref>, has not been forgotten.</p>

                    <p>City in Mesopotamia and important center of early Syriac Christianity. Birthplace,
               among others, of <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> and site of the <ref rend="bold">School of
                  Nisibis</ref>. The Syriac name <hi rend="italic">Nṣibin</hi> can be traced back to
               Assyrian <hi rend="italic">Naṣibīna</hi>, while the name <hi rend="italic">Ṣobā</hi>,
               based on identification with biblical Ṣōbā (2 Sam. 8.1), seems to be of relatively
               late origin. Nisibis is located on a main east-west route in an area watered by the
               Çağçağ river (ancient Mygdonius), a tributary of the Khabur, which emerges from Mount
               Izla, or the southern slopes of <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, on to the
               Mesopotamian plain just north of Nisibis. A border town in Turkey today opposite
               Syrian Qamishli, Nisibis was a frontier town in ancient times in an area contested
               between the Roman and Persian empires. Along with the monasteries on Mount Izla, it
               was also in an area where the spheres of influence of the E.-Syr. and W.-Syr.
               churches met. E. Syriacs, predominant at first, were later outnumbered by W. Syriacs
               among the dwindling population of Christians in the town.</p>
                    <p>Legends attribute the evangelisation of Nisibis to <ref rend="bold">Addai</ref> or to
               his disciples Aggai and Mari. The first attested bp. of the city is <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> (308/9 – after 338) who attended the Council of Nicaea
               and is commemorated, along with his successors Babu and Vologeses (d. 361/2), by his
               pupil Ephrem in his <hi rend="italic">Carmina nisibena</hi>. After its cession by
               Jovian to Shapur II in 363, Nisibis remained more or less permanently in Sasanian
               hands until the Islamic conquest in 640.</p>
                    <p>At the Ch. of E. synod of 410 Nisibis was made the metropolitan see of <ref rend="bold">Beth ʿArbaye</ref> with Arzun, Qardu, Beth Zabdai, Beth Rahimai, and Beth Moksaye
               as suffragans. The episcopate of <ref rend="bold">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref> (ca.
               450–91) saw the establishment of the School of Nisibis under the leadership of <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>. Under Islamic rule, with the disappearance of the
               Roman-Persian border, Nisibis gradually lost its strategic, as well as commercial,
               importance. Later occupants of the see include <ref rend="bold">Eliya of Nisibis</ref>,
                  <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb bar Malkon</ref> (before 1222–47?), and <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>. When, between 1482 and 1489, Syr. Orth. Patr.
               Ignatius Sobo of Ṭur ʿAbdin attempted to gain control of the churches of St. Jacob
               and St. Domitius, the E. Syriacs were still numerous enough to resist this move. The
               E. Syr. see of Nisibis, Chald. by then, was finally suppressed in 1616.</p>
                    <p>The first appearance of a Syr. Orth. bishop of Nisibis (Abraham, 631) may be
               connected with the Roman advances made in the area under Emperor Heraclius. Bishops
               specifically for Nisibis are known from the end of the 8th cent. until the 11th
               cent., but in the 12th cent. ‘Nisibis’ is found among the titles of the metropolitans
               of <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>. From then on, no resident Syr. Orth. bp. of Nisibis
               is attested until 1860.</p>
                    <p>O. H. Parry found 300 Muslim, 150 Jewish, and 30 Syrian families in the town on a
               visit in 1892. The Christian community in the town, reported to number 200 families
               in 1915, disappeared after the First World War, although the presence of three
               Christian families after the Second World War is mentioned by Anschütz.</p>
                    <p>Little remains of the Christian past in Nisibis, but the Church of St. Jacob,
               incorporating the baptistery built in 359 and the crypt with the tomb of Yaʿqub of
               Nisibis, is still maintained as a church (Syr. Orth. since 1865). Excavations have
               been under way since 2000 in the area to the south of the church, the site of the
               original cathedral built by Yaʿqub of Nisibis in 312–20. The church of St. Febronia
               (4th cent. martyr) is now the Mosque of Zayn al-ʿĀbidīn.</p>

                    <p>The School of Nisibis was an E.-Syr. institution of learning founded in part by
               refugees from the <ref rend="bold">School of Edessa</ref> after the latter was forcibly
               closed by the religious and political authorities in 489, because it had become an
               exegetical circle of dyophysite Christians whose Antiochene theology was no longer
               welcome in a Roman Empire split by Christological controversy. The School of Nisibis
               flourished through the early 7th cent., after which time our sources become sparse.
               Aside from the actual school documents, numerous texts from the period and later
               refer to members of the Ch. of E., including those who would go on to become
               important authors, martyrs, bishops, and catholicoi, as studying at the School.</p>
                    <p>The most important sources for the School of Nisibis are: 1. the two sets of canons,
               similar to those of a monastery, instituted in 496 and 602, and material deriving
               from their later ratifications; 2. the last two chapters of the Ecclesiastical
               History of <ref rend="bold">Barḥadbshabba</ref>, which consist of separate lives of
                  <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>, the first head of the School and its founder along
               with <ref rend="bold">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref>, and of <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Beth
                  Rabban</ref>, its head for several decades in the 6th cent.; and 3. The so-called
               ‘Cause of the Foundation of the Schools’, attributed possibly to the same
               Barḥadbshabba.</p>
                    <p>Study at the school was centered primarily around scripture and its interpretation.
               The sources refer to different types of teacher: the elementary instructor (<hi rend="italic">mhaggyānā</hi>); the reader (<hi rend="italic">maqryānā</hi>); and
               finally the exegete (<hi rend="italic">mpaššqānā</hi>), who was the sole occupant of
               this office and the head of the School. Judging from the different offices of
               instruction and anecdotes from various texts, students acquired a broad range of
               learning at the school, from basic literacy to knowledge of the E.-Syr. exegetical
               tradition, the basics of Aristotelian logic, and the forms of composition and debate.
               The exegesis of the School was heavily based on the E.-Syr. reception of <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> (d. 428), who was treated by many as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> exegetical and theological authority. One genre associated
               with the School and other E.-Syr. schools seems to have been the ‘cause’ (<hi rend="italic">ʿelltā</hi>), which was focused primarily on the aetiological
               discussion of E.-Syr. festival days.</p>
                    <p>We know little about the actual physical space of the School, for example, where it
               lay in modern Nusaybin. However, by the mid-6th cent. it was endowed with a local
               village all the proceeds of which went to it, and baths were built both for the
               brothers and as a means of revenue. The rules suggest that the School was within the
               town, but that a social separation between members and local citizens was maintained.
               Aside from the teaching staff, the School also had a <hi rend="italic">rabbaytā</hi>,
               or steward, who was responsible for both discipline and the day-to-day running of the
               institution.</p>
                    <p>The School may have served as a model to other E.-Syr. schools, varieties of which
               spread in the Sasanian Empire through the 6th cent. This, along with theological
               controversy surrounding <ref rend="bold">Ḥenana</ref> of <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref>,
               its head at the turn of the 7th cent., may explain its eventual decline.</p>

               in 1856, he undertook trips to Leipzig, Vienna, Leiden, Gotha, and Berlin, mainly to
               study Arabic and Turkish mss. Between 1858 and 1860, he was an assistant at the
               Königliche Bibliothek (Royal Library) in Berlin, and from 1860 at the University
               Library in Göttingen. In 1861, he became a <hi rend="italic">Privatdozent</hi>
               (university lecturer) for Semitic languages at Göttingen. In 1864 followed his
               appointment as professor of Near Eastern languages at the University of Kiel, and in
               1872 at the newly founded German University of Strasbourg in the Alsace. After his
               retirement, in 1906, he first stayed in Strasbourg, until 1920, and then moved to
               Karlsruhe.</p>
                    <p>In his earliest writings, Nöldeke dealt with the Qurʾān. His main publication in this
               field <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des Qorans</hi> (History of the Qurʾān) first
               appeared in 1860 and provided a new, solid foundation for research on the Qurʾān.
               Other projects concerned Arabic poetry and fable research. In 1896, a study on the
               classical Arabic language appeared.</p>
                    <p>During his time in Kiel, where he also taught Old Testament and Sanskrit, and where
               the University Library had rich Syriac holdings, his interests in Aramaic became more
               prominent. It is in this period that he laid the foundations for his scholarly work
               on Syriac, Neo-Syriac, and Mandaic. As early as 1868, he published his <hi rend="italic">Grammatik der neusyrischen Sprache am Urmia-See und in
                  Kurdistan</hi> (Grammar of the Neo-Syriac language at Lake Urmia and in
               Kurdistan), which was based on the publications of the American missionaries. His <hi rend="italic">Mandäische Grammatik</hi> (Mandaic Grammar) followed in 1875. On the
               basis of his extensive readings in Syriac literature, he wrote his Syriac Grammar,
               the first edition of which appeared in 1880 and the second expanded edition in 1898.
               Without going into too much linguistic detail, its focus is on syntax, amply
               documented with textual references. As such it remains a unique tool up to the
               present day. An English translation appeared in 1904. Even though the content of
               Syriac literature — to which he devoted a short survey essay in 1906 — did not
               strongly appeal to him, he devoted studies to individual works such as the <ref rend="bold">Alexander</ref>Romance, <ref rend="bold">Julian Romance</ref>, the <ref rend="bold">Aḥiqar</ref>Story, and <ref rend="bold">Kalila and Dimna</ref>. In
               addition, his contributions to Syriac studies consisted of numerous essays and
               reviews.</p>
                    <p>A further important field of Nöldeke’s research was Iranian history and literature.
               In 1879, he published a translation from the Arabic Chronicle of al-Ṭabarī, entitled
                  <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Perser und Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden</hi>
               (History of the Persians and Arabs in the time of the Sasanians). His relevant
               contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi> were reworked in
               German and published in 1887 as <hi rend="italic">Aufsätze zur persischen
                  Geschichte</hi> (Essays on Persian history). Additional fields of Nöldeke’s
               research were comparative Semitic linguistics and Old Testament.</p>
                    <p>Characteristic for Nöldeke are his sober assessment and his common sense. He saw
               himself as a ‘rationalist’, limiting himself to what could be ascertained and
               avoiding unprovable hypotheses or speculations. Eastern mysticism remained utterly
               foreign to him.</p>
                    <p>Nöldeke was among the most significant scholars of Near Eastern studies of his day
               even though due to poor health he never was able to visit the Middle East. Through
               him, Strasbourg became a center of Near Eastern studies in Germany. He had many
               students, including from abroad; he maintained contacts with many scholars and
               enjoyed international esteem. For his seventieth birthday, a Festschrift was
               published, of more than 1200 pages, to which 85 colleagues contributed from all over
               the world (with photograph). A second Festschrift followed in 1916 for his eightieth
               birthday.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Polemicist, scholar, and deacon. Details concerning Nonos’s life appear in several
               Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, and Georgian works. These sources focus on four incidents.
               The most celebrated is Nonos’s disputation with <ref rend="bold">Theodoros Abū
                  Qurra</ref>. Ca. 815 Nonos’s relative Abū Rāʾiṭa, the Miaphysite Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref>, sent Nonos to the court of the Armenian prince Ashot
               Msaker to debate against the Melkite Abū Qurra. Later chronicles often attribute
               Armenia’s continuing support of the Miaphysite cause to Nonos’s success in this
               encounter. Nonos next appears in 827 or 828 at the Council of <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref> where his testimony resulted in the council deposing Philoxenos
               bp. of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>. It is unclear what the charges against
               Philoxenos were; a letter from the Patr. <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref>
               simply refers to ‘abominations.’ From both external sources and from Nonos’s own
               writings we learn that, under the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil, Nonos was imprisoned
               from ca. 856 until 861. Also with him were Toma, the E.-Syr. Metropolitan of <ref rend="bold">Beth Garmai</ref>, and Toma’s brother Theodosios, who had recently
               become Cath. Nonos wrote his four surviving Syriac works while in prison. After
               al-Mutawakkil’s death, Nonos was released. The final recorded incident in Nonos’s
               life is his attendance at the Armenian council of Shirakawan in 862.</p>
                    <p>Five texts by Nonos remain extant. The longest is his Commentary on John, preserved
               in Armenian. In 1920 Crakhean published an edition of this text based on two mss. now
               found in Venice. According to the incipit, Nonos originally composed his commentary
               in Arabic. The Syriac ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,594 which <ref rend="bold">Mushe
                  of Nisibis</ref> obtained for the monastery of <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>
               in 932 provides the sole witness to Nonos’s Syriac writings. This manuscript
               preserves: 1. an apologetic treatise on the trinity and the incarnation; 2. a
               four-discourse work written against the metropolitan Toma; 3. Nonos’s response to an
               anonymous inquiry regarding trinitarian and incarnational theology; and 4. a letter
               responding to christological questions sent to Nonos by a monk named Yuḥanon. In 1948
               Van Roey published an edition and Latin translation of the first of these works in
               which Nonos provides brief answers to the theological challenges raised most
               frequently by contemporary Muslims. Nonos’s other Syriac works remain unedited.</p>

                    <p>Educator and modern reformer. He was born Ibrahīm Kahlajī (later Syriacized his name
               to Abrohom Nuro) in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, then migrated to <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> with the massive Edessan exodus of 1924. In 1946 he joined the
               University of St. Joseph, Lebanon, and studied law, only to withdraw in the final
               year due to illness. From the 1950s he began to work in the field of Syriac,
               especially teaching the language, and was the first to introduce <ref rend="bold">Kthobonoyo Syriac</ref> as the spoken language at home (first with his sisters,
               and much later in life with his wife). He lived in <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref> from
               1964 until 1982 where he taught Syriac at <ref rend="bold">Taw Mim Simkath</ref>
               School, 1970–71 (and earlier in the 1940s), Kaslik (1967–68). After 1943 he organized
               more than 45 Syriac-language evening courses in Aleppo, Beirut, Qamishli, and the
                  <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref>. He developed an audio-visual
               pedagogical method called <hi rend="italic">Suloqo</hi>, later published in book
               form. His reform proposals include printing Syriac in separate letters (<hi rend="italic">al-Isṭrangiliyya al-Mustaqilla</hi> with Karim Shahan [Beirut,
               1967]), a partial vocalization system for schools (see <hi rend="italic">Suloko
               </hi>[Holland, 1989]), and hundreds of neologisms for modern technical terms, many of
               which are now standard in Kthobonoyo Syriac (see <hi rend="italic">Tawldotho</hi>
               1997, and the appendix to Manna’s dictionary [2nd ed. 1975]). In 1967, he published
                  <hi rend="italic">My Tour</hi>, a report on the state of the Syr. Orth. Church,
               but also rich with pictures of Syriac scholars from <ref rend="bold">Joseph Assemani
               </ref>(1687–1768) to <ref rend="bold">Nöldeke</ref> (1836–1930). His private library is
               rich with books published in the Middle East during the 1800s and 1900s, most of
               which were acquired by G. Kiraz and the Beth Mardutho Library. His unpublished works
               include a checklist of the Syriac books in his collection and various studies in

                    <p>The <ref rend="bold">Syriac language</ref> is best known from the large corpus of
               Christian literature that began to be produced by the 2nd-cent. and continues to be
               composed until the present day. Syriac is, however, also attested in a much smaller
               corpus of non-Christian documentary texts that date from the 1st to the 3rd cent.
               These texts are traditionally termed ‘Old Syriac’. The largest group of Old Syriac
               texts are <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref>, which number over 100 (ed. Drijvers and
               Healey). In addition to the Old Syriac inscriptions, there are also the Old Syriac
               documents, which include three Syriac parchments as well as several Syriac texts
               found on (primarily) Greek documents from the Middle Euphrates region.</p>
                    <p>The first of the Old Syriac parchments was discovered in 1933 during excavations of
                  <ref rend="bold">Dura-Europos</ref>, an important military outpost for the Parthian
               Empire and then the Roman Empire on the Euphrates. This document, which is now known
               as P. Dura 28, is a bill of sale for a female slave dated 9 May 243 (the most
               accessible version of the text is in Drijvers and Healey, 232–6 [s.v. P1]; but see
               also Bellinger and Welles; Goldstein; Healey 2009, 264–75 [with plate 9]; Torrey;
               Welles, Fink, and Gilliam, 142–9 [with pl. LXIX, LXXI]; plates are also found in
               Moller, 185–6). In addition to this Syriac parchment, more than 150 other documents
               were found at Dura-Europos, most of which are in Greek or Latin though there are also
               a few in Iranian or Aramaic (ed. Welles, Fink, and Gilliam). For more than fifty
               years, P. Dura 28 was without parallel, but in 1988 two similar Old Syriac
               parchments, now known as P.  Euphrates 19 and 20, came to light. Though not found in
               controlled excavations, it is likely that both of these documents originate from
               Appadana (Neapolis), just north of Dura-Europos on the Euphrates. P. Euphrates 19 is
               a transfer of debt dated 28 Dec. 240 (the most accessible version of the text is in
               Drijvers and Healey, 237–42 [s.v. P2], but see also Teixidor 1989, 220; 1990, 144–54
               [includes two plates]; Brock; Aggoula; Healey 2008; 2009, 252–64 [with plate 8]). P.
               Euphrates  20 is a property lease dated 1 Sept. 242 (the most accessible version of
               the text is in Drijvers and Healey, 243–8 [s.v. P3]; see also Teixidor 1989; 1990,
               154–57; 1991–1992 [includes two plates]; Brock; Aggoula). These two Syriac parchments
               belong to a cache of texts that also includes 19 Greek papyri and parchments (ed.
               Feissel and Gascou [and Teixidor]). On several of these Greek texts, there is
               additional writing in Syriac. P. Euphrates 6 (with its duplicate P. Euphrates 7), for
               instance, contains a bill of sale for a slave in Greek, which is followed by seven
               lines of Syriac summarizing the sale as well as a list of witnesses and guarantors
               (verso), both in Syriac. In addition, a Syriac subscription occurs on two of the
               Greek papyri, viz. P. Euphrates 3 and its duplicate P. Euphrates 4. This subscription
               is the earliest witness to the use of Syriac on papyrus (see <ref rend="bold">Papyri,
                  Syriac</ref>).</p>
                    <p>Since their discovery, the Old Syriac documents have proven important on a number of
               fronts. In both their content and form they have added to the growing body of data
               for the Aramaic legal tradition. The three Old Syriac parchments are of the <hi rend="italic">Doppelurkunde-</hi>type, in which the main text is presented on the
               lower portion of the parchment and an abbreviated summary occurs on the top. This top
               section would have originally been rolled up and sealed in order to prevent
               tampering. This practice is well attested both in Greek and Aramaic papyrology, and
               it may have antecedents in the cuneiform tradition where tablets were enclosed in
               clay envelopes. The legal terminology in the Old Syriac parchments also points to
               continuity with other Aramaic legal texts, such as the Elephantine papyri, the
               Samaria Papyri, the Nabataean papyri, and the Jewish legal texts from the Judaean
               desert and the ‘Cave of Letters’ in Naḥal Ḥever (see Healey 2005). In P. Dura 28, for
               instance, it is stated: ‘From today until forever, you, Tiro, the buyer, and your
               heirs will have authority (<hi rend="italic">šlyṭ</hi>) over this female slave whom I
               have sold to you, to possess or to sell or to do with her whatever you wish (<hi rend="italic">kl d-tṣbʾ</hi>)’ (ln. 11–12). This type of statement — commonly
               called a <hi rend="italic">Kyrieia</hi>-clause  — is found throughout the Aramaic
               legal tradition, as well as in Greek papyri.</p>
                    <p>The dating formulae in the Old Syriac documents has provided valuable information for
               the chronology of the last kings of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (see <ref rend="bold">Abgarids</ref>). P. Dura 28 shows that the Abgarid dynasty must have come to an
               end in 212/213 when the city became a Roman <hi rend="italic">colonia</hi>. On the
               basis of P. Euphrates 19, which states that 28 Dec. 240 is the 2nd year of king
               Abgar, it can be established that the dynasty was restored in 239 (or late 238) under
               Abgar X, son of Maʿnu. Finally, it seems that Edessa must have reverted to a <hi rend="italic">colonia</hi>by 242 on the basis of P. Euphrates 20, which gives 1
               Sept. 242 as year 30 of the <hi rend="italic">colonia</hi>.</p>
                    <p>The Old Syriac documents are also an important witness to an early stage of the
               Syriac language. The <ref rend="bold">script</ref> of the Old Syriac documents is not
               the monumental Esṭrangela that is found in most of the Old Syriac inscriptions and
               the oldest Syriac literary mss., but rather it is of a more cursive type (especially
               in P. Euphrates 20) that also occurs in some mosaic inscriptions. These documents,
               thus, corroborate the existence of a cursive script, which was used alongside
               Esṭrangela already in the earliest period of Syriac and which would later develop
               into Serṭo (see Healey 2000). In orthography, the Old Syriac documents have features
               in common with the Old Syriac inscriptions, but different from Classical Syriac, e.g.
               the defective writing of historical short *<hi rend="italic">u</hi> (e.g. <hi rend="italic">ḥšbn</hi> ‘reckoning’) versus the plene writing with a <hi rend="italic">mater lectionis</hi> in Classical Syriac (e.g. <hi rend="italic">ḥwšbn</hi>) and the representation of the etymological lateral *<hi rend="italic">ɬ</hi> (= traditional <hi rend="italic">ś</hi>) with <hi rend="italic">š</hi>
               (e.g. <hi rend="italic">ʿšryn</hi> ‘twenty’) versus <hi rend="italic">s</hi> in
               Classical Syriac (e.g. <hi rend="italic">ʿsryn</hi>). In one important diagnostic
               feature, however, the Old Syriac documents differ from most of the Old Syriac
               inscriptions in agreement with Classical Syriac: the prefix marker of the 3rd-person
               masculine prefix-conjugation is <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in most of the Old Syriac
               inscriptions, but <hi rend="italic">n</hi> in both the Old Syriac documents and
               Classical Syriac. This shows that there was already linguistic variation in Old
               Syriac (see recently Healey 2008). Finally, the Old Syriac documents provide evidence
               for Syriac-Greek language contact already in the middle of the 3rd cent. as there are
               a relatively large number of Greek lexical borrowings (20 types that occur more than
               50 times) in the documents, several of which show a significant degree of
               incorporation into the Syriac language, e.g. <hi rend="italic">ʾsṭrṭgwtʾ
               </hi>‘strategos-ship’ (&lt; Greek <hi rend="italic">stratēgós</hi>)and <hi rend="italic">ʾrkwnwtʾ</hi>‘archon-ship’ (&lt; Greek <hi rend="italic">árchōn</hi>).</p>

               term is restricted to the two mentioned Gospel mss. only. The Old Syriac Version is
               the earliest representative of the four-Gospel NT in the Syriac speaking area East of
                  <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>. As <hi rend="italic">ewangeliyon da-mparrše</hi>
               (‘Gospel of the separate ones [i.e., books]’) it circulated beside the Diatessaron
                  (<hi rend="italic">ewangeliyon da-mḥallṭe</hi>, ‘Gospel of the mixed ones [i.e.,

                  Museum</hi>, vol. 1, no. CXIX, ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,451) is named after
                  <ref rend="bold">W. Cureton</ref>, who identified the version and prepared the first
               edition in 1858. It is based on the 87 parchment folios which came to the British
               Museum in 1842–47 from <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in the Nitrian Desert
               (Egypt). The definitive edition, prepared by F. C. Burkitt (1904) includes three
               further leaves preserved at Berlin (Orient. Quart. 528, first ed. by E.  Roediger
               1872) and gives the deviations of the Sinaitic ms. in the footnotes. One additional
               folio (still at Dayr al-Suryān) was published by D. McConaughy in 1987. The unusual
               sequence of the Gospels in this 5th-cent. codex is Mt, Mk, Jn, Lk. The text of the
               present-day ms. is Mt 1:1–8:22; 10:32–23:25; Mk 16:17–20 (Mk almost completely lost);
               Jn 1:1–42; 3:5–8:19; 14:10–2, 15–9, 21–4, 26–9; Lk 2:48–3:16; 7:33–15:21;
               17:24–24:44. The three folios in Berlin: Jn 7:37–8:19; Lk 15:22–16:12; 17:1–23; the
               single folio published by D. McConaughy: Lk 16:13–17:1.</p>
                    <p>The ‘Sinaitic ms.’ (‘S’; ms. Sin. Syr. 30; Hatch, <hi rend="italic">Album</hi>, plate
               XLVI) Agnes Smith Lewis and her twin sister Margaret D. Gibson discovered in 1892
               during a visit at <ref rend="bold">St. Catherine Monastery</ref> at Mount Sinai. This
               4th/5th-cent. codex is a palimpsest, the original Gospel text was removed in the 8th
               cent. to reuse the parchment for the history of female saints. R. L. Bensly, J. R.
               Harris, and F. C. Burkitt assisted A. S. Lewis in the difficult decipherment of the
               under-writing, which required five additional journeys to St. Catharine and the
               application of a reagent. In 1894 the team of scholars published the palimpsest; some
               re-examined folios with improved readings followed in 1896. The standard edition of
               the Sinaitic ms. with further improvements and much additional material was published
               by A. S. Lewis in 1910, now with the deviations of Codex Curetonianus in the
               footnotes. The surviving 142 leaves preserve the text of Mt 1:1–6:10; 8:3–12:4, 6–25,
               30–16:15; 17:11–20:24; 21:20–25:15, 17–20, 25–26, 32–28:7; Mk 1:12–44; 2:21–4:17,
               41–5:26; 6:5–16:8; Lk 1:1–16, 38–5:28; 6:12–24:52; Jn 1:25–47; 2:16–4:37; 5:6–25,
               46–18:31; 19:40–21:25. Some passages in Mt are partially illegible. Ultra-violet
               photography applied to the codex by K. and B. Aland in 1982 failed to decipher
               additional portions of the text.</p>
                    <p>The relation between C and S is not definitely settled. On the one hand, both mss.
               are too different to be copies of the same text; on the other, their agreements
               exclude the possibility of two different translations of the Greek. They are rather
               independent traditions of the same version and reflect a revisional development. This
               would imply a longer period of revision and allow for the possibility of originally
               more than two independent traditions side by side.</p>
                    <p>The date and origin of the Old Syriac Version are disputed too. The introduction of
               the Four-Gospel canon is certainly due to Western influence and corresponds with the
               advance of ‘orthodox’ Graeco-Roman theology and organization to Syria and
               Mesopotamia. This makes Antioch and Northern Palestine more probable as the place of
               origin than <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>. The Old Syriac Version came into being in an
               area dominated by the Diatessaron, since ca. 170, which was replaced by the
               Four-Gospel canon only in the 5th cent. The first attempts to produce Separate
               Gospels may have started in the 3rd cent., and the archetype of C and S may
               tentatively be traced to these early efforts; however, the introduction of the
               Four-Gospel canon as the approved NT in the area East of Antioch cannot be dated
               earlier than the 4th/5th cent. The Four-Gospel canon was definitely settled in the
               time of <ref rend="bold">Rabbula</ref> by a thorough revision of the Old Syriac textual
               traditions, which resulted in the Peshitta.</p>
                    <p>Quotations of the Old Syriac type are in the writings of Aphrahaṭ, Ephrem, in the
               ‘Book of Steps’, and in a few additional documents; they are collected by Burkitt,
               Leloir, and Kerschensteiner. Here the qualification ‘Old Syriac’ refers to the
               pre-Peshitta origin of the texts. In the Gospels comparison with C, S, and the
               Peshitta is possible; outside of the Gospels, where there is no direct attestation in
               Old Syriac mss., solely the Peshitta can be compared. It is not certain whether these
               quotations reflect an established Old Syriac Version or individual attempts of
               translation. In the Gospels the Diatessaron is quoted side by side with the Separate
               Gospels (labelled as ‘the Greek’ by Ephrem); this may reflect the dominance of the
               Diatessaron and the circulation of Old Syriac textual traditions in the 4th cent.
               According to Ephrem’s commentary on the Pauline epistles (preserved in Armenian), an
               additional (3rd) epistle to the Corinthians was part of the Old Syriac NT canon. The
               Catholic Epistles probably were not included in the canon; although 1 Pet and 1 Jn
               are known, they are never qualified as ‘Scripture.’</p>
                    <p>The Old Syriac heritage of early Peshitta mss. is a minor source of the Old Syriac
               Version and still awaiting exploitation. This heritage derives from the Old Syriac
               prehistory of the Peshitta and was set out in some detail by A.  Allgeier (1932) and
               A. Juckel (2003). M. Black launched the hypothesis of a ‘Pre-Peshitta’ (1952),
               produced by Rabbula and closer to the Old Syriac than the definitive Peshitta. From
               this Pre-Peshitta remaining Old Syriac elements were successively (though
               insufficiently) eliminated by further revision. Whatever the role of Rabbula in this
               context may be, the agreement of the definitively revised Peshitta with the Old
               Syriac is striking. Majority readings as well as minority readings (represented by
               single or several mss. only) of the definitive Peshitta participate in this
               agreement. Access to this source of the Old Syriac Version is given by the collation
               of Peshitta mss. presented in the Gospel volume prepared by Ph. E.  Pusey / G. H.
               Gwilliam (1901). Among these mss. Codex Phillipps 1388 (5th/6th cent.) is the most
               prominent witness. Further collations are necessary to exploit this source of the Old
               Syriac Version sufficiently in order to reconstruct the pre-Peshitta as far as
               possible.</p>

                    <p>Poetic genre which flourished in late E.-Syr. hymnography. In earlier periods, the
               term <hi rend="italic">ʿonithā</hi> (pl. <hi rend="italic">ʿonyāthā</hi>) indicates
               the antiphonal response to psalms or the refrain of a <hi rend="italic">madrāšā</hi>
               (see <ref rend="bold">Poetry</ref>), ranging from one line to a full verse. The late
                  <hi rend="italic">ʿonyāthā</hi> are liturgical hymns characterized by a tripartite
               structure: prologues and epilogues contain lines of various length, whereas the main
               text is structured in verses of a fixed number of isosyllabic lines. Generally a
               verse consists of four rhymed seven-syllable lines. Verses and/or lines are often
               connected by alphabetic acrostics or other stylistic artifices.</p>
                    <p>Being used during the daily service or celebration of the Eucharist, <hi rend="italic">ʿonyāthā</hi> deal with various subjects: penitence, feasts of the
               liturgical year, praise of saints and martyrs, commemoration or prayer occasioned by
               dramatic events (war, famine, pestilence).</p>
                    <p>
                        <ref rend="bold">Gewargis Warda</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Khamis bar Qardaḥe</ref> are
               considered masters of the genre. Long <hi rend="italic">ʿonyāthā</hi> of
               historical-celebrative content were composed by <ref rend="bold">Gabriel Qamṣa</ref>
               (Metr. of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, 2nd half of the 13th cent.) and Brikhishoʿ bar
               Eshkafe (abbot of Beth Qoqa, 14th cent.?). The <hi rend="italic">ʿonitha</hi> had its
               natural continuation in the <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref> genre of the <ref rend="bold">dorekthā</ref>.</p>

                    <p>Palimpsest is the term used for a parchment ms. that has been written on twice (or
               rarely, more times), where the original script has been erased. A very high
               proportion of the older surviving texts in <ref rend="bold">Christian Palestinian
                  Aramaic</ref> (CPA) are under texts in palimpsests. Palimpsests where Syriac is
               the upper text mostly date between 9th and 12th cent.; the under text may be in a
               variety of different languages, Greek, Latin, Armenian, Coptic, CPA, as well as an
               earlier Syriac text. Two particularly notable examples are ms. Sinai Syr. 30 (upper
               text, probably dated 779: Lives of holy women; lower: <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac</ref>
               Gospels, <ref rend="bold">Acts of Thomas</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> Graecus);
               and ms. Vatican Syr. 623 (upper, 886: 40 Martyrs of Sinai, etc.; lower: Syriac
               translation of <ref rend="bold">Galen</ref> and of <ref rend="bold">Menander</ref>’s
               Dyskolos, as well as texts in Arabic, Armenian, CPA, and Greek). A number of Syriac
               mss. in the British Library have remarkable undertexts, e.g. Add. 14,512 (the oldest
               dated biblical ms. in any language; Isaiah, 459/60); Add. 14,574 and 14,623 (Ephrem,
               Prose Refutations); Add. 17,210–11, copied in the Monastery of Shemʿun, Qartmin ca.
               800 (Homer, Euclid).</p>
                    <p>Syriac, and especially CPA, may also be the under text where the upper text is in
               other languages, Greek, Arabic, Georgian, or Hebrew. Very occasionally manuscripts
               are doubly palimpsest (e.g. ms. Sinai Arabic 514).</p>

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>. Elected around the middle of the 3rd
               cent., Papa’s tenure is said to have lasted until a few years after the Council of
               Nicea (325). <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> reports that either Papa himself or his
               disciple and later successor <ref rend="bold">Shemʿon bar Ṣabbaʿe</ref> attended the
               Council of Nicea, but there is no corroboration for this claim. Widely discussed in
               many sources, both Syriac and Arabic, is an event that took place most likely around
               325. All sources agree that there was a conflict between Papa and some other Syriac
               bishops in the Persian Empire. It may have had to do with Papa’s efforts to establish
               his primacy, or with the way in which he exerted his power as the bp. of the empire’s
               leading city. The main spokesman of Papa’s opponents was Miles, bp. of Susa (martyred
               in 345). The Acts of Miles speak about the incident in terms very unfavorable to
               Papa; the report by bp. Agapetos of <ref rend="bold">Beth Lapaṭ</ref>, which is
               included in the Synod of <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ</ref> (424), takes Papa’s side and
               is negative about Miles; Bar ʿEbroyo’s summary report is neutral and dispassionate.
               Upset about the accusations that Miles brought forth against him at the synod, Papa
               is said to have struck the Gospel book in front of him, either in an act of despair
               or in contempt and defiance. As a result his hand was paralyzed. The sources disagree
               about whether Papa subsequently was deposed and about how long he lived after the
               incident. Agapetos used the incident around Papa in his defense of Cath. Dadishoʿ and
               described the conflict as resulting from the rebellion by Miles and others (similar,
               in his view, to the rebellion in Dadishoʿ’s day). Agapetos mentioned, and even quoted
               from, letters from the West, which were sent in Papa’s support and led to his
               rehabilitation. Bar ʿEbroyo also knew of these letters, but doubted their
               authenticity and pointed to Cath. <ref rend="bold">Yawsep</ref> as their possible
               author. These letters, expressing support for Papa, are preserved among a collection
               of 8 letters (some written by Papa and others addressed to him), transmitted in the
                  <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref> and translated into German by Braun. They
               are attributed to <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, and ‘the Western Fathers’. In Demonstration XIV, traditionally
               attributed to <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, the author complains about the abusive
               leadership in the Church and about the crowned head who was rejected by his own
               people and found support with foreign leaders. Some scholars (most recently Fiey)
               have seen this as a description of Papa’s leadership. If indeed Papa were the subject
               of this diatribe, the traditional date for this Demonstration (343/4) would have to
               be rejected, and the text would have to be separated from the original list of
               Aphrahaṭ’s twenty-two Demonstrations. The author’s view on Papa would be closer to
               that expressed in the Acts of Miles than to the one endorsed by Agapetos in the Synod
               of 424.</p>

                    <p>Throughout its long history (more than two millennia), the <ref rend="bold">Syriac
                  language</ref>has been written on a variety of different mediums. The two most
               common are parchment for the early period and paper for the later period (see <ref rend="bold">Manuscripts</ref>). Syriac has, however, also been set in tile mosaic,
               inked onto stoneware, and incised into stone, wood, and metal. In addition, Syriac
               has occasionally been written on papyrus.</p>
                    <p>The earliest surviving example of Syriac written on papyrus is associated with the
               three 3rd-cent. Syriac parchments (see <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac documents</ref>).
               While all three of these documents are parchments, the two from the Middle Euphrates
               region were found with a cache of Greek texts, some of which are papyri. On two of
               these papyri (viz. P. Euphrates 3 and 4), the following writing in Syriac occurs
               after the Greek text of the petition: <hi rend="italic">ʾwrls ʿbšwṭʾ ktbt</hi>‘I, PN,
               sign’ (ed. Feissel and Gascou, 94–107).</p>
                    <p>The only Syriac documentary text written on papyrus that has yet been edited is a
               partially-preserved letter possibly from the 7th cent. (P. Berol. Inv. 8285; ed.
               Brashear 96–100 with pl. XIII; important corrections in Brock 1999). Though the
               context of the text is not entirely clear due to its state of preservation, the
               writer of the letter seems to be a person in authority who is addressing an inferior.
               The text is written in a cursive <ref rend="bold">script</ref> similar to Serṭo.</p>
                    <p>In addition to documentary texts, literary texts were also written in Syriac on
               papyrus. In 1985, J.-M. Sauget published a single folio of a papyrus fragment
               conserved in Florence (PSI Inv. 3020). This fragment, which he dated to the 9th
               cent., contains a section of the <ref rend="bold">Didascalia Apostolorum</ref>. In
               1995, S. P. Brock identified an additional papyrus folio of the same text in the
               Schøyen collection (no. 1644/1; ed. Brock 1995, 9–14). At one time, these two folios,
               which follow one another sequentially, must have belonged to a single papyrus ms. In
               addition to the Didascalia Apostolorum, the Schøyen fragment also contains a text by
               a certain Mar Yoʾanis, who may possibly be <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref>.</p>
                    <p>An additional fragmentary Syriac papyrus is found among the holdings of the Schøyen
               collection (no. 1644/2; ed. Brock 1995, 18–22). This fragment, which again may date
               from the 9th cent., contains the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> version of Acts
               8:40–9:14 (recto) and Acts 9:16–9:27 (verso).</p>
                    <p>Among the many textual finds from Kellis in the Dakhla Oasis are several Manichaean
               Syriac papyri, now labeled P. KellisSyr. 1, which almost certainly consists of three
               distinct papyri (ed. in Gardner, vol. 1, 127–8 with pl. 19), and P. KellisSyr. 2 (ed.
               in Gardner, vol. 2, 136–137 with pl. 38). According to the editors, these papyri are
               probably literary, but their current fragmentary state mitigates any further
               description or identification. In addition to these monolingual Syriac papyri, a
               personal name is written in Syriac on the verso of a Greek letter on papyrus from
               Kellis (P. KellisGr. 67; see Gardner 2007). Along with the Syriac-Coptic glossaries
               on wood boards, these Syriac papyri — and the Syriac address on a Greek papyrus —
               point to the use of Syriac in the Manichaean community at Kellis.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these texts, which have been edited, a number of other Syriac papyri
               are known to exist. In 1975, ca. 50 Syriac papyrus fragments were found at the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of St. Catherine</ref>(see Digbassanis). Most of the papyri
               are said to date from the 5th–7th cent., and at least two contain sections of the OT.
               In 1998, a number of Syriac papyrus fragments were found at <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  al-Suryān</ref>in Egypt, a monastery which is well-known for having provided a
               large number of early Syriac mss. According to Bigoul el-Souriany and Van Rompay, the
               Dayr al-Suryān papyrus fragments most likely come from a codex that contained an as
               of yet unidentified ascetical text. Based on paleography, a 9th cent. date has been
               tentatively suggested, though a (slightly) earlier date cannot be ruled out.
               Alongside these two larger caches, a few Syriac papyri are also said to be found in
               collections in Oxford (Bodleian Library), Vienna, Heidelberg, and Cheltenham (for
               full references, see Brashear, 91 n. 24).</p>
                    <p>While their number pales in comparison to the thousands of Syriac texts on parchment
               and paper, the Syriac papyri add yet a further dimension to Syriac language and
               writing. The Syriac papyri also speak directly to Syriac’s continuity with the
               earlier <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref> heritage. Aramaic papyri survive from as early
               as the mid-6th cent. BC. The Syriac papyri then represent the last stage of a long
               tradition of writing Aramaic on papyrus.</p>

               the black (ones)’ (<hi rend="italic">Melanos</hi>, sing., or <hi rend="italic">Melanōn</hi>, plur.). He was elected patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> in a
               period when the Miaphysites of Syria and Egypt were working closely together in their
               resistance to the Chalcedonian doctrine of the Imperial Church. After the death of
                  <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> (d. 538), <ref rend="bold">Theodosius of
                  Alexandria</ref> assumed the leadership of the Miaphysites, even while living as
               an exile in Constantinople. It was only in the late 550s that the Syr. Miaphysites
               proceeded with the election of their own leader, first Sergius, who had a short
               tenure (ca. 557–60), and then, a few years later, Pawlos (who was elected in 564, at
               the instigation of Patr. Theodosius). Pawlos, who had worked with Theodosius, was a
               native of Alexandria; prior to his election he may have spent some time in Syria as a
               monk (Honigmann, 196). Once elected he may have had the ambition of exerting
               leadership over both the Syrian and Egyptian Churches, as the follower of Theodosius
               (d. 566), but he found little support. In 571, in a time when the Miaphysites were
               oppressed by the Chalcedonians, Pawlos is said to have temporarily accepted communion
               with the Chalcedonians, an act which he later regretted and for which he had to
               accept a three-year penitence in order to be fully rehabilitated. In 575 he played a
               role in the election and formal recognition of a Syrian monk, Theodorus (who had
               lived for several years in Scetis) as patr. of Alexandria. The Alexandrians, however,
               rejected Theodorus, and a different candidate was elected to the see of Alexandria,
               Peter (IV, 575–77). For what he saw as Pawlos’s unlawful intervention in the election
               process, Peter issued the deposal of Pawlos, and a schism between the two
               patriarchates broke out. That this did not have nationalist undertones is clear from
               the fact that Peter had a Syrian secretary in Damian (who was from <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, the city he visited in the fall of 579), who only two years later
               became Peter’s successor in Alexandria. Within the Syrian Miaphysite community, the
               schism created bitter opposition between Pawlos’s staunch supporters and those who,
               for a variety of reasons, withdrew their support from Pawlos. Among the latter was
                  <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref>. The Syrian Miaphysite community thus became
               divided between ‘Paulists’ (or Paulianists, Greek <hi rend="italic">Paulianistai</hi>, Syriac <hi rend="italic">Beth Pawlo</hi>) and ‘Jacobites’. Pawlos
               himself withdrew to Constantinople, where he spent the last years of his life in
               relative isolation. When following the death of Pawlos (581), <ref rend="bold">Peter of
                  Kallinikos</ref> was elected the new patr. of Antioch, the peace between the two
               patriarchates lasted for only a few years. For, starting in the mid-580s, Peter of
               Kallinikos and Damian became involved in a new conflict, in which this time the
               theological problem of ‘Tritheism’ was central and led to another schism. This would
               only be healed under <ref rend="bold">Athanasios Gamolo</ref> in 616.</p>
                    <p>Among Pawlos’s writings, some letters and official statements have been preserved:
               his synodical letter to Theodosius (Syr. in CSCO 17, 98–114; LT in CSCO 103, 68–79);
               a letter to Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo and to Theodorus (Syr. in CSCO 17, 177–9; LT in CSCO 103,
               123–5); Pawlos’s synodical letter to Patr. Theodorus (Syr. in CSCO 17, 308–34; LT in
               CSCO 103, 215–33); as well as some additional fragments (see <hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> and Suppl.). A short document refuting the positions of the Paulists and
               defending the judgments and actions of Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo has recently been published by
               Lontie. Information on Pawlos and on the situation of the Syr. Orth. in the 2nd half
               of the 6th cent. is found in the main W.-Syr. historiographical works (among which
               the Ecclesiastical History of the contemporary witness <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of
                  Ephesus</ref> stands out). Many official and semi-official documents of the Syr.
               Orth Church in the 6th cent. are preserved in a collection (ms. Brit. Libr. Add.
               14,602, late 6th or early 7th cent.) that its editor, J.-B. Chabot named ‘Documenta
               ad origines Monophysitarum illustrandas’.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of Kallinikos; translator of works of <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref>.
               Pawlos must have become bp. no later than Aug. 509, at which time he is mentioned as
               bp. in an inscription on a mosaic floor in Tall Biʿa, near Kallinikos (Krebernik).
               His tenure as bp. came to an end in 519, when he was among the 52 Miaphysite bps. who
               were expelled from their see following the implementation of a new Chalcedonian
               policy by Emperor Justin I.</p>
                    <p>Pawlos is explicitly mentioned as the translator of Severus’s writings against <ref rend="bold">Julian Halicarnassus</ref> in a note at the end of ms. Vat. Syr. 140
               (6th cent.), the main witness for these writings. That this ms. might be Pawlos’s
               autograph, as Baumstark speculated, is unlikely (Draguet, 13, note 6; and Hespel, in
               CSCO 295, iii); most scholars nowadays take the date of 528, provided in the note
               (which is in a different hand from that of the rest of the ms.), for the date of the
               completion of the original translation, rather than that of the ms. With Pawlos’s
               authorship of the Syriac version of the anti-Julianist dossier firmly established,
               several scholars have suggested that Pawlos may have translated other works by
               Severus as well. While King has made a strong case for attributing the Syriac
               translation of Severus’s Philalethes to Pawlos (King 2007 and 2008, 176–7), there is
               little evidence for seeing Pawlos as the translator of other works, such as the
               Cathedral Homilies (the 6th-cent. translation of which was later revised by <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>).</p>
                    <p>Even if we are unable to determine Pawlos’s contribution with precision, he certainly
               belonged to the small circle of Miaphysite intellectuals who in the crucial period of
               the first quarter of the 6th cent. embarked on a major translation project, for which
               they applied standards that were more rigorous than those prevalent in the earlier
               period, without becoming ‘so obsessively calque-esque’ (King 2008, 385) as those that
               characterized the 7th-cent. translations (in general, see <ref rend="bold">Greek,
                  Syriac translations from)</ref>.</p>

               teacher. As metropolitan bp. of Nisibis, Pawlos attended the Synod convened by Cath.
                  <ref rend="bold">Yawsep</ref> in 554 and signed the acts. He played an important
               role in the deposition of Yawsep, probably in 567, and, according to the Chronicle of
                  <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref>, he had to cope with problems arising in the <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref>, involving the newly arrived teacher <ref rend="bold">Ḥenana</ref>of <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref>. In the war between the
               Byzantine and Persian Empires, which broke out in 572, Pawlos is said to have
               supported Byzantine efforts to reconquer the city of Nisibis. When this failed, his
               death saved him from deposition and further humiliation.</p>
                    <p>Soon after 561, the Persian emperor Khusrau sent Pawlos, along with some other
               E.-Syr. theologians, to Constantinople. Of the official theological discussion,
               arranged by the emperor Justinian, Pawlos wrote a report that is preserved in a
               W.-Syr. ms. of Monothelete provenance. It was published and studied by Guillaumont,
               who argued that in this text the concept of the two hypostases (<hi rend="italic">qnome</hi>) in Christ is mentioned for the first time. This concept was later
               generally accepted in E.-Syr. Christology.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Itinerant E.-Syr. scholar. Pawlos is primarily known through a mid-6th-cent. Latin
               manual of biblical interpretation, authored by Junillus Africanus. Junillus names as
               his main authority ‘a certain man called Pawlos, a Persian by origin, who was
               educated at the Syrian School in the city of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>’ (Preface).
               This Pawlos is said to have written a biblical manual in Greek, which Junillus claims
               to have used extensively. Scholars had noticed that Junillus’s handbook did indeed
               reflect many of the themes and approaches known from the <ref rend="bold">School of
                  Nisibis</ref> and often traceable to <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>.
               Junillus’s handbook was, therefore, seen as a more or less faithful translation of
               Pawlos’s work. The most recent analysis of the work, however, by Maas and Mathews,
               depicts Junillus as a more independent author (‘neither a passive translator of
               Pawlos the Persian nor a mouthpiece for the School of Nisibis’, 11), who relied only
               loosely on Pawlos’s work.</p>
                    <p>It may have been the same Pawlos who had a debate with a Manichaean in Constantinople
               in 527. The text of this is preserved in Greek, along with the refutation of a
               pamphlet written by (probably) the same Manichaean. Scholars in the past also tried
               to fuse Pawlos’s identity with that of <ref rend="bold">Pawlos of Nisibis</ref> or <ref rend="bold">Pawlos the Philosopher</ref>. For reasons of chronology and content it
               seems wiser to distinguish between the three persons named Pawlos, even though all
               three illustrate the vivid interest E.-Syr. intellectuals were showing in Greek
               culture during the age of Justinian.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Author of philosophical works. Little is known about Pawlos’s life. Two works,
               explicitly attributed to him are preserved in Syriac. The first, published and
               translated by Land and partly translated into French by Teixidor, is a treatise on
               logic. It is largely based on what the Syrians knew as <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>’s logical works, i.e., <ref rend="bold">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Eisagoge’,
               the ‘Categories’, ‘On interpretation’, and the first part of the ‘Prior Analytics’.
               The author dedicated the work to the Sasanian king Khusrau I Anushirwan (r. 531–78),
               who is known to have had a vivid interest in Greek philosophy. The second work, which
               remains unpublished, is a commentary on Aristotle’s ‘On Interpretation’. The Arab
               authors al‑Fārābī (d. 950) and Miskawayh (d. 1030) knew yet another work by Pawlos
               which, according to Gutas, must have been a general introduction into Aristotle’s
               philosophy, after the example of the Alexandrian Prolegomena.</p>
                    <p>It is uncertain in which language Pawlos wrote. A note that is preserved in two mss.
               of the commentary on ‘On interpretation’ states that Pawlos wrote the work in Persian
               and that <ref rend="bold">Severos Sebokht</ref> (d. 666/7) translated it into Syriac.
               The treatise dedicated to Khusrau may also have been written originally in Persian.
               The question of whether Pawlos read the Aristotelian writings in Greek or in Syriac,
               and where he received his philosophical training cannot, in the present state of our
               knowledge, be answered. One further detail of Pawlos’s life, the veracity of which
               cannot be confirmed, is transmitted in <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s
               ‘Ecclesiastical Chronicle’ and in the ‘Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref>’:
               after having been foiled in his attempt to become bp., Pawlos converted to
               Zoroastrianism, the official religion of the Sasanian Empire.</p>
                    <p>Clearly familiar with the tradition of Alexandrian neo-Platonism, Pawlos may have
               been an important transmitter of late-ancient philosophy to the Sasanian court, thus
               preparing the ground for the ambitious translation project of the Abbasid rulers in
               the Islamic period.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Bp. and translator. During the Persian invasion of Syria in the first decades of the
               7th cent., Pawlos found refuge in Egypt. In the <ref rend="bold">Enaton</ref>
               Monastery, near Alexandria, a team of scholars from Syria embarked on a major
               translation project. This included <ref rend="bold">Tumo of Ḥarqel</ref>, whose name is
               connected with the <ref rend="bold">Ḥarqlean</ref> version of the NT, and Pawlos of
               Tella who was responsible for the (probably first full) Syriac translation of the
               Septuagint (‘<ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref>’). According to the subscriptions of
               the Syro-Hexapla, the work was carried out between 613 and 617 (for these dates, see
               W. Baars, <hi rend="italic">New Syro-Hexaplaric Texts</hi> [1968], 1).</p>
                    <p>The possibility cannot be ruled out that Pawlos came to Egypt much earlier, but the
               evidence is rather thin. According to Honigmann, Pawlos was in the company of Tumo of
               Ḥarqel ‘and other bishops’ who in 599 were expelled from their sees during the
               persecution of Dometianus, the nephew of Emperor Maurice. Even though the name of
               Pawlos is not mentioned in the sources (e.g. <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>X.25 =
               vol. 4, 391; FT 381), a bp. of Tella is mentioned among those who returned after the
               persecution (ibid., vol. 4, 390; FT 380). If this anonymous bp. indeed would be
               Pawlos, he must have traveled back to Egypt a few years later for the second
               time.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the Syro-Hexapla, Pawlos is mentioned as the translator of a baptismal
               order attributed to <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref>, which is preserved in
               mss. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,495 (f. 68v; Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi>, vol.
               I, 228) and 14,499 (f. 65r; <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi>, vol. I, 229b–30a). An
               original Syriac <hi rend="italic">sedro</hi> composed by Pawlos exists in ms. Paris,
               Bibl. Nat. Syr. 75 (f. 134v; Zotenberg, <hi rend="italic">Catalogues</hi>, 47a). The
               Syriac translation of the pericope John 7:50–8:12 (absent from the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>and Ḥarqlean), which is sometimes attributed to Pawlos of Tella,
               probably does not belong to him, but to <ref rend="bold">Pawla of Edessa</ref>.
               Pawlos’s translation work, just as Tumo’s, is characterized by an attempt to imitate
               the morphology, syntax, and word order of the Greek original (in general, see <ref rend="bold">Greek, Syriac translations from</ref>).</p>

               an important beginning on adding materials from the many texts published after the

               Syr. Orth. parents in Kharput. Fleeing the persecution of Christians in eastern
               Turkey during World War I, he came to the USA, lived with relatives in Massachusetts,
               and graduated from Boston University in 1926. He practiced law in Paterson, New
               Jersey, specializing in immigration cases, from ca. 1935. He was one of the founders
               of the Assyrian National Federation in 1933. The theme of Perley’s writing, which was
               in English and mostly polemical, was the unity of Assyrians as one single nation
               transcending church membership and including people of E.- and W.-Syr. origin. In
               1935 he advocated union ‘under the banner of our Ethnarch, Mar <ref rend="bold">Eshai

                    <label type="subsection">The Name ‘Peshitta’</label>
                    <p>It is only in the 9th cent. that we find the first attestation of the name
               ‘Peshitta’. <ref rend="bold">Mushe bar Kipho</ref> (d. 903) uses the name in his
               Commentary on the Hexaemeron (unedited; GT in L. Schlimme [GOF I. Syriaca 14.1;
               1977], 167– 173) and his Introduction to the Psalter (ed. with GT in G. Diettrich,
                  <hi rend="italic">Eine jakobitische Einleitung</hi> [Beihefte zur ZAW 5; 1901],
               106–16). He explains that he knew of two translations in Syriac: the Peshitta, based
               on the Hebrew text, and <ref rend="bold">Pawlos of Tella</ref>’s translation from the
               Greek text of the Septuagint (see <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref>). Earlier
               references, in Syriac as well as in Greek sources, simply refer to ‘the Syrian’.</p>
                    <p>The Syriac word <hi rend="italic">pšiṭtā</hi> is the feminine passive participle of
               the verb <hi rend="italic">pšaṭ</hi> ‘to stretch out, to extend’. It presupposes the
               word <hi rend="italic">mappaqtā</hi> ‘translation’. The precise sense of this
               participle is no longer clear. In other contexts, it often means ‘simple’. As the use
               in <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> suggests, this is most probably also the sense
               when the word is applied to the Syriac Bible. Some modern scholars, however, have
               suggested other options. First, on the basis of the sense of the verb, the participle
               has been interpreted as ‘widespread’, in the sense of ‘in common use’, just like the
               Latin word <hi rend="italic">vulgata</hi>. The Syriac Bible based on the Hebrew was
               indeed in common use, in contrast to the versions made on the basis of the Greek
               Septuagint. Second, the usual sense of the participle, ‘simple’, could be interpreted
               as ‘single’ rather than as ‘abstaining from eloquent language’. This also assumes
               that the name was intended to contrast the version with the Syro-Hexapla, the word
                  <hi rend="italic">Hexapla</hi> meaning ‘six-fold’.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Origin and Dating of the OT Peshitta</label>
                    <p>Already in the 5th cent. one had to guess where the OT Peshitta came from. The
               Greek-speaking exegete <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> (d. 428) says
               that the Syriac Bible was composed by some unknown man who often made mistakes and
               even made up stories. Syriac authors in the following centuries mentioned various
               theories: it would have been commissioned by Hiram, king of Tyre and an ally of
               David; alternatively it would have been translated by a priest called Asya, who was
               sent to Samaria by the king of Assyria (cf. 2 Kings 17:27–8), by the Apostles, by
               Mark the Evangelist, or in the time of Abgar.</p>
                    <p>Modern scholars would agree with Theodore of Mopsuestia that the name of the
               translator (or translators) is unknown. Still, one can try to find out where, when,
               and in which community the Peshitta was translated. Over the past two centuries, some
               scholars have defended Jewish authorship, others Christian, whereas the famous
               linguist Theodor Nöldeke came up with the compromise that Jewish Christians were
               behind the work.</p>
                    <p>The most thorough and innovative discussion of the origin of the Peshitta is that of
               the late Michael Weitzman. In his <hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi> to this Syriac
               version, he first explains that the categories of ‘Judaism’ and ‘Christianity’ as
               they were used in the debate do not take account of the diversity within both
               religions which research of the last decades has revealed (see <ref rend="bold">Judaism, Syriac contacts with</ref>). It would be better, he argues, first to
               establish the ‘theological profile’ of the translation. Only then can we compare the
               version with what we know of the Jewish and Christian communities of the time.
               Weitzman’s own position is that the Peshitta was translated in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> from 150 onwards by a non-rabbinic Jewish group that clearly
               identified themselves with Judaism, but neglected some elements of ritual in favour
               of a more personal belief, in which prayer played an important role. They emphasized
               faith and hope rather than observance. As they shared these values with Christians,
               they might have adopted Christianity. This would then explain how a Jewish
               translation came to be transmitted by the Eastern Churches, and why it was not
               received among rabbinic Jews.</p>
                    <p>The evidence for the presence of Jews in Edessa may lead to a modification (Romeny
               2005). As far as we can tell on the basis of the funerary inscriptions found close to
               Edessa, it appears that Edessan Jews did use more or less the same dialect of
               Aramaic, but did not use the same script as the local pagans. They chose the square
               Jewish Aramaic script that was also used for Hebrew. On the other hand, Classical
               Syriac as we know it from the earliest Christian sources suggests that Edessan
               Christians adopted the Old Syriac dialect and script that were used by the pagans,
               rather than the Jewish script. This confronts us with the paradox of a translation
               that supposes a knowledge of Hebrew found only among very learned Jews but that was
               not written in the Jewish script. Was the Peshitta a gentile project, after all, or
               should we assume that, perhaps together with an update of the language, the
               translation was recast in Syriac script? The alternative is that the translators were
               Jewish Christians (in the sense of: Jews who had come to believe that Jesus Christ
               brought salvation) from the start.</p>
                    <p>It is certain that either some of the Jews of Edessa or one of its Christian groups
               felt the need for a version in the dialect of the town. What Weitzman calls the
               ‘theological profile’ of the translators is compatible with either possibility, as
               long as we do not think in terms of the ideal types of rabbinic Judaism and later
               Christianity. The use of the Syriac script, however, points solely in the direction
               of Christians. Whatever the case may be, it should be granted that the actual
               translation work was done by Jews, be they converted to Christianity before (Romeny)
               or after (Weitzman) the production of the Peshitta: we cannot assume that pagans who
               converted to Christianity commanded sufficient knowledge of Hebrew.</p>
                    <p>Weitzman connects the Peshitta with the city of Edessa. The Peshitta introduces
               references to Mabbug, <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>
               as additions to the text or substitutions for other names. These names suggest an
               origin in Osrhoene, the province around Edessa. The dialect and script of the
               Peshitta also accord well with that of the inscriptions found in this province.</p>
                    <p>Weitzman’s main argument for dating the OT Peshitta is formed by quotations of the
               Peshitta in other texts. On the basis of such quotations, a latest possible date can
               be established. If the Peshitta was indeed the basis for the OT quotations in the
                  <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref>, at least the books actually cited, that is, the
               Pentateuch, the Latter Prophets, and the Psalms, already existed and had attained
               some status by around 170. On the other hand, the fact that <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>, born in 154, quotes Gen. 9:6 in a form that stands closer to the
               Jewish Targum Onqelos could still indicate some reserve towards the Peshitta. This is
               a warning against adopting a much earlier date, and makes Weitzman propose the date
               of ca. 150. Chronicles, and perhaps also Ezra and Nehemiah, may have been translated
               about fifty years later.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Origin and Dating of the NT Peshitta</label>
                    <p>The history of the translation of the Greek NT into Syriac begins with <ref rend="bold">Tatian</ref>’s Diatessaron, a 2nd cent. Gospel harmony. The Old Syriac Version
               (3rd cent.) is the oldest translation of the four separate Gospels and the Peshitta
               (early 5th cent.) is a revision that brought the Old Syriac closer to the Greek.
               Burkitt (1904) attributed the Peshitta to <ref rend="bold">Rabbula</ref>, the bp. of
               Edessa (411–35) who had vigorously suppressed the use of the Diatessaron in the
               Syriac Church. While Rabbula may have enforced the dissemination of the Peshitta
               version, the theory that he was responsible for its creation was convincingly
               challenged by Vööbus (1951) who illustrated how Rabbula’s own writings contained
               quotations from the Old Syriac Version and the Diatessaron.</p>
                    <p>The Peshitta did not abruptly replace the Old Syriac. M. Black (1953) argued for the
               existence of an early Peshitta text, which he labelled ‘Pre-Peshitta’, that was
               closer to the Old Syriac than the later, definitive text of the Peshitta. ‘Genetic
               variants’ in the Syriac textual tradition, namely, readings that lie between the Old
               Syriac and the Peshitta, trace the gradual process of revision toward the Greek
               (Juckel 2009). Still, the Diatessaronic readings that appear in the Peshitta
               convinced Joosten (1996) that the Peshitta was based on a revised form of the
               Diatessaron. A precise description of the relationship between the Peshitta and the
               Old Syriac and Diatessaron will continue to elude scholars until a critical edition
               of the Peshitta Gospels is published.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Nature of the OT Translation</label>
                    <p>There has been an extensive debate among specialists of the OT Peshitta on the
               question of whether those text forms that are closer to the Hebrew text are
               representatives of an older stage of the Peshitta tradition or products of a
               revision. Studies on the books of Genesis and Exodus in the 5th cent. ms. 5b1 (Brit.
               Libr. Add. 14,425) eventually showed that a translation very close to the Hebrew
               model had developed into one that was easier to read and less ambiguous. Some phrases
               were replaced by more idiomatic Syriac ones or by expressions which better met the
               prevailing standards of literary Syriac. What is implicit in the Hebrew text and in
               the original translation was made explicit, for example, by adding the subject.
               Complicated sentences were clarified by slight additions or omissions, or by changes
               in word order. Finally, certain passages were harmonized in the process of
               transmission. All this happened during the first stages of the history of the
               Peshitta. For other books, it appears that we can discern a comparable first stage.
               The importance of ms. 9a1 (Florence, Bibl. Medicea Laurenziana, Or. 58) has been
               pointed out in this respect. Even though this is a much later ms., for some books it
               still preserves a text comparable to the Genesis and Exodus text of ms. 5b1.</p>
                    <p>The relative uniformity of mss. in later stages of the textual history, that is,
               after the 6th cent., suggests some kind of standardization: one text was chosen from
               a broader spectrum of texts which must have existed in the first stage. Koster’s
               research made it clear that after this second stage, represented by most mss. from
               the 6th until the 8th cent., further textual convergence can be observed. We can
               speak of a third stage, which he termed that of the <hi rend="italic">Textus
                  Receptus</hi> (others also speak of Standard Text). On the basis of <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>’s biblical quotations, we can say that the later
               Standard Text or <hi rend="italic">Textus Receptus</hi> was already available in the
               East at the end of the 8th cent. On the other hand, the biblical text of the
               commentary of the monk <ref rend="bold">Severos</ref> shows us that in the West,
               variation was still possible up to the end of the 9th cent., and that the western
               biblical ms. 9a1, which still represents the first stage of the development of the
               text, was not an isolated case.</p>
                    <p>Another issue that has been debated widely is the influence of other versions on the
               Peshitta. Some scholars have even suggested that the Peshitta was not a direct
               translation of the Hebrew, but based on an earlier Targum. It is, however, natural
               that two translations of the same text have something in common and could combine
               together against the source text because of the demands of the language or a
               similarity in interpretation  — all the more so if the two translations are written
               in dialects of the same language (see <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref>). There are no
               external data that prove contact between the Peshitta and the existing Targumim, and
               all parallels between the Targumim and the Peshitta can be explained as being the
               result of polygenesis or dependence on a common exegetical tradition. However, for
               the Septuagint, which is a translation into a completely different language, these
               explanations do not always suffice. In some books, notably Ezekiel and the Twelve
               Prophets, we have to assume some literary dependence of the Peshitta on the
               Septuagint. However, this dependence is not of a systematical nature, and may be the
               result of changes made in the later tradition.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Nature of the NT Translation</label>
                    <p>The NT Peshitta contains twenty-two books; it lacks 2–3  John, 2 Peter, Jude, and
               Revelation. It also omits John 7:53–8:11 (along with the Old Syriac and <ref rend="bold">Ḥarqlean</ref> versions) and a few isolated verses, such as Luke
               22:17–18. The history of the Syriac versions of the NT is characterized by
               gravitation toward the Greek text. Though, on occasion, the Peshitta preserves a
               Diatessaronic reading, where the Old Syriac reflects the Byzantine <hi rend="italic">Textus Receptus</hi> (both the Sinaiticus and Curetonian mss. show signs of
               revision toward the Greek text), in general the Peshitta is closer than the Old
               Syriac to the <hi rend="italic">Textus Receptus</hi>. It preserves readings that
               agree with the Western text type (Codex Bezae and the Old Latin), though many of its
               readings cannot be linked to any extant Greek witness. The readings unique to the
               Peshitta argue for its important role in NT textual criticism (Gwilliam 1903). The
               meticulous presentation of the Peshitta mss. for the Catholic and Pauline epistles by
               B. Aland and A. Juckel (1986–2002) reveals the homogeneity of these mss. The minor
               differences among them suggest that the Peshitta text of these epistles did not
               undergo a major revision during its transmission.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The Importance of the Peshitta</label>
                    <p>The reason why the International Organization for the Study of the Old Testament took
               the initiative to produce a new edition of the OT Peshitta (see below) is its
               relevance for the textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible. The edition and the studies
               based on it have made it clear that the Hebrew model of the Peshitta must have been
               nearly identical with the so-called Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible, the standard
               form of the text handed down to us by a tradition of Jewish scholars, the Masoretes.
               The Peshitta even reflects a vocalization of the Hebrew text that stands very close
               to the vocalization recorded many centuries later by the Masoretes. Thus, the Old
               Testament Peshitta is a prime witness to the strength and quality of the Jewish
               tradition since the 2nd cent. In the small number of instances where the Peshitta can
               be demonstrated to go back to a text that differs from the Masoretic Text, it can be
               useful to correct errors in the latter.</p>
                    <p>Another issue of scholarly interest is the language of the OT Peshitta. It is one of
               the largest and oldest texts written in Syriac. A number of studies into the syntax
               of the Peshitta have already appeared, and the Leiden Peshitta Institute is
               conducting major research projects in this field (Van Keulen and Van Peursen
               2006).</p>
                    <p>The NT Peshitta remains an important textual witness to the Greek NT since some of
               its readings are unique. NT textual critics must distinguish the readings that
               witness to Greek variants from those that witness to the Peshitta’s translation
               technique and/or exegesis (see, for example, Williams 2004). Continued research into
               the character of the NT Peshitta as a translation remains a <hi rend="italic">desideratum</hi>. In addition to its text critical value, the NT Peshitta
               witnesses to the reception and interpretation of the Greek NT by Syriac-speaking
               Christians in the 4th–5th cent.</p>
                    <p>The Peshitta is, however, not only of interest to scholars. In the first place, it is
               the Bible of the Syriac Churches, and it has been a source of spirituality to them
               for ages. It is used in sermons, commentaries, <ref rend="bold">poetry</ref>, and other
               genres of literature (see <ref rend="bold">Exegesis, OT</ref>and <ref rend="bold">Exegesis, NT</ref>). Its interpretations and exegetical traditions have colored
               the liturgy, and the prayers and hymns of the Syriac Churches follow the choice of
               words of the Peshitta. Many terms specific to the spirituality of the Syriac Churches
               have their origins in this ancient and reliable version of the OT and NT.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Text Editions</label>
                    <p>The first printed edition of part of the Syriac OT was the edition of the Psalms that
               was published in Quzḥayya, Lebanon, in 1610. It was followed in 1625 by two more
               editions of the Psalms: that of the Maronite Gabriel Sionita (<ref rend="bold">al-Ṣahyūnī, Jibrāʾīl</ref>), published in Paris, and that of Thomas van Erpe
               (Erpenius), a professor of Arabic, printed in Leiden, the Netherlands.</p>
                    <p>The first printed edition of the OT Peshitta as a whole is found in the Paris
               Polyglot. The Syriac text, edited by Gabriel Sionita, appeared in 1645. It was based
               on a rather poor ms.: 17a5 (Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 6). In its turn, the Paris
               Polyglot became the basis of the London Polyglot published by Brian Walton in 1657.
               This edition adds a number of variant readings from mss. present in English
               libraries, but otherwise just reproduces the Paris text. The text most widely
               available today goes back to that of Walton, and thus eventually to the Paris ms.
               17a5: in 1823 Samuel Lee published his edition of the Peshitta under the auspices of
               the British and Foreign Bible Society, adopting the text of the London Polyglot while
               making some use of the so-called Buchanan Bible (Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Oo. I.1,2 =
               12a1). The United Bible Societies have been publishing reprints of Lee’s edition up
               to this day.</p>
                    <p>Whereas Lee’s edition was printed in the W.-Syr. Serṭo script, the same century also
               saw two editions in E.-Syr. type: the so-called Urmia (1852) and Mosul (1887–92)
               Bibles. In parallel columns Urmia gives the text of the Peshitta based on Lee’s
               edition, corrected in some instances on the basis of mss. that were available
               locally, and a new translation of the Hebrew text into neo-Aramaic. It is assumed
               that the text of the Mosul edition, in its turn, made use of the Urmia edition. The
               Mosul edition was prepared by <ref rend="bold">Clemens Joseph David</ref>, Syr. Cath.
               Archbishop of Damascus, and George ʿAbdishoʿ Khayyāṭ, Chaldean Archbishop of
               Diyarbakır; it was published by the <ref rend="bold">Dominican</ref> Fathers. This
               edition also contains the text of the apocryphal or deutero-canonical books.</p>
                    <p>A 19th-cent. edition of a different nature was <ref rend="bold">A. M. Ceriani</ref>’s
               facsimile publication of ms. 7a1, the oldest codex containing the complete text of
               the OT Peshitta, from the Ambrosian Library in Milan (ms. B 21 inf.). It was
               published in the years 1876–83. This publication was a landmark in Peshitta studies.
               For the first time, a text became available to a scholarly public that differed
               markedly from that of the Paris Polyglot. The first scientific edition, containing
               only the Psalms, was published by W. E. Barnes in 1904. He used 7a1 as his base text,
               but corrected it on the basis of a number of other mss. With the help of C. W.
               Mitchell and J. Pinkerton, the same author also published a new edition of the
               Pentateuch in 1914. This edition gives a corrected version of Lee’s text.</p>
                    <p>It was not until 1959, however, that the International Organization for the Study of
               the Old Testament decided to start the Peshitta project, which was entrusted to the
               Leiden Peshitta Institute.In 1972 the first volume of the new edition appeared, under
               the title <hi rend="italic">The Old Testament in Syriac according to the Peshitta
                  Version</hi>. The Leiden edition does not offer a critical text (one that tries to
               come as close to the original as possible). It prints a basic text, usually 7a1, with
               a number of emendations. Readings deemed impossible and readings not supported by two
               or more mss. dated before the year 1000 are emended. The <hi rend="italic">critical
                  apparatus</hi>, the list of variant readings, only includes mss. older than the
               13th cent. The reason for this unorthodox approach, which resulted in a mixed text,
               was economy. The main text was meant as a point of reference: it should be common
               enough to guarantee a concise apparatus. This entails that the main text as such has
               no status. As De Boer writes: ‘The text printed in this edition — it must be stated
                  <hi rend="italic">expressis verbis</hi> — ought to be used in exegetical and
               textual study together with the apparatuses’ (De Boer, Preface to the Genesis-Exodus
               volume, p. viii). In other words, the reader cannot just quote the text; he or she
               should first go over the apparatus and do the work of the textual critic.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the shortcomings that are the result of its edition method, there is
               no doubt that the Leiden Peshitta edition is the most important tool for the study of
               the Peshitta of the OT. The edition will consist of 17 volumes, 13 of which have now
               appeared. The Peshitta Institute intends to publish additional volumes with the
               variants of biblical mss. up to and including the 15th cent. as well as studies of
               the text of the Syriac fathers, whose witness is considered very important. The main
               text of the edition is also available in electronic format through the website of the
               Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon (http://cal1.cn.huc.edu/).</p>
                    <p>The first printed edition of the Syriac NT was prepared by Johann Widmanstetter in
               1555. A year later Immanuel Tremellius produced another edition. A critical edition
               of the Gospels (citing forty-two mss. from the 5th–12th cent.) was prepared by
               P. E.  Pusey and G. H.  Gwilliam (1901). Pusey and Gwilliam’s provisional text for
               the rest of the NT was combined with their edition of the Gospels to produce <hi rend="italic">The New Testament in Syriac</hi> (The British and Foreign Bible
               Society, 1905–20). The minor Catholic letters (2 Peter, 2–3 John, and Jude) and the
               Book of Revelation in this edition are taken from J. Gwynn (1897 and 1909); these are
               remnants of the Philoxenian version (see <ref rend="bold">Polykarpos</ref>). More
               recently, G.  Kiraz produced a comparative edition of the Syriac Gospels (Kiraz 1996)
               that aligns the Siniaticus and Curetonian mss. with the Peshitta and Ḥarqlean
               versions. A new critical edition of the Peshitta Gospels is needed, though the
               quantity of Peshitta mss. renders this a formidable task. The Institut für
               Neutestamentliche Text- forschung at Münster has produced an edition of the Catholic
               and Pauline letters (B. Aland and A. Juckel 1986–2002) that aligns Peshitta mss. with
               the Ḥarqlean text and quotations from Syriac authors.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Translation into English</label>
                    <p>The Peshitta has been translated into English by <ref rend="bold">George M.
               Lamsa</ref>. Unfortunately, this translation has been assimilated to the Hebrew text
               in quite a few places, and is not based on a reliable text of the Peshitta. The
               latter point also applies to Andrew Oliver’s lesser known translation of the Peshitta
               Psalter. A new English annotated translation of the OT Peshitta is now being prepared
               by a group of scholars as one of the Leiden Peshitta Institute’s projects. It will
               appear under the title <hi rend="italic">The Bible of Edessa</hi>. Portions of the NT
               have been translated into English by J. W. Etheridge (1846 and 1849) and by James
               Murdock (1851).</p>

               ascetic life, he managed to escape, to become a monk in Palestine, eventually
               settling in a monastery near Gaza where he was a leading figure among opponents of

               refuge in Egypt (455), only returning to Palestine twenty years later. Detailed
               biographies of him survive in Syriac (ed. with ET C. Horn and R. Phenix, 2008) and in

                    <p>Syr. Orth. Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, theologian, and liturgist, date of
               birth unknown but said to be a ‘young man’ (= under 40) at the time of his
               consecration in 580/1 and hence born ca. 550(?), d. 22 April 591. A native of
               Kallinikos (Latin <hi rend="italic">Callinicum</hi>; Arabic <hi rend="italic">al-Raqqa</hi>ʿ) he had probably been a monk (plausibly at the nearby monastery of
               Mar Ḥanino where he was consecrated) before election to a see troubled by problems of
               succession and with more than one claimant to canonical occupancy of the throne.
               Twice he refused the office even though pressed by <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub
                  Burdʿoyo</ref> but yielded, probably unwillingly, to pressure. Certainly his first
               official act was to visit his fellow-Syrian and co-religionist Damian, Pope of
               Alexandria (577/8–606/7) avowedly to offer his resignation if that would unite the
               quarrelling parties; for Damian, a vigorous and effective reformer, was the
               acknowledged leader in the partnership of Syrian and Egyptian Churches. The offer, if
               made, was refused and the death of one of the claimants resolved a difficulty. The
               visit to Alexandria unintentionally occasioned the conversion to the ‘synodite’, i.e.
               Chalcedonian cause of two accompanying expert theologians, <ref rend="bold">Proba</ref>
               and <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon Barbur</ref>, who were to be duly condemned by a synod
               (584/585) at Peter’s probable residence (he was banned from entry into Antioch) of
               the monastery of Gubba Barraya. Peter wrote against them, but the work has not
               survived. Relations between Pope and Patriarch, at the outset warm apparently, became
               strained following the publication by Damian in ca. 585 of a defence of the unity of
               God in Trinity against the teaching of <ref rend="bold">John Philoponus</ref> and
               others; they finally broke down and a schism between the Churches of Syria and Egypt
               was mended only in 616 after the death of both disputants. Peter’s extant literary
               legacy consists of: 1. an Anaphora in Syriac (ed. R. Y.  Ebied and L. R.  Wickham, in
                  <hi rend="italic">Harp</hi>23 [2008], 309–43); 2. A <hi rend="italic">mimro</hi>
               ‘On the Crucifixion’; 3. parts of seven Letters (see R. Y. Ebied, A. Van Roey and L.
               R. Wickham, in <hi rend="italic">OLA</hi> 10 [1981]); and 4. works in connexion with
               the tritheist controversy: a. Rebuttal of those charged with Sabellianism (= Pope
               Damian and the ‘Damianites’) and who therefore spread the libellous report about us
               of holding the heathen dogmas of the Tritheists; b. a treatise originally in three
               books of which the second survives in part and the third complete; unnamed in the
               mss. it has been given the title Against Damian by its recent editors. Quite probably
               (a) is in fact the remains of the lost first book of the treatise. The genuineness of
               3 and 4 (all in early and excellent Syriac translation from the Greek) is guaranteed
               by the general witness of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>; there is no reason to
               doubt Peter’s direct authorship of 2 and at least indirect of 1. The big treatise was
               valued for its extensive quotations from the Greek Fathers, extant florilegia being
               compiled from it and attesting the continuity and vigour of the Greek/W.-Syr.
               theological heritage.</p>

                    <p>Metropolitan bp. of Mabbug (modern Membij/ancient Hierapolis) (485–519), ascetic
               theologian, christological polemicist, and sponsor of the Philoxenian NT. Born in
                  <ref rend="bold">Beth Garmai</ref> before 450, Philoxenos was educated in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> and likely ordained in <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> under
               Patr. Peter the Fuller (ca. 470s). With Peter, Philoxenos joined the controversies
               over the anti-Chalcedonian addition to the Trisagion. Exiled from Antioch under Patr.
               Calendio (482–484), Philoxenos sojourned among the monasteries of Syria. Supporting
               the Henotikon, Philoxenos visited Constantinople in 484 to offer Zeno a Miaphysite
               profession of faith. Upon Peter’s restoration in 485, Philoxenos was named
               metropolitan of Mabbug. Philoxenos soon established a reputation as a theologian of
               asceticism (following <ref rend="bold">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>) and christology
               (following <ref rend="bold">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>). Writing primarily for monastic
               audiences, Philoxenos considered the fight against christological error to be a step
               in the ascetic pursuit of divine knowledge.</p>
                    <p>By the 490s, Philoxenos emerged as the senior leader of the anti-Chalcedonians in
               Syria and Mesopotamia, particularly after 498 when the pro-Chalcedonian Flavian was
               named Patr. of Antioch. Philoxenos had little success converting Mabbug to Miaphysite
               christology. Nevertheless, he used his thirty-year tenure to bolster Miaphysite
               theology throughout the Roman East and beyond (supporting missionaries in Persia and
                  <ref rend="bold">Nagran</ref>).</p>
                    <p>Philoxenos’s theology was very much centered on the Greek milieu of Antioch and
               Constantinople. Philoxenos came to mistrust traditional Syriac vocabulary as
               insufficient for expressing the nuances of Greek christological thought. He sought to
               bring Syriac theology closer to Greek terminology and established Mabbug as a center
               for translation. He sponsored a new translation of the NT into Syriac by the
               auxiliary bp. <ref rend="bold">Polykarpos</ref>. Philoxenos himself wrote polemical
               commentaries on portions of Matthew, Luke, and John. No copies of the Philoxenian
               version are extant (having been superseded by the later <ref rend="bold">Ḥarqlean</ref>
               translation), but firsthand evidence of the scriptorium survives in three mss.
               produced in Philoxenos’s own lifetime: London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,528; 14,534; and
               17,126.</p>
                    <p>Philoxenos’s anti-Chalcedon efforts culminated in 512 when Flavian was ousted in
               favor of <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref> as Patr. of Antioch. Philoxenos and his
               suffragan bishops (including a relation, Philoxenos of Doliche) assisted at Severus’s
               consecration. Although later opponents vilified Philoxenos and Severus as
               uncompromising, epistolary evidence reveals that they initially struck a conciliatory
               tone as they sought to consolidate Miaphysite control of the clergy in Syria and
               Anatolia.</p>
                    <p>In 519, Justin I exiled Philoxenos. In his final years, Philoxenos continued writing
               to monastic communities, encouraging them to persist in ascesis and Miaphysite
               christology. Philoxenos died in 523 under house arrest. Later traditions that he was
               executed are difficult to substantiate.</p>
                    <p>Philoxenos’s reputation grew after his death. Several 6th- and 7th-cent. mss. survive
               citing his works alongside Cyril and Severus. Philoxenos’s cult was strong in <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> where his relics were translated to a church dedicated
               to him in <ref rend="bold">Midyat</ref> and to the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Mor
                  Gabriel</ref>. In the 13th cent. <ref rend="bold">Eli of Qarṭmin</ref> composed a
               valuable life of Philoxenos.</p>
                    <p>Although Philoxenos’s ascetic Discourses circulated widely in their entirety, the
               majority of his corpus was preserved only in the catena of polemical handbooks,
               stripping his christological polemics of their ascetic context. Considering his
               entire corpus, Philoxenos was no mere polemicist. He played the many roles of late
               antique bp., monastic leader, prolific theologian, biblical commentator, and would-be
               imperial counsellor.</p>
                    <p>Liturgical commemorations for Philoxenos are attested for 10 Dec., 18 Feb., 1 and 2
               April, and 16 and 18 Aug.</p>

                    <p>A collection of short texts, originally written in Greek, concerning natural history
               (mainly animals). The work, perhaps composed in Egypt in the late 2nd or 3rd cent.,
               proved immensely popular and was translated into many different languages, including
               Syriac, Coptic, Armenian, Georgian, Arabic, Latin, Slavonic, Romanian, and various
               other European languages. The earliest form of the Greek text had 48 short chapters
               (edited by Sbordone 1936, and D. Offermanns 1966). Later forms of the text usually
               contain moralizing conclusions to each chapter. There are English translations of the
               Greek by F. J. Carmody (1953) and R. M. Grant, in his <hi rend="italic">Early
                  Christians and Animals</hi> (1999), 52–72.</p>
                    <p>The Syriac translation survives in several different forms: 1. an early form,
               containing 32 chapters (edited by O. G. Tychsen 1795); 2. an expanded edition, with
               81 chapters, of which only the first 47 really belong to the Physiologus (edited by
               J. P. N. Land 1875); 3. a much longer text, entitled ‘The Book of Natural Beings’,
               with 125 chapters, of which only 45 are derived from the Physiologus (edited by K.
               Ahrens 1892); 4. a fragmentary form, preserving only 9 chapters (edited by A. van
               Lantschoot, in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>72 [1959]).</p>

                    <p>The basic organizing principle of Syriac poetry is syllable (<hi rend="italic">hegyānā</hi>) count. Although it has sometimes been claimed that stress patterns
               also played a role, this has never been satisfactorily substantiated. Rhyme is
               occasionally found in early poetry, but it is only used for special effect. The
               regular use of rhyme becomes a common feature from about the 9th cent. onwards, due
               to the influence of Arabic poetry. Acrostics, both alphabetic and spelling out the
               author’s name, are already found in <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>’s poetry.</p>
                    <p>There are two main forms of poetry: 1. The <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi>, or narrative
               poem, employing couplets all in the same syllabic meter; the most common meters are
               those associated with <ref rend="bold">Balai</ref> (5 syllable couplets), Ephrem (7
               syllable couplets) and <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref> (12 syllable couplets,
               with each line consisting of 4+4+4 syllables). Other meters, such as 6+6 and 8+8 are
               less frequently found. Although the term <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> has been
               conventionally translated by Latin <hi rend="italic">carmen</hi> ‘song’, <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> were probably recited rather than sung; 2. The stanzaic
               poem, or <hi rend="italic">madrāšā</hi> (often translated ‘hymn’); here each stanza
                  (<hi rend="italic">baytā</hi>) follows the same syllabic pattern (<hi rend="italic">mšuḥtā</hi>). These patterns may either be simple, built up of units
               of the same number of syllables (e.g. stanzas of 5+5+5+5+5 syllables), or complex
               (e.g. 5+6 7+4 4+4 4+5). Ephrem already employs some 50 syllabic patterns, or <hi rend="italic">qāle</hi>, and many more subsequently came into use; in this context
               the term <hi rend="italic">qālā</hi> properly denotes the melody to which the <hi rend="italic">madrāšā</hi> was to be sung, but the <hi rend="italic">qālā</hi>
               title also serves as an indicator of the meter and would usually be taken from the
               opening words of a particular <hi rend="italic">madrāšā</hi>; thus, for example, the
                  <hi rend="italic">qālā</hi> title for Ephrem’s Nisibene <hi rend="italic">madrāšā</hi> no. 50 is given as <hi rend="italic">a(n)t mār(y) aktebtāh</hi>,
               which are the opening words of no. 10 of his <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi> on Faith.
               According to some scholars the <hi rend="italic">madrāšā</hi> was not originally
               sung, and it was <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref> who introduced that aspect (see McVey
               1999).</p>
                    <p>Later on, terms for certain sub-categories of the <hi rend="italic">madrāšā</hi> were
               introduced, notably <hi rend="italic">qālā</hi> and <hi rend="italic">soghithā</hi>.
               In the liturgical books <hi rend="italic">qālā</hi> became a generic term for
               stanzaic verse. The Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Yeshuʿ the Stylite</ref> (chap. 54),
               composed in Yaʿqub of Serugh’s own lifetime, speaks of Yaʿqub as having composed <hi rend="italic">soghyāthā</hi> (and <hi rend="italic">zmirāthā</hi>) as well as <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, and indeed a few of these survive, alongside his much
               more familiar <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>. In due course the term <hi rend="italic">soghithā</hi> came to designate four-line poems with a simple meter, usually 7+7
               7+7 (or, in Maron. tradition, 8+8), with or without an alphabetic acrostic. A
               sub-category of the <hi rend="italic">soghithā</hi> was the dialogue, or dispute,
               poem (normally with an alphabetic acrostic), where two protagonists speak in
               alternating verses. This particular literary genre, taken up in many different
               languages of the Middle East, can be traced back to the precedence disputes of
               Ancient Mesopotamia, and it has remained popular right up to the present day (some
               examples in Neo-Aramaic<ref rend="bold"/>dialects are known).</p>
                    <p>Two Greek poetic repertoires were taken over (as prose translations) into the Syr.
               Orth. tradition, the <hi rend="italic">maʿnyotho</hi> of <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref>
               and others (often misleadingly entitled the Octoechos), and the <hi rend="italic">qonune</hi>, or ‘canons’. It was under the influence of Melkite translations of
               Greek ‘canons’ by <ref rend="bold">John of Damascus</ref>, Cosmas of Jerusalem, and
               others, that this particular new genre was adopted in the more westerly dioceses of
               the Syr. Orth. tradition: <hi rend="italic">qonune yawnoye</hi> ‘Greek canons’,
               largely translated from Greek, took as their starting point the Canticles (or Odes),
               while the <hi rend="italic">qonune suryoye</hi>, ‘Syriac canons’, were Syriac
               compositions, based on Ps. 51 (and other psalms).</p>
                    <p>From about the 9th cent. Syriac began to adopt various features characteristic of
               Arabic poetry; most notable among these were various forms of rhyme (initial and
               internal, as well as end rhyme). The influence of Arabic can also be seen in many of
               the poems that make up <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>’s ‘Paradise of
               Eden’, where all sorts of artifices, such as lipograms, can be found; that these have
               continued to be appreciated is indicated by the considerable number of mss. (and
               several printed editions) of this work. At least one later writer composed picture
               poems: thus in 1616 Gabriel, metropolitan of Ḥesno d-Kifo, provided such a poem in
               honour of Pope Paul V (illustrated in S. Giamil, <hi rend="italic">Genuinae
                  relationes inter sedem apostolicam et Assyriorum orientalium seu Chaldaeorum
                  ecclesiam</hi> [1902], 159).</p>
                    <p>An early classification of the <hi rend="italic">qāle</hi> used by Ephrem is found in
               a 7th-cent. ms. on Sinai (ed. A. de Halleux, in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>85 [1972],
               171–99). The first Syriac writer, however, to write a treatise on poetry was <ref rend="bold">Anṭun of Tagrit</ref> (9th cent.); this forms Book 5 (ed. J. W. Watt) of
               his larger work on ‘Rhetoric’. <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref> also devotes a
               section to the subject in his ‘Book of Dialogues’ (ed. J. P. P. Martin, with FT). In
               about the 12th/13th cent. the liturgical book known as the <hi rend="italic">Beth
                  Gazo</hi> emerged, classifying the melodies used and arranging them according to
               the eight tones (a system that enters the Syr. Orth. liturgical tradition from about
               the 9th century, according to Cody); somewhat analogous to the Greek Heirmologion,
               the <hi rend="italic">Beth Gazo</hi> provides the model stanzas that accompanied each
                  <hi rend="italic">qālā</hi>. A number of printed editions of these have been
               published, both in India (Pampakuda, undated, 1986, 1997) and in Europe, going back
               to an edition (1913) by Dolabani (Glane/Losser, 1981, 1985); and in a much fuller
               form, 1992, based primarily on a ms. of 1554; editions provided with western musical
               notation have been prepared by Nuri Iskander (Aleppo, 1996 and 2003); the former of
               these two volumes represents the <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> tradition (and includes
               an Introduction on Syriac music by Mor Grigorios Yūḥannā Ibrāhīm), while the latter
               represents that of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>. (The musical aspects of the <hi rend="italic">Beth Gazo</hi> were the subject of a number of studies by J.
               Jeannin, H. Hussmann, and others). Many of the texts in an early Maronite <hi rend="italic">Beth Gazo</hi> (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,703, of the 12th/13th cent.)
               have been edited by J. Tabet (Kaslik, 2001–4). (The E.-Syr. liturgical volume
               entitled Gazza is a hymnary of a different character).</p>
                    <p>In the 17th cent. the great Maron. Patr. and scholar, <ref rend="bold">Isṭifān
                  al-Duwayhī</ref>, set out to classify the model strophes according to their
               syllabic meters; this has now been edited and translated by L.  Hage (1987). In
               recent times the learned metropolitan of Mardin, Mar <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos
                  Yuḥanon Dolabani</ref> (d. 1969) wrote a short handbook on Syriac poetic form,
               published the year after his death (Aleppo, 1970); as he indicates in his preface,
               this is based on Anṭun and <ref rend="bold">G. Cardahi</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Liber
                  thesauri de arte poetica syrorum</hi> (1875; an anthology of late poets, with
               Arabic introduction).</p>
                    <p>Since verse has always frequently been a medium of instruction, it can be found used
               also for subjects that might surprise Western readers, such as exegesis, astronomy,
               chronology, and grammar.</p>
                    <p>A list of the main Syriac poets in the Syr. Orth. tradition is given by <ref rend="bold">Barsoum</ref>, <hi rend="italic">Scattered pearls,</hi>35–8, where he
               provides four separate categories, according to their quality. His first category
               includes Ephrem, <ref rend="bold">Qurillona</ref>, the various persons named <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq, Shemʿun Quqoyo</ref>, Yaʿqub of Serugh, <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of
                  Edessa</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>, Bar Sobto, Bar
               Qiqi, Bar Sabouni, Timotheos of Gargar, Bar Andrawos, <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon bar
                  Maʿdani</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>. To these one might add, from
               the E.-Syr. tradition, <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Eliya of
                  al-Anbār</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Emmanuel bar Shahhare</ref>, ʿAbdishoʿ of Soba,
                  <ref rend="bold">Gewargis Warda</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Khamis bar Qardaḥe</ref>.
               A large amount of poetry continues to be produced in Classical Syriac right up to the
               present day. Finally, it should not be forgotten that a great deal of anonymous
               poetry, for the most part transmitted in liturgical mss., is of very high
               quality.</p>

                    <p>Chorepiscopus of the diocese of Mabbug, who was commissioned with the translation of
               the NT (and parts of the OT) by <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> (the
               so-called Philoxenian version). The only information about Polykarpos derives from
               his contemporary <ref rend="bold">Mushe of Aggel</ref>. In the introductory letter to
               Paphnutius, prefixed to his own Syriac translation of <ref rend="bold">Cyril</ref>’s
               explanation of the Pentateuch (‘Glaphyra’), Mushe refers to the ‘edition of the NT
               and of David (i.e. Psalms) that the deceased Chorepiscopus made for Philoxenos of
               Mabbug in Syriac’ (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, vol. 2, 82–3; Guidi, 404,
               410–12). This piece of information is unsuspicious, as later references to this
               version link it directly with Philoxenos without mentioning Polykarpos (<ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, Ecclesiastical History, ed. Abbeloos and Lamy, I, 50
               = vol. 1, col. 267; II, 22 = vol. 3, col. 89; proemto the <hi rend="italic">Awṣar
                  Roze</hi>; <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, Chronicle, X, 25 = vol. 4, 391).
               Scholars also prefer the commissioner’s prominent name (‘Philoxenian’) to that of the
               otherwise unknown translator. The instigation and intention of the version actually
               derive from Philoxenos. It was designed for serving the miaphysite cause by providing
               a Syriac NT version, sufficiently close to the Greek, in order to defend miaphysite
               Christology and doctrine. In his ‘Commentary on the Prologue of John’ (ed. A. de
               Halleux, CSCO 380, 1977) Philoxenos points to several imprecise translations in
                  the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>, which was to be replaced by an entirely new
               translation.</p>
                    <p>While Bar ʿEbroyo and Michael provide an approximate date for Polykarpos’s version by
               linking it with Philoxenos, the subscriptions of the <ref rend="bold">Ḥarqlean
                  Version</ref> (615/16) give the exact date ‘819 of Alexander of Macedonia’ (= AD
               507/08). These subscriptions provide additional information: first, that the Greek
               model was associated with Caesarea in Palestine and with the famous library directed
               by Pamphilus; second, that this version for the first time included the Minor
               Catholic Epistles and Revelation, neither of which was part of the Peshitta
               canon.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately no ms. of the original version survives. Our knowledge of the version’s
               text derives from four sources: 1. from quotations in the later writings of
               Philoxenos (collected in part by B. Aland); 2. from quotations in the margins of the
                  <ref rend="bold">Masora</ref> mss. (ed. N. Wiseman 1828); 3. from quotations
               preserved in the Euthalian prologue to the Pauline epistles (ed. S. Brock 1979); and
               4. from a 6th-cent. translation of the Minor Catholic Epistles and Revelation (ed. J.
               Gwynn 1909, 1897), extant almost exclusively in mss. of the second millennium (an
               Arabic translation of the epistles exists in ms. Sin. Arab. 154, ed. M. Dunlop Gibson
               1899). This translation can only be identified with Polykarpos’s version by internal
               evidence (Gwynn 1909, introduction). All these remnants reveal the version’s
               intermediary position between the Peshitta and the Ḥarqlean regarding the refinement
               of translation technique; it is closer to the Greek than the Peshitta, but is not a
               ‘mirror translation’ of the Greek like the Ḥarqlean (in general, see <ref rend="bold">Greek, Syriac translations from</ref>).</p>
                    <p>Polykarpos’s version received a thorough revisional update, which resulted in the
               Ḥarqlean Version (615/16). This might be the reason for the almost complete
               disappearance of Polykarpos’s version, which was outdated by the new. Fortunately
               essential information on Polykarpos’s version was included and thus preserved in the
               Ḥarqlean subscriptions. Nevertheless, the revisional relationship between
               Polykarpos’s original version and the update prepared by <ref rend="bold">Tumo of
                  Ḥarqel</ref> remained unclear so long as genuine Philoxenian texts for comparison
               were not available. The ‘Philoxenian-Ḥarqlean problem’ centered around the question
               of whether Tumo simply re-issued Polykarpos’s version adding material to the text and
               margins or whether he produced a new independent version. This problem derives not
               only from the ambiguity of the Ḥarqlean subscriptions, but also from the ‘Mohl ms.’
               (now Cambridge, Univ. Libr. Add. 1700; without Ḥarqlean annotations). The heading
                  (<hi rend="italic">inscriptio</hi>) to Acts in this ms. reads: ‘The Acts of the
               Twelve Holy Apostles according to the tradition of the holy Mor Aksnoyo (<hi rend="italic">ayk mašlmonutho d-qaddišo Mor Aksnoyo</hi> [i.e. Philoxenos])’.
               However, the subscriptions prove that the ms. is surely Ḥarqlean. The view that the
               Ḥarqlean is a new (though not totally independent) version turned out to be
               substantially correct. In addition to the attached textual material, Tumo introduced
               a refinement of translation technique that turned Polykarpos’s original version into
               a ‘mirror translation’. Polykarpos’s version was an attractive starting point for
               Tumo’s own version due to its already close adherence to the Greek and the connection
               of its underlying Greek text with Pamphilus’s famous library in Caesarea. It was this
               underlying Greek text that Tumo wished to preserve and to mirror in his own version,
               and he was not interested in preserving Polykarpos’s version for its own sake.</p>
                    <p>The ‘Philoxenian-Ḥarqlean problem’ arose with the <hi rend="italic">editio
                  princeps</hi> of the Ḥarqlean in 1778–1803, which the editor J. White considered
               to be the annotated re-issue of Polykarpos’s version and so entitled it <hi rend="italic">Sacrorum Evangeliorum versio syriaca philoxeniana</hi>. Those who
               argued for an independent new version tried to identify mss. of Polykarpos’s original
               version. J. G. Ch. Adler claimed that ms. Florence, Bibl. Laurenziana Plut. I,40 was
               the earlier version; G. Bernstein favored ms. Rome, Bibl. Angelica 74. The choice of
               these scholars was directed by the absence of annotations from these codices. They
               are, however, nothing other than Ḥarqlean mss. that lost their annotations in the
               course of transmission (a common feature of Ḥarqlean mss.).</p>
                    <p>There is reason to assume that Polykarpos also translated some of the OT since Mushe
               of Aggel mentions the Psalms alongside the NT (see above). Moreover, a quotation of
               Is. 9:6 in the Milan <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref> is attributed to the version,
               ‘which was translated through the care of the holy Philoxenos’. Ceriani edited and
               identified as possibly ‘Philoxenian’ a fragmentary version of Isaiah (preserved in
               ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 17,106), which is translated from Greek, but agrees with neither
               the Syro-Hexapla nor the version of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>. The
               extensive study of R. G. Jenkins supplies evidence for at least Gen., Ex., and Isa.
               (not for Ps.!) that ‘Philoxenos came under the influence of a Greek form of certain
               Old Testament books’. As this influence can only be traced in writings from the later
               period of Philoxenos’s life (corresponding to his use of Polykarpos’s NT version), it
               is very likely that Polykarpos also produced a translation of individual OT
               books.</p>

                    <p>Syriac printed from wood-cuts can be found in European books as early as 1486, but
               the first text to be printed from type was in <ref rend="bold">T. Ambrogio</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Introductio in linguam chaldaicam</hi> (Pavia, 1539). Later in the
               century and on into the 18th cent., presses in Rome (the Tipografia Medicea, 1592;
               Maronite College, 1617; and Propaganda Fide, 1627), took the lead in the production
               of Syriac books, chiefly service-books but also grammatical and other scholarly
               works. All these presses used well-cut Serṭo types based on Maronite handwriting. A
               type in the same style cut for F. Savary de Brèves was first used in Paris for a
               Psalter in 1624; and another for the polyglot Bible of M. Le Jay (starting with vol.
               5, 1630). Elsewhere in Europe, Syriac printing began with J. Widmanstetter’s New
               Testament printed in Vienna in 1555. Other biblical and scholarly printing followed,
               especially in the Netherlands (C. Plantin, 1569; T. Erpenius, 1619; Elsevier, 1630)
               and eventually in Britain (1639). The Serṭo types in these books were generally
               independent of the Maron. models, and inferior.</p>
                    <p>In the Middle East, a Syriac Psalter was printed at the Maron. monastery of Quzḥayya,
               Lebanon, as early as 1610, but nothing followed there until the printing of service
               books began again after 1782. East of Lebanon, Syriac printing started with the
               American ‘Nestorian Mission’ in <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref>, Persia. The missionaries
               reduced the local dialect to writing (using the E.-Syr. script), and began to print
               in it in 1841. They used at first the type made by W. Watts for an E.-Syr. edition of
               the New Testament (London, 1829), then new types made by the mission printer Edward
               Breath. The output of this press was chiefly Protestant religious literature, but it
               also included a long-running newspaper <hi rend="italic">Zahrire d-bahrā</hi> ‘Rays
               of Light’ (1849–1918). Among other mission and church presses in the Middle East in
               the 19th–20th cent., the most important printers of Syriac were the Imprimerie des
               Pères Dominicains in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> (ca. 1857) and the Jesuit Imprimerie
               Catholique in <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref> (ca. 1877).</p>
                    <p>In India, Syriac has been printed by various church-owned presses since the 19th
               cent. The most important are St. Joseph’s Press, Mannanam (1866), St. Thomas Press,
               Cochin (1870), Mar Julius Press, Pampakuda (1870), and Mar Narsai Press, Trichur
               (1926). Most of the types used in their books are of Indian manufacture.</p>
                    <p>A Linotype version of E.-Syr. was first made in 1915, for Joel E. Werda’s newspaper
                  <hi rend="italic">Izgadda</hi> (New York, later Connecticut, 1915–25). Hand and
               Linotype composition produced a good deal of secular <ref rend="bold">Assyrian</ref>
               journalism and other literature between the wars in the USA and in Iran and Iraq.</p>
                    <p>Printing of scholarly Syriac was stimulated in the mid 19th cent. by the acquisition
               of old mss. by the British Museum. The years 1848–1914 saw a boom in publications,
               many in the Esṭrangela script and printed to a high standard of typography and
               presswork, notably by Oxford and Cambridge University presses, the Imprimerie
               Nationale (Paris) and W. Drugulin (Leipzig). For the Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum
               Orientalium (printed by the firm of Peeters in Louvain), the British Monotype
               Corporation produced an Esṭrangela type in 1954 designed by R. Draguet that allowed
               machine composition of this script for the first time. A film version for the
               Monophoto typesetter followed in 1977.</p>
                    <p>Since the mid 1980s, digital technology has democratized the printing of Syriac at
               all levels: ecclesiastical, academic, and vernacular. Syriac text may now be composed
               on a personal computer, using ordinary word-processing software and fonts available
               for all the Syriac scripts, and sent electronically in pdf format to a commercial
               printer for lithographic reproduction.</p>

                    <p>Syriac commentator on <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>’s writings on logic. The
               juxtaposition of Proba with <ref rend="bold">Hiba</ref> and Komi in the ‘Catalogue’ of
                  <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> has led to the view that he was associated with the
                  <ref rend="bold">School of Edessa</ref> and belonged to the first half of the 5th
               cent. On internal evidence, however, this is impossible, since he is clearly writing
               at a later date than the Neoplatonist Proclus (died 485), whom he even mentions by
               name (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,660, f. 23rv); on the other hand, a date close to that
               of <ref rend="bold">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref> (thus Suermann) is likely to
               be too late, and a 6th-cent. date seems most likely. In two mss. (Berlin, Sachau 226,
               and Mingana Syr. 606) he is described as ‘priest, archdeacon and <hi rend="italic">archiatros</hi> (chief doctor) of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>’.</p>
                    <p>Three works by Proba are extant:</p>
                    <p>1. A commentary on <ref rend="bold">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Introduction’ (to Aristotle’s
               logical works). Of this an extract was published by Baumstark (4*–12* [Syr.], 148–56
               [GT]), corresponding to f. 23r–28v in a longer (but acephalous) text in Mingana Syr.
               606, f. 1–28v. There are also fragments of a 9th-cent. ms. preserved in Brit. Libr.
               Add. 17,215, f. 7–8 and Dayr al-Suryān Syr. Fragment 88. According to Suermann (1994)
               this work, unlike the others, can be dated to a time between Hiba and <ref rend="bold">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref>, but this is very problematic.</p>
                    <p>2. A commentary on Aristotle’s ‘On Interpretation’, ed. Hoffmann, 62–89; an earlier
               ms., Brit. Libr. Add. 14,660, f. 1–46 (9th/10th cent.) contains a much longer but
               acephalous text (f. 1r–6r corresponds to Hoffmann 79–89). According to Mingana Syr.
               606, f. 140v, the Syriac translation of the ‘On Interpretation’ (ed. Hoffmann, 23–55)
               was by Proba, as well, but in the other mss. it is anonymous.</p>

                    <p>Possibly also by him is a proposal ‘by Proba the philosopher’ for an improved

               153; excerpt in Sachau, <hi rend="italic">Verzeichnis</hi>, 33–4).</p>
                    <p>It is just possible that this Proba is the same person as the <ref rend="bold">Proba</ref> who accompanied Patr. <ref rend="bold">Peter of Kallinikos</ref> to

                    <p>Bp. of Cyzicus and since 434 Patr. of Constantinople. His literary work, all in
               Greek, consists of homilies and letters. His homilies enjoyed great popularity and
               were translated into several languages. While Leroy’s 1967 study surveyed 34
               homilies, the authors of <hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> list 37 homilies, without
               counting those of dubious authenticity (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 5800–5836). A
               number of these have found their way into the Syr. homiliaries, in particular of the
               Syr. Orth. tradition. Three homilies were published by Chabot: Hom. 23 (‘On the dogma
               of the incarnation’); Hom. 24 (‘On the Nativity’, edited in a different version by
               Moss); and Hom. 25 (‘On St. Clement bp. of Ancyra’). Hom. 1 (‘On the Mother of God’,
               delivered in Constantinople in 428 or 429, in the presence of Nestorius) was edited
               by Lucchesi. Both Lebon and Brière edited Hom. 5 (‘On the Virgin and Mother of God’),
               which in the Syr. version is expanded with a homily by Atticus of Constantinople.
               Hom. 17 (‘On St. Stephen the first martyr’) is in the Syriac version attributed to
                  <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref>; it was edited by Malki. Sauget edited Hom.
               37 (1969: ‘On the Ascension of Jesus Christ’). Homilies that exist in Syriac, but
               have not yet been edited are: nos. 3 (‘On the Incarnation’; Leroy, 75); 10 (‘On Holy
               Friday’; Leroy, 110–11); 13 (‘On the Pascha’; Sauget 1969, 6); 30 (‘On Holy Friday
               and on the Trinity’, which does not exist in Greek; Sauget 1961, 406 and Leroy,
               212–23).</p>
                    <p>Among Proclus’s correspondence, one letter in particular became very influential: the
               letter that he wrote as patr., probably in 435, to the Armenians, which is known as
               the ‘Tomos to the Armenians’ (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 5897). Written shortly after
               the Council of Ephesus (431), it contains a balanced, albeit somewhat vague,
               Christological exposition, which was understood as a rejection of dyophysite
               Christology associated with the names of <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref> (neither of whom is mentioned by name in
               the text). There exist three different Syriac versions: the first is preserved in a
               7th-cent. miaphysite Florilegium (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,557) and was edited by
               Bedjan; the second was incorporated in the Ecclesiastical History attributed in Syr.
               to <ref rend="bold">Zacharias</ref> (ed. Brooks); the third was included in a 6th-cent.
               miaphysite Florilegium (ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,156) and remains unpublished. Whereas
               the first and second version represent the same translation (of which the text in
               Ps.-Zacharias is a revision), the third version is an independent and more accurate
               translation of the Greek, which probably belongs to the early 6th century, while the
               other translation is typologically earlier.</p>
                    <p>Proclus’s works were often used in later Christological treatises and florilegia.
                  <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> quotes both from the homilies and from the
               ‘Tomos’, while Miaphysite florilegia contain several excerpts from the ‘Tomos’.
               Quotations from Proclus in the works attributed to <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon Maron</ref>
               and in the later Maronite tradition have been studied by Breydy.</p>

                    <p>The Syriac Apocryphal Psalms are a group of five poetic compositions related to the
               book of Psalms (ed. Baars). The most important textual witness for the Syriac
               Apocryphal Psalms is ms. Baghdad (formerly Mosul), Library of the Chaldean
               Patriarchate 1113, which can be dated paleographically to the 12th cent. In this ms.,
               the Apocryphal Psalms follow directly upon the canonical Psalms and are numbered
               consecutively as 151–155. The margins of this ms. contain a number of alternative
               readings. The Syriac Apocryphal Psalms are also found as filler material in mss. of
               the <hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-Durrāšā</hi> ‘Book of Exercise’ by <ref rend="bold">Eliya
                  of al-Anbār</ref> (first half of the 10th cent.). The order of the Apocryphal
               Psalms in mss. of the <hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-Durrāšā</hi> differs from that in the
               Chaldean Patriarchate ms. (I = 151; II = 154; III = 155; IV = 152; V = 153). In
               addition, the text of the Apocryphal Psalms in these mss. diverges from that in the
               Chaldean Patriarchate ms., though it often agrees with that represented in the
               margins of this ms. A version of the Apocryphal Psalms similar to that in mss. of the
                  <hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-Durrāšā</hi>is also found appended to ms. Berlin,
               Orient. Fol. 3122, which contains the prophetic books of the OT. Finally, Psalm 151
               (= I) also exists in Syriac outside the collection of Apocryphal Psalms, both in the
                  <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref> (and in liturgical mss. based on it) and in some
               mss. independent from, and in some cases earlier than, the Syro-Hexapla (see Baars,
               vii-ix; van Rooy 2000).</p>
                    <p>Psalm 151 (= I) is a translation of the Septuagint Psalm 151. This Psalm is known in
               other Psalter traditions that are based on the Septuagint, e.g. Latin, Coptic,
               Arabic, Armenian, and Ethiopic. The Hebrew Vorlage of Psalm 151 was discovered
               fragmentarily preserved in the Qumran Psalms Scroll (11QPs<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>) as two separate psalms designated 151A and 151B (ed. Sanders 1963; 1965,
               54–64). A Hebrew Vorlage for both Psalm 154 (= II) and Psalm 155 (= III) is also
               found in the Qumran Psalms Scroll (11QPs<hi rend="superscript">a</hi>; ed. Sanders
               1964; 1965, 64–76). A Hebrew Vorlage has not, however, been discovered for either
               Psalm 152 (= IV) or Psalm 153 (= V). Some maintain that this is only an accident of
               survival and that these two Psalms were translated from a now lost Hebrew Vorlage
               (see, e.g., van Rooy, van der Woude). Others, however, argue that these two Psalms
               are original Syriac compositions (see, e.g., Skehan). In his Letter 47, Cath. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref> (d. 823) mentions the discovery of Hebrew mss., some
               of which contained additional ‘Psalms of David’, in the region of Jericho (ed. O.
               Braun, ‘Ein Brief des Katholikos Timotheos I über biblische Studien des 9.
               Jahrhunderts’, <hi rend="italic">OC</hi> 1 [1901], 299–313; ET in S. P. Brock, <hi rend="italic">A brief outline of Syriac literature</hi>[2nd ed. 2009], 240–45).
               This not only anticipates the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls by more than a
               millennium, but also may help to explain the existence of Psalms 154–155 (and
               possibly also 152–153) in the Syriac tradition.</p>

                    <p>Town in the Qalamun mountains, Syria, ca. 95 km. northeast of <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref> and less than 20 km. north of Nabk (see <ref rend="bold">Dayr Mār
                  Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>), often mentioned as a caravan station between <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref> and Damascus. Qara’s Christian history can be traced back to
               the 5th cent. (mentioned as Chonachara or Chonochara). In the Christological
               controversies of the 5th and 6th cent. it was on the side of the Chalcedonians. After
               a long period during which the sources are silent, Qara reemerges around 1100, still
               as a center of <ref rend="bold">Melkite</ref> Christianity. Bp. Michael of Qara is
               attested for the second half of the 12th cent., and he himself has left us a list of
               some of his predecessors (Schmidt, 27–9). The Muslim authors Ibn Jubayr (who visited
               Qara in July 1184) and Yāqūt (1225) report that in their day Qara was entirely
               Christian. In 1266, however, Sultan Baybars, in his offensive against the Crusaders
               and Mongols, expelled or killed the Christians of Qara, which then became a Muslim
               town. It was able to regain some of its Christian population in the following decades
               and to recreate its episcopal see, no later than ca. 1400. In the first half of the
               15th cent. Bp. Makarios built a scriptorium in Dayr Mar Yaʿqub, in which a number of
               Syriac and Arabic mss. were produced, mostly by bps. and priests belonging to some
               influential families. In the 17th cent., due to the ongoing islamization of the
               Qalamun region, the episcopal see of Qara lost its independence and was joined
               together with Ṣaydnāyā. The Monastery of Mar Yaʿqub, which had lost some of its
               earlier prestige, was destroyed by an earthquake in 1759 and remained in ruins. In
               the 18th cent., Qara moved into the orbit of the Melkite-Catholic Church, to which
               most of the small Christian minority of Qara’s population nowadays belong.</p>
                    <p>Today Qara has two historically important Christian sites, both of which are still in
               use. One is the Church of Sts. Sergius and Bacchus; the other is Dayr Mar Yaʿqub,
               just outside the town. The Church of Sergius and Bacchus contains partly preserved
               wall paintings, some of which have inscriptions in Greek and Syriac (<ref rend="bold">Esṭrangela</ref>). The upper parts of five scenes are preserved on the north wall
               of the church: the breastfeeding Virgin, flanked by two equestrian saints, Theodore
               (left) and Sergius (right); John the Baptist; and (traces of) an unidentified female
               saint.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ref rend="bold">Dayr Mar Yaʿqub</ref>, dedicated to the E.-Syr. saint <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub ‘the mutilated’</ref> (‘the dissected’, Syr. <hi rend="italic">mpassqā</hi>, Arab. <hi rend="italic">muqaṭṭa</hi>ʿ, or Lat. Intercisus; cf.
               Fiey, <hi rend="italic">Saints syriaques</hi>, 107–8), is first attested with this
               name in the 15th cent. (Schmidt, 43). Its main church, however, in all likelihood
               goes back to the 11th cent. After it had fallen into ruins, in the 18th cent., it was
               neglected for more than two centuries; several of its wall paintings were transferred
               to the National Museum of Damascus and to the museum of nearby Dayr ʿAtiya. It was
               only in the 1990s that, under the leadership of Sœur Agnès-Maria de la Croix, the
               monastery with its church was rebuilt and became the home of a community of female
               ascetics, belonging to the jurisdiction of the Melkite-Catholic bp. of Ḥimṣ, Ḥama,
               Yabrud, and Qara. Within the framework of this rebuilding and restoration project
               several of the paintings were returned to the monastery. Together with the newly
               discovered paintings, they were studied in a monograph by Schmidt and Westphalen
               (2005).</p>
                    <p>The church of the monastery has a remarkable structure in that it consists of an
               upper and lower church, sharing the same apse construction. Accordingly, there are
               two parallel levels of decoration which, moreover, each were decorated twice, first
               in the 11th  cent. and again in the 13th cent. (before 1266). The various
               iconographic programs can be reconstructed only very imperfectly. Among the earliest
               paintings, there is a row of enthroned apostles (upper apse) and scenes from the life
               of Christ (nave of the lower church, probably by a different artist). As for the
               13th-cent. layer, there are remnants of a large Deisis composition in the lower apse.
               In addition, both apses have a row of images of bps. or church fathers. Although
               heavily damaged, a few still show inscriptions with their names written in Greek and
               Syriac (Esṭrangela, running from top to bottom). Independent from the paintings, and
               written on the first layer of plaster, are two carefully written prayers, one in
               Syriac (Schmidt, 151–2) and one in Greek.</p>
                    <p>In addition to their significance for art-historical studies and as a witness of the
               ongoing presence of Christian culture in the Qalamun mountains, the paintings and
               inscriptions in Qara provide precious information on the use of Syriac among the
               Melkites.</p>

                    <p>A sizable town located to the east of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, on the same road
               along which <ref rend="bold">Barṭelle</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Karamlish</ref> are
               located. Its name is Turkish, lit. ‘the black bird’, but it is also called in Syriac
                  <hi rend="italic">Beth Khudedā</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Bukhdedā</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Baghdedā</hi> (among other conflicting spellings) and in Arabic <hi rend="italic">al-Ḥamdāniyya</hi>. Its history is best known from the 12th   cent.
               onward although the town must have existed much earlier. Qaraqosh contains the
               remains of at least three maphrians, Yuḥanon IV (1189) and two others who lived
               during the 15th cent. In his Chronicle, <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> mentions it
               as the scene of violence at the hands of Kurds and Tatars, and in his Ecclesiastical
               History he discusses the mostly good relations between the local people and the
               maphrians residing in <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>. Monks native to
               Qaraqosh are attested in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>,
               and <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> in Egypt. Here lived the highly skilled
               scribe and miniaturist Bacchus as evidenced in one ms. dated to 1257. The invasion of
               the Persian Nādir Shāh in 1743 destroyed it almost entirely, but it was soon rebuilt
               magnificently as reflected in the art, architecture, and Syriac <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref> of its churches. The bp. of <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor
                  Behnam</ref>, Karas of ‘Khudeda’ played a crucial role in the rebuilding
               activities. There are currently nine churches in Qaraqosh, some truly monumental,
               including two recent ones. In antiquity Qaraqosh belonged to the Ch. of E., but it
               shifted to the Syr. Orth. Church around the beginning of the 7th cent. under the
               influence of Dayro d-Mor Matay, and around the middle of the 18th cent., it turned
               almost entirely Syr. Cath. In the late 1950s it was inhabited by some seven thousand
               people speaking <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref>, but the number today is less
               certain.</p>

                    <p>The Qarqaphto (‘Skull’) Monastery was located near the town of Magdal on the Khabur
               river southeast of <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref>, in the Jazīra region of Syria.
               According to tradition, a certain Mor Shemʿun was the founder of this monastery. The
               Qarqaphto Monastery blossomed between the 8th and 10th cent. and was famous as a
               center for biblical philology.</p>
                    <p>There is little direct archeological or ms. evidence from the Qarqaphto Monastery.
               One surviving ms. from this monastery is dated to 839 (Brit. Libr. Add. 17,215). The
               fragments of this ms. contain comments on Greek philosophical vocabulary in Syriac.
               References to the monks of the Qarqaphto monastery are also found in mss. of the
               so-called Syriac <ref rend="bold">Masora</ref>. A small number of these mss. (Vat. Syr.
               152, Brit. Libr. Add. 7183, and Damascus Patr. 12/22) attribute vocalized selections
               from the OT and NT to the ‘Qarqaphian tradition’ (<hi rend="italic">mašlmonutho
                  qarqphoyto</hi>). Most Syriac Masora mss. also contain marginal notes attributed
               to monks of the Qarqaphto Monastery (<hi rend="italic">qarqphoye</hi>) along with
               notes by other philologists.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> is the best-known source of information for writings
               associated with the Qarqaphto Monastery. In the introduction to his grammar ‘The Book
               of Splendors’ (<hi rend="italic">Ktobo d-ṣemḥe</hi>), Bar ʿEbroyo attributes the
               development of W.-Syr. Greek vowel signs to Qarqaphto monks. He also includes <hi rend="italic">qarqphoye</hi> biblical readings in his Scriptural commentary the
               ‘Storehouse of mysteries’ (<hi rend="italic">Awṣar roze</hi>). In his ‘Candelabrum of
               the sanctuary’ (<hi rend="italic">Mnorat qudše</hi>), Bar ʿEbroyo lists the <hi rend="italic">qarqphoyto</hi> as a ‘version’, or ‘translation’, (<hi rend="italic">mappaqto</hi>) of the NT used by the Syr. Orth., along with the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> and the <ref rend="bold">Ḥarqlean</ref> (PO 31.1, 120). At times Bar
               ʿEbroyo disagrees with the biblical readings of the Qarqaphto monks.</p>
                    <p>Scholars working before the mid-19th cent. such as <ref rend="bold">J. S.
                  Assemani</ref> and N. Wiseman believed that these references to the <hi rend="italic">mašlmonutho qarqphoyto</hi> and <hi rend="italic">qarqphoye</hi> in
               the Syriac Masora and in the works of Bar ʿEbroyo were allusions to a ‘version’ or
               ‘revision’ of the Bible. The inclusion, in these same writings, of the term <hi rend="italic">mašlmonutho</hi> in reference to the ‘versions’ of the Ḥarqlean and
                  <ref rend="bold">Syro-Hexapla</ref> seemed to legitimize the translation ‘version’
               when used for <hi rend="italic">qarqphoyto</hi>. In the late 19th-cent. J. P. P.
               Martin argued that <hi rend="italic">mašlmonutho qarqphoyto</hi> was not a ‘version’
               of the Bible, but a ‘tradition’ of vocalizing and pointing the biblical text
               transmitted by the monks of the Qarqaphto Monastery. Martin’s conclusions were
               eventually accepted by the majority of scholars, although some disagreed. One of the
               most vocal opponents of Martin was Isaac Hall who fought against what he called ‘Abbé
               Martin’s hoax’ (Hall 1885) in published articles and in presentations to the
               newly-minted Society of Biblical Literature. It is now generally understood that the
               works of eminent philologists from the Qarqaphto Monastery influenced the compilers
               of Syriac Masora mss. But the exact role monks from Qarqaphto played in the
               composition and transmission of all or part of the existing masoretic mss. remains
               unclear.</p>

               one or the other of the two choirs begins the service. Thus the weeks are also styled

                    <p>A W.-Syr. monastery that in its heyday (6th–9th cent.) stood out as a center of Greek
               study in the Syriac-speaking Near East and which played a key role in the
               transmission of Greek learning into Syriac. ‘Qenneshre’ means ‘eagles’ nest’ and
               should not be confused with the northern Syrian town of Qenneshrin or Chalcis (Ar.
                  <hi rend="italic">Qinnasrīn</hi>). Arabic sources refer to the monastery as
               Qinnisrī. According to Yāqūt, Qenneshre was located on the eastern shore of the
               Euphrates River in the Jazīra, facing Jirbās (i.e. Europos), four parasangs from
               Mabbug, seven parasangs from Serugh. Yāqūt also adds that Qenneshre was a ‘large’
               monastery that had some 370 monks when it was inhabited.</p>
                    <p>In the context of increasing imperial pressure on miaphysite monks throughout
               northern Syria, <ref rend="bold">John bar Aphtonia</ref> led a group of monks from the
               monastery of St. Thomas near Seleucia Pieria, where he was Abbot, to the banks of the
               Euphrates and there founded Qenneshre ca. 530; some evidence suggests that it, too,
               may have been dedicated to St. Thomas. Scholars disagree as to whether mention of the
               ‘monastery of Beth Aphtonia’ in Syriac texts should be understood as a reference to
               Qenneshre. The monastery of St. Thomas in Seleucia-Pieria seems to have been known as
               a center of Greek studies and Qenneshre continued this tradition. <ref rend="bold">Tumo
                  of Ḥarqel</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Athanasios II of Balad</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> all studied Greek at Qenneshre. <ref rend="bold">Severos
                  Sebokht</ref>, Athanasios II’s teacher, was also likely associated with the
               monastery and <ref rend="bold">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>, probably studied
               there as well. Many important translations from Greek into Syriac of both secular and
               religious works were undertaken by these men and others trained at Qenneshre. A note
               in ms. Oxford (Bodleian) Poc. 10, which contains the hymns of Severus translated by
                  <ref rend="bold">Pawla of Edessa</ref>, informs us that Pawla’s translation was made
               ‘according to the tradition of Qenneshre.’ A study of the translation technique of
               scholars trained at Qenneshre remains a desideratum. Qenneshre also played a
               significant role in the life of the Syr. Orth. Church, providing it with a number of
               bishops and no less than seven Patriarchs.</p>
                    <p>At some point after the death of Hārūn al-Rashīd in 809, perhaps ca. 811, Qenneshre
               was plundered and burned by a band of Arabs probably associated with the rebel leader
               Naṣr b. Shabath al-ʿUqaylī. Around 820, Patriarch <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel
                  Maḥre</ref> (himself, a product of the monastery) obtained permission from ʿUthmān
               b. Thumāma to rebuild it. Ibn al-ʿAdīm’s (d. 1262) <hi rend="italic">Bughyat al-ṭalab
                  fī taʾrīkh Ḥalab</hi> contains a brief anecdote related to Qenneshre, the contents
               of which suggest that the monastery was a popular spot for visitation and revelry for
               people from Mabbug into the reign of Sayf al-Dawla (d. 967). At some point in the
               Middle Ages, perhaps the mid-13th cent., Qenneshre ceased to be inhabited.</p>
                    <p>In the 1990s, Spanish archaeologists conducting rescue operations in the Tishrin Dam
               area in northern Syria identified a large monastic site near the confluence of the
               Sayūr and Euphrates Rivers as being the location of Qenneshre. In late 2005 and early
               2006, however, Syrian archaeologist Yousef al-Dabte conducted excavations at a site
               on the eastern shore of the Euphrates, directly across from the modern Syrian town of
               Jarablus (Jirbās) and identified it as Qenneshre. The results of al-Dabte’s one
               season of work remain only partially published, but for a variety of reasons,
               al-Dabte’s site is more likely to be that of the actual Qenneshre. Planned
               publication of analyses of pottery and inscriptions already found offer the prospect
               of much new information about the history of the monastery. At present, further
               excavations at the site are intended but contingent upon funding.</p>

               the Crucifixion, Wheat and its symbolism, and Zacchaeus. (In the unique ms. only that
               on the Crucifixion and the incursion of the Huns are specifically attributed to

                    <p>Quryaqos tried to take decisive steps against the eucharistic formula (said to be of
               Nestorian tendency) ‘Panem caelestem frangimus’, which for a long time had been
               causing much dissension in the Church, but because of the danger of a schism was
               tolerated by the previous patriarchs. Quryaqos’s solution (at a synod in Beth Bathin
               in 795) did not bring the controversy to its end. On the contrary it brought about an
               open schism, as all other dissidents united with the party of the followers of the
               formula. The center of the opposition was the monastery of Gubba Barraya and the
               diocese of Cyrrhus, the bp. of which had been deposed by Quryaqos. At the synod
               summoned in 807/8 in Gubrin the dissenting bishops were deposed. Then they elected a
               monk of Qarṭmin, Abraham, an anti-patriarch. He sought recognition by the Coptic
               Patr. Markos, but due to Quryaqos’s intervention was excommunicated by Markos. This,
               however, did not put an end to the schism and it existed over the whole period of
               Quryaqos’s pontificate. One of the results of the machinations of the dissidents was
               that Caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd gave orders to destroy churches in the region of
               Tagra.</p>
                    <p>In some cases Quryaqos seems to have supported hierarchs who were disliked by their
               congregations. Such was the case with Shemʿon, the metropolitan of Tagrit (only the
               death of whom brought peace to the diocese) and with Basilios, his successor. The
               latter soon fell into a conflict with the people of Mosul, as he opposed their choice
               of Daniel, of the powerful <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref>, as their bp.
               Quryaqos who supported the authority of Basilios (as the metropolitan of Tagrit, the
               position later known as maphrianate), formally had precedence over other
               metropolitans of the ‘East’ (i.e. the part of the Syr. Orth. Church on the former
               territory of the Persian [Sasanian] state). Quryaqos tried to solve the conflict by a
               conciliatory decree (<ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, Chronicle,
               495f/IIIb,33–35).</p>
                    <p>In the atmosphere of conflicts within the church’s hierarchy the discipline among the
               priests and monks diminished. Quryaqos tried to improve that by instituting canons at
               two synods: in Beth Bathin near Ḥarran in November 794 (46 canons) and in Ḥarran in
               812/13 (26 can.).</p>
                    <p>His literary works include responsa, a liturgy (anaphora), a collection of <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> on theological themes (incomplete), a biography of <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> (discovered by A. Vööbus), letters (three of
               which are quoted by Michael Rabo) and a synodal letter to the Coptic Patriarch Markos
               being a profession of faith (preserved in Arabic translation).</p>

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>(411/2–435/6). Born into an aristocratic family in
               Qenneshrin (Chalcis), son of a pagan father and a Christian mother, Rabbula converted
               to Christianity as an adult, leaving his mother, wife, and children for the monastic
               life. Before long, he was elected Bp. of Edessa, where he became one of the great
               church leaders of his time. A fierce advocate for <ref rend="bold">Cyril of
                  Alexandria</ref> in the emerging Christological debates, Rabbula was said to have
               campaigned violently against pagans, ‘heretics’, and Jews, and to have destroyed four
               temples and a synagogue. Rabbula was also renowned for his work among the poor, for
               building hospitals, for regulating clergy, monastics, and members of the Covenant
                  (<ref rend="bold">Bnay qyāmā</ref>) with extensive legislation; for promoting a
               revised translation of the New Testament, and for composing numerous hymns. His
               extant writings are few, and some of dubious authenticity: several collections of
               rules governing church order, a sermon he delivered in Constantinople (in Syriac
               translation), a few letters including correspondence with Cyril, and various hymns.
               There is a magnificent hagiography in his honor.</p>

            four Gospels, preceded by an important set of illuminations (f. 1r-14v).<note/>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Syriac ms. (now Florence, Bibl. Mediceo-Laurenziana, Pluteus I,56) containing the
               four Gospels, preceded by an important set of illuminations (f. 1r–14v). A colophon
               (f. 292r–v) provides the name of the scribe, Rabbula (who is otherwise unknown), and
               of those who contributed to the production of the ms. (the miniaturists are not
               named), as well as the date (Febr. 586) and the place of origin: the Monastery of
               Beth Mar Yuḥanon of Beth Zagba. This monastery, no longer in existence, was probably
               situated in the Djebel Riḥa, some 50 km. north of <ref rend="bold">Apamea</ref>, in
               Syria (see Mundell Mango 1983).</p>
                    <p>While this ms. ranks among the earliest dated mss. of the Four Gospels (see <ref rend="bold">Bible, NT manuscripts</ref>, under  3), it is even more famous for its
               illuminations. It opens with three full-page illuminations (f. 1r–2r): the selection
               of Matthias, the Virgin and Child (of the <hi rend="italic">Hodegetria</hi> type),
               and standing figures of Ammonius of Alexandria and <ref rend="bold">Eusebius of
                  Ceasarea</ref>. F. 2v–3r show the text, written inside two nicely decorated
               frames, of Eusebius’s ‘Letter to Carpianus’ concerning the use of the Eusebian
               ‘canons’, i.e. synoptic tables listing the parallel passages in the four Gospels. The
               canons themselves follow on f. 3v–12v. They are integrated in architectural
               structures, in which the lists of text references are separated by pillars. These are
               roofed with arches, on top of which a variety of birds and plants are depicted. The
               canons are followed by four more full-page illuminations (f. 13r–14v): the
               Crucifixion with Resurrection, the Ascension, Christ enthroned and approached by four
               men (two of them holding each a book and two others following behind their brothers
               and supporting them), and Pentecost. The text of the Gospels itself (f. 20–291) does
               not contain any further illuminations.</p>
                    <p>The disposition and decoration of the Eusebian canons are of a common type, found in
               both the East and West. Their further elaboration, however, with additional themes
               and motifs, reveals the specific Syriac context of this ms. Folios 3v–9r have in the
               upper register (to the right and left of the arches) OT figures, accompanied by their
               names in Esṭrangela script: Aaron, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Solomon, Hosea,
               Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Zephaniah, Job, Isaiah, Habakkuk, Haggai,
               Zechariah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Malachi, and Elisha. In the middle register (to
               the right and left halfway of the outer pillars) NT scenes are depicted, while the
               right and left corners at the bottom are mostly filled with animals and plants. Some
               of the representations, such as the scenes of Christ’s Nativity and Baptism (with
               fire coming out of the water) and the impressive compositions of the Crucifixion
               (with Christ wearing the purple <hi rend="italic">kolobion</hi>) and the Resurrection
               (with Christ appearing to the two Maries) reflect their Syriac context and are
               reminiscent of <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>’s hymns and other Syriac writings.</p>
                    <p>The ms. in all likelihood originated in a Syr. Orth. environment and subsequently
               came into the possession of the Maronites. For at least two centuries it was housed
               in the Maronite Monastery of Qannubin, in Lebanon, before it was transferred to the
               Florentine library in the 16th cent.</p>
                    <p>There has been much discussion among scholars about the question of whether the quire
               with the illuminations (f. 1–14) and the main part containing the Gospel texts
               originally belonged together. While D. H. Wright in 1973, after personal inspection
               of the ms., reached the conclusion that the illuminations were indeed part of the
               codex that was created in 586, the recent study by P. G. Borbone and A. Mengozzi (in
               Bernabò, 2008) has challenged this widely held view. They point to a <ref rend="bold">Garshuni</ref> note on f. 11v (written between the pillars of the canons) which
               records a significant (judging from the size and formal character of the note)
               donation by two priests to the Monastery of Qannubin in 1460/61. The object of the
               donation is described in the note as <hi rend="italic">al-dast al-kabīr</hi> ‘the
               great <hi rend="italic">dast</hi>’. S. E. Assemani, in his first description of the
               ms. (1742) understood the term <hi rend="italic">dast</hi> to mean ‘copper vessel’,
               while Borbone and Mengozzi argue that it means ‘fascicle, quire’, and see in it a
               reference to the impressive gathering of illuminations which, according to their
               view, would have been joined to the Gospel text only in the 15th cent. This
               interpretation, which has not yet encountered general support (see Mundell Mango, in
               Bernabò 2008, 113–14), does not imply that the illuminations are of a very late date.
               On the contrary, the early date of most of the illuminations (probably 6th cent.)
               should not be questioned and is supported by the Syriac script found on these folios.
               We would be dealing then with the re-use of an early quire of illuminations that had
               become disconnected from its original manuscript.</p>
                    <p>Even while this and other questions continue to exist, the codex is one of the most
               precious illuminated mss. of the ancient world. Sharing so many characteristics with

               have not only been studied intensively, they also have served as a source of

                    <p>A term probably first used by <ref rend="bold">A. Baumstark</ref> to denote a period in
               Syriac literature (11th–13th cent.) of great productivity, characterized by a growing
               acceptance of Arabic science and of Arabic and Muslim cultural and religious
               patterns. Examples include translations/adaptations of Arabic scientific works, the
               introduction of rhymed and rhythmic prose <hi rend="italic">(saj</hi>ʿ, for instance,
               by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>) as well as Arabic verse meters (<hi rend="italic">rajaz, ṭawīl</hi>), a new explanation of Syriac grammar based on
               theories borrowed from Arabic grammarians (<ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb bar Malkon</ref>), and the creation of new literary genres
               (e.g., wine poetry, <hi rend="italic">khamriyyāt</hi>). In the field of
               historiography, one witnesses an increasing use of Muslim sources in Persian and
               Arabic. The same applies to philosophy, where the study of authors like Ibn Sinā,
               Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī, Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī, and Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazālī contributed to
               new developments, e.g., in the works of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref>, Bar
               Malkon, and Bar ʿEbroyo. This Muslim influence can be felt even in the domains of
               theology, spirituality, and canon law. Some modern authors such as <ref rend="bold">J.-B. Chabot</ref> have a negative appreciation of this period on account of the
               loss of original Syriac themes, styles, and patterns.</p>
                    <p>A second characteristic of the Syriac Renaissance seems to be a certain awareness
               (not shared by all authors belonging to this period) that the traditional
               Christological differences between Chalcedonians and E.-Syrians and W.-Syrians were a
               matter of terminology rather than of substance. This development also explains the
               good contacts with European Christians through the Crusader presence in the Middle
               East.</p>
                    <p>The idea of a Renaissance has also been used by scholars in the fields of
               architecture and visual arts, which in the same period were characterized by a
               greater openness to Islamic styles and to influences from the European (Crusaders)
               and Byzantine world.</p>

               ‘spring-head’ in both cases, refer to the large number of springs in the area, from
               which the Khabur draws much of its water. The biblical city of Resen (Gen. 10:12;
               Pesh.: Rasan) was identified with Reshʿayna by <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>
               (Commentary on Genesis, ed. R. M. Tonneau [CSCO 152], 65.25–6) and in the later Syr.
               exegetical tradition (as well as in the Palestinian Targumim). In classical times it
               was also known as Theodosiopolis after Emperor Theodosius I (379–95), who according
               to the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Edessa</ref> ‘founded’ the city in 380/1 (ed.
               Guidi, 5.17–8) and according to Malalas granted it municipal status in 383. The city,
               which was taken by the Arabs in 640, saw brief occupations by the Byzantines in 943
               and by the Franks under Count Joscelin I of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> in around
               1129. It fell into insignificance in the modern period, so that the present-day twin
               city of Raʾs al-ʿAyn-Ceylanpınar is largely a modern foundation created in the late
               19th cent.</p>

               (Asylios/Ascholios?), whom <ref rend="bold">Sergios of Reshʿayna</ref> denounced before
               the Chalcedonian Patr. Ephrem of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> in ca. 535. After the
               Islamic conquest, we hear of the Syr. Orth. bp. Gabriel in 667. The synod at which
                  <ref rend="bold">Athanasios II of Balad</ref> was elected Patr. was held in
               Reshʿayna in 684. The names of nine bishops of Reshʿayna between 724 and 986 are
               known from the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael I Rabo</ref>. In the 11th and
               early 12th cent. the see of Reshʿayna is usually found united with that of <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Among the E.-Syr. authors mentioned by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> are
               Daniel of Reshʿayna (ca. 550) (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">Bib. Or.</hi> III/1, 223)
               and <ref rend="bold">Shalliṭa of Reshʿayna</ref>, the latter of whom is said in mss. of
               his work to have been a bp. Reshʿayna is mentioned as a suffragan of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> in a list of E.-Syr. dioceses in 1007/8.</p>
                    <p>An important monastery in the neighbourhood of Reshʿayna is known under different
               names: 1. <hi rend="italic">Speqlis/ʾEspeqlis</hi>, i.e., ‘Specula’ or ‘Watchtower’
               (mss. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,430 and 12,135[I], two biblical mss., written in 724 and
               726 respectively, by the scribe Sobho of Reshʿayna, ‘who never made a blotted <hi rend="italic">taw</hi>’; see Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi>, vol. I,
               15b–16b and 24b–26a; comp. <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, 9a–10a); 2.
               Asphulos/Asphuloye/Saphylos (Michael Rabo); and 3. Pgimto (<ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref>, ‘Chron. Eccl.’, ed. Abbeloos and Lamy, I.281: <hi rend="italic">Dayro da-Pgimto ʾawkit d-SPWLWS</hi>, which is mentioned here as the monastery of
               origin of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Severos bar Mashqo</ref>). Barsoum claims that it was
               built in the 5th cent. and reduced to ruins shortly before 1203, and that it produced
               two patriarchs and eleven bishops.</p>
                    <p>Two monks who are regularly quoted in the margin of <ref rend="bold">Masora</ref> mss.,
               Ṭubhono and Sobho, may have belonged to the nearby <ref rend="bold">Monastery of
                  Qarqaphto</ref>. Their fame also spread to the Ch. of E., as <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  Bahlul</ref> mentions them in his Lexicon (ed. R. Duval, 1363–4), specifically
               linking them to Reshʿayna and crediting them with an important role in the ‘tradition
                  (<hi rend="italic">mašlmonutho</hi>) of the (two) Testaments’. Whether this monk
               Sobho (whom Bar Bahlul also calls Sanṭo) might be the same as the early–8th-cent.
               Sobho of the ‘Watchtower’, mentioned above, remains an open question (Loopstra argues
               for their identity).</p>
                    <p>On the stretch of the Khabur between Reshʿayna and Hassaka to the south are
               thirty-seven villages settled by refugees from the <ref rend="bold">Hakkari</ref>
               region, mostly members of the Ch. of E., who arrived here via Iraq in 1930’s.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>French Dominican missionary, scholar, writer and poet in <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref>.
               Rhétoré entered the Dominican order in 1861, and he was ordained a priest in 1866.
               After having been master of the novices in Mazères (France) and having been in charge
               of the monastery of Corbara in Corsica, he was sent to the mission of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> in 1874. Between 1874 and 1879 he lived in Mar Yaʿqo, near Dehok, and
               then for two years in Mosul. In 1881 he joined the newly-founded mission of Van, from
               where he often visited the <ref rend="bold">Assyrians</ref> dwelling in the mountains
               between Van and Mosul. He stayed in Van until 1908, but was absent between 1894 and
               1897, to take up an appointment as lecturer in Chaldean and Armenian at the École
               biblique et archéologique française de Jérusalem, and in 1897–98, for a short visit
               home to France. Between 1908 and 1911 he lived in the village of Ashitha, in the <ref rend="bold">Hakkari</ref> mountains. Back in Mosul, during the First World War,
               Rhétoré was taken hostage by the Ottomans and interned in <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>
               and Konia. He witnessed and carefully recorded the persecutions and massacres of
               Christians in 1915 in his <hi rend="italic">Les chrétiens aux bêtes</hi>. In 1918 he
               stayed in Constantinople and two years later went back to Mosul, where he died on 12
               March 1921.</p>
                    <p>Rhétoré regularly published letters and articles in a number of missionary
               periodicals. He also collected, copied, and wrote mss. in <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref>, wrote grammars of <ref rend="bold">Ṭuroyo</ref>, Sureth, and Armenian,
               and an essay on Sureth poetry. Most of this valuable material is unpublished. Like
               the missionaries in <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref>, he contributed to the emergence of a
               literary written form of the Neo-Aramaic vernacular of the Mosul region. He opted for
               moderately classicized spelling and vocabulary. More prescriptive than descriptive,
               his <hi rend="italic">Grammaire de la langue Soureth</hi>is nevertheless a precious
               source for the knowledge of the Neo-Aramaic varieties spoken in the Mosul plain and
               in the Hakkari region.</p>
                    <p>In Sureth Rhétoré composed fables in verse, songs, and poems, sometimes with the
               assistance of the famous native poet David Kora (<ref rend="bold">School of
                  Alqosh</ref>). Rhétoré studied the traditional <ref rend="bold">Dorekthā</ref> genre
               and himself composed a number of hymns, under the pseudonym Yaʿqo Nukhraya ‘Jacques
               l’Étranger’. In 1896, during his stay abroad, some of these texts were edited rather
               unsatisfactorily under the name of David Kora (‘Daoud l’Aveugle’) and were included
               in two collections of the Dominican Press. In the last years of his life, Rhétoré
               composed a <hi rend="italic">Dorekthā</hi>‘On the sufferings of the Christians under
               the Sultan Reshad’, with historical notes and commentary, using the pseudonym of
               Yuḥannan bar Qushta.</p>

            speech but secondarily in writing, with the purpose of influencing the hearers or
            readers.<note/>
                    </note>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>In the widest sense a term designating the artistic use of language, primarily in
               speech but secondarily in writing, with the purpose of influencing the hearers or
               readers. As such rhetoric has arisen in civilizations and languages the world over,
               and in Syriac the most notable extant rhetoric may be thought to be the poetry of
                  <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, which, through the artistic use of the Syriac
               language, was designed to persuade the hearers to adhere to his vision of the
               Christian faith and to dissuade them from the ways of his opponents. Within the
               sphere of European and Near Eastern civilization, however, ‘rhetoric’ often serves as
               a short designation for what may be more precisely termed ‘classical rhetoric’, the
               theory of discourse, applied both to speaking and writing, developed in ancient
               Greece and Rome. This theory or technique was presented in treatises and manuals in
               Greek and Latin, and became, both at elementary and higher levels, a principal
               component of the educational system of classical and late antiquity. With the
               influence of Greek culture in the Syriac-speaking area, classical rhetoric became
               familiar to Syrians and exercised an influence also on Syriac literature, and in this
               sense the term <hi rend="italic">rhiṭuriqe</hi> (or similar) and its cognates are
               employed in Syriac, from the Greek (<hi rend="italic">technē</hi>) <hi rend="italic">rhētorikē</hi>. <ref rend="bold">John bar Aphtonia</ref>, founder of the famous
                  <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref>, was born in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> of a father who, according to a Syriac panegyric of John, ‘partook
               of secular wisdom, as not without foresight it ends up with the art of rhetoric (<hi rend="italic">ummānuthā d-rhiṭruthā</hi>)’.</p>
                    <p>Classical rhetoric categorized discourse as forensic (judgement on the past),
               deliberative (advice for the future), or epideictic (praise or blame), and examples
               of each may be found in Syriac literature. The oration of <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>
               on the three E.-Syr. teachers has been analysed as a speech of defence structured
               according to the precepts of forensic rhetoric, and the <ref rend="bold">Book of
                  Steps</ref> as a set of exhortations patterned after the principles of
               deliberative rhetoric. The clearest examples of the influence of classical rhetoric
               in Syriac, however, fall within the realm of epideictic: an anonymous speech in
               praise of John bar Aphtonia, an oration on <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> by
                  <ref rend="bold">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>, and an oration on <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> by <ref rend="bold">Eli of Qarṭmin</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The ‘Book of Dialogues’ of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub bar Shakko</ref> is evidence that
               even as late as the 13th cent. Syriac scholars accorded rhetoric a place in their
               curriculum of ‘secular wisdom’ consistent with the position it held in late
               antiquity, for Book One of this treatise has four sections devoted to grammar,
               rhetoric, poetics, and the copiousness of the Syriac language, Book Two being devoted
               to logic and philosophy. Most of the sections on rhetoric and poetics are derived
               from the single extant treatise in Syriac devoted entirely to rhetoric, that by <ref rend="bold">Anṭun of Tagrit</ref>. This lengthy treatise (in five Books) exhibits
               several points of contact with classical rhetorical theory, but also some significant
               differences. While naming <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, whose orations
               he knew in Syriac translation, ‘the prince of rhetors’, Anṭun equally admired the
               ‘ornamentation of words’ (the subject of Book Five) produced by Ephrem.</p>
                    <p>The ‘Rhetoric’ of <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>, in modern times the most widely
               admired treatise of Greek rhetoric, was not as influential in late antiquity as the
               works of other Greek writers on rhetoric. It was, however, included by late antique
               Alexandrian philosophers in the Organon, the set of treatises by Aristotle devoted to
               logic. Like other treatises of the Organon, it was rendered into Syriac. The Syriac
               version is lost, but was probably the basis for the ‘old’ (i.e. prior to <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref>) Arabic version, which is extant and was the
               subject of commentaries by Islamic philosophers. The Syriac version was the subject
               of a commentary by <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> in his ‘Cream of Wisdom’,
               although Bar ʿEbroyo also made much use of the Arabic commentary by Avicenna on the
               old Arabic version.</p>

                    <p>Byzantine hymnographer and deacon. Born in <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ (Emesa)</ref>, Romanos
               earned the surname ‘the Melodist’ by composing hymns in Greek which, for the last
               1,500 years, have been regarded as masterpieces. Although he is sometimes credited
               with developing a new Greek poetic form, the <hi rend="italic">kontakion</hi>, it is
               more accurate to call him the perfector of this genre: his hymns are the most perfect
               examples of this form, whose invention antedates him. The <hi rend="italic">kontakion</hi> is credited with introducing the ‘accent’ (or ‘Byzantine’) metric
               into Greek poetry (contrasted with the earlier ‘quantitative’ or ‘Hellenic’ metric).
               Romanos’s <hi rend="italic">kontakia</hi> have also been singled out as the first
               examples of chancel drama, and the predecessor of the medieval mystery and passion
               plays. Romanos’s hymns are rhetorically elegant, theologically sophisticated,
               aesthetically sublime, and psychologically profound; Karl Krumbacher termed him ‘the
               greatest Church poet of all time’.</p>
                    <p>Little is known of Romanos’s life. The liturgical ‘Menaia’ and ‘Synaxaria’ of the
               Byzantine Orthodox Church are our sole sources. They state that he was born in Emesa
               and was ‘of the Hebrew race’. He became a deacon in <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref>, and
               then moved to Constantinople during the reign of Anastasius I (r. 491–518). There he
               lived in the ‘temple’ of the Theotokos in the Kuros. It is reported that in his sleep
               the night before the Feast of the Nativity, Mary appeared to him in a vision and gave
               him a scroll to eat. He then awoke, ascended into the pulpit, and began to sing one
               of his most beautiful and subsequently well-known <hi rend="italic">kontakia</hi>:
               ‘Today the Virgin gives birth to the super-essential one’. Famed during his own life
               for his popular hymns, he is reported to have composed about a thousand <hi rend="italic">kontakia</hi>, although only 59 have been preserved. (Another 29 <hi rend="italic">kontakia</hi> have been attributed to Romanos, but Maas and Trypanis
               correctly reject them. The <hi rend="italic">Akathistos</hi> hymn of the Orthodox
               Church has sometimes been attributed to him, although without convincing evidence.)
               Because Romanos references the destruction of Constantinople by earthquakes and
               subsequent fires, his death must be placed after 552 or possibly 555, for in those
               years earthquakes devastated Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>From an historical and textual standpoint, Romanos’s hymns are significant for four
               reasons. 1. They are a window into the layperson’s mind at the time of Justinian, for
               Romanos was writing for the common person. The hymns are not the high theology argued
               between bishops, vying for political advantage. Rather, the hymns are pastoral works,
               addressing the concerns of the average person and communicating the mysteries of the
               faith in a form understandable to the laity. 2. Romanos’s hymns provide strong
               evidence for a link between Syr. Christian culture and the Greek, Byzantine world.
               Romanos’s dependence — both literary and structural  — upon the Syriac <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> is demonstrable. Both his literary corpus and the account of his
               childhood in Syria suggest that Romanos was bilingual: his scansions often require
               that Semitic names be scanned as in Hebrew or Syriac. Romanos’s hymns often address
               the same themes as Ephrem’s, and sometimes both share the same illustration,
               metaphor, or even turn of phrase. Indeed, the form of the Syriac <hi rend="italic">madrāšā</hi> (stanzas, a refrain, an acrostic, with rhyme) closely parallels that
               of the <hi rend="italic">kontakion</hi>. Other forms used by Ephrem’s Syriac hymns
               and sermons (the <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi>, which is a metrical sermon, and the
                  <hi rend="italic">soghithā</hi>, which has a dramatic, epic element, and which
               often uses dialogue in a free recreation of a biblical episode) find their
               distinctive characteristics transplanted into the Greek world in the <hi rend="italic">kontakia</hi> of Romanos. As a literary form, the <hi rend="italic">kontakion</hi> was clearly derived from Semitic (specifically, Syriac) poetic
               forms. And the Syriac corpus of Ephrem was clearly Romanos’s model for his Greek
               hymns. 3. Romanos’s Greek hymns furthermore betray his dependence on Syriac literary
               sources. His appropriation of Ephrem has been discussed; but he also used Syriac
               biblical texts, sometimes verbatim. He often quotes the Gospels in the form of <ref rend="bold">Tatian</ref>’s <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref>, or in forms found only
               in Syriac sources (e.g. in the <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac Version</ref> of the NT).
               This further underscores his dependence on Syriac sources. 4. Romanos’s hymns
               occasionally contain ancient Judaeo-Christian traditions from what later became
               ‘extra-canonical’ Gospels. An example is the ‘light’ (or ‘fire’) in the Jordan River
               at Jesus’s baptism (also in the ‘Gospel according to the Hebrews’); another is that,
               on the night Jesus was arrested, Peter weeps at the door of the High Priest’s house
                  <hi rend="italic">before</hi> denying Jesus (when Peter hears the cock crow and
               then weeps, that is his <hi rend="italic">second</hi> episode of weeping) (so also
               the ‘Gospel of the Nazoraeans’).</p>

                    <p>Cath. (596–604). He originated from <ref rend="bold">Beth Garmai</ref> and was born ca.
               525. He lived as a shepherd before his village priest saw his ability and started
               teaching him. Sabrishoʿ then went on to the <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref>,
               after which he lived an ascetic life in the region of Qardu and elsewhere. He was
               appointed bp. of Lashom some time after 576, and undertook a number of missionary
               journeys, during one of which he was involved in the conversion of Nuʿman III of <ref rend="bold">Ḥirta</ref>. Shortly after his appointment as Cath. in 596 (at the
               orders of Khusrau II) he convened a synod to deal with various doctrinal and other
               abuses. The acts of the synod contain a preamble which includes a statement of faith,
               an agreement dated 598 made by three monasteries in the Sinjar region (whose monks
               are described as “of Bar Qaiti”), and a Letter by Sabrishoʿ to the same monks. The
                  <hi rend="italic">tešboḥtā Abun dba-šmayyā qaddiš ba-kyāneh</hi>is attributed to
               Sabrishoʿ in some sources (but to <ref rend="bold">Babai</ref> or <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb II</ref> in others).</p>
                    <p>The Life of Sabrishoʿ by his friend ‘Petros the solitary’ is much concerned with his
               miracles (published in Bedjan, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de Mar-Jabalaha, de trois
                  autres patriarches</hi>..., 288–331); the notices about him in the Chronicle
                  of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref> (LXV–LXXII; PO 13.4, 154–78) add some further
               miracles.</p>

                    <p>Author of a hymn for Mid-Lent, preserved in the <hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-Wardā</hi>
               (see <ref rend="bold">Gewargis Warda</ref>) and published by Cardahi. The author is
               called <hi rend="italic">Mawṣlāyā</hi> ‘from <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>’, and in the
               subscription of one ms. it is reported that he was a teacher in the Monastery of Mar
               Michael in Mosul in 1188/89. His significance as a liturgical poet may have extended
               far beyond the one hymn that is known, as the name of ‘Sabrishoʿ of Mosul’ is
               remembered in a 20th-cent. <ref rend="bold">dorekthā</ref> by Thomas Hanna of <ref rend="bold">Karamlish</ref> (ed. by E. Braida, forthcoming in A. Mengozzi, <hi rend="italic">Religious poetry in vernacular Syriac from Northern Iraq</hi>, CSCO
               627–628).</p>
                    <p>In addition, an author by the name of Sabrishoʿ d-Pawlos (‘of Pawlos’, or perhaps
               ‘who [is] Pawlos’, rather than ‘son of Pawlos’) is mentioned among ‘the orthodox
               teachers’ in a list that is found in some E.-Syr. mss. (see, e.g., Vandenhoff; comp.
               Van den Eynde, XXV, Document VIII). While it first seemed reasonable to assume that
               this is the same person, Reinink argued against their identity, because Sabrishoʿ
               d-Pawlos happens to be quoted in the <ref rend="bold">Gannat Bussāme</ref> within a
               passage that is attributed to the 9th-cent. author <ref rend="bold">Ṣharbokht</ref>.
               This would require a significantly earlier date for this second Sabrishoʿ. Regardless
               of what his relationship to Sabrishoʿ bar Pawlos is, no further information on
               Sabrishoʿ d-Pawlos is available.</p>
                    <p>Finally, Scher proposed, albeit only tentatively, that Sabrishoʿ bar Pawlos is to be
               identified as the author of an anonymous commentary on the Bible, preserved in mss.
               Mosul 1–3 (dated 1701), parts of which exist in several other mss. (Scher, 228).
               Although Baumstark gave some additional weight to this proposal, by reiterating it
               (without, however, explicitly endorsing it), no positive evidence in its support can
               be provided. At least some parts of this anonymous commentary must belong to an
               earlier period, and Sabrishoʿ’s authorship is highly unlikely.</p>

                    <p>German scholar of Arabic, Aramaic, and Syriac. Born on 20 July 1845 in Neumünster,
               Schleswig-Holstein, Sachau began studying Near-Eastern languages at Kiel and Leipzig
               in 1863. After receiving his Ph.D. degree in 1867, he studied in Oxford and London.
               In 1869, he was appointed professor of Semitic languages in Vienna; beginning in
               1876, he was professor of Near-Eastern literature in Berlin. In addition, between
               1887 and 1920, he was the first director of the Seminar for Oriental Languages in
               Berlin, which provided language training to public officers in the East, even though
               he himself did not teach there. To prepare them for their interaction with the Muslim
               inhabitants of the newly acquired German colonies in East Africa, he wrote his <hi rend="italic">Muhammedanisches Recht nach schafiitischer Lehre</hi> (3rd ed.
               1897). In 1878–79, he traveled on behalf of the Prussian government to Syria and
               Mesopotamia, where he was able to acquire many Syriac mss. for the library of Berlin.
               Sachau himself described these mss., along with the previously acquired mss. in
               Berlin, in a comprehensive catalogue published in 1899. He returned to the Middle
               East in 1897–98. He wrote extensive and very readable reports describing both of his
               trips to the Middle East. The main fields of his scholarly interest included Arabic,
               Syriac, the epigraphy of earlier dialects of Aramaic, and Neo-Aramaic. In addition to
               Arabic works (by al-Jawāliqī, al-Bīrūnī, and Ibn Saʿd), he edited a number of Syriac
               sources, including several recensions of the Syro-Roman Lawbook (1880 [Syriac,
               Armenian, Arabic], 1907) as well as lawbooks of E.-Syr. patriarchs and bishops
               (1907–14). In his capacity as professor at Berlin University and well-connected to
               the German authorities, he was among the leading German scholars of Near-Eastern
               Studies of his day, even though personally he was not highly esteemed by all of his
               academic colleagues. He died in Berlin, Charlottenburg on 17 Sept. 1930.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Monastic author. He was born in Halmon (<ref rend="bold">Beth Nuhadra</ref>) and took
               up a monastic vocation under the influence of his mother and a saintly woman, Shirin.
               He lived as a monk of the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Beth ʿAbe</ref> until some time
               between 635 and 640, when he was made bp. of <ref rend="bold">Beth Garmai</ref>. His
               views on christology were seen to be too Chalcedonian, and he was deposed at a synod.
               For a while he was re-instated, but then was again deposed. His fine ‘Book of
               Perfection’ is preserved, not quite complete, in a ms. copied in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> in 837. The work is in two parts; the first begins with the dogmatic
               foundations of the moral life of Christians (only parts of this are preserved), and
               then goes on to provide an introduction to the life of perfection, both coenobitic
               and solitary. The second part is devoted to discussion of the different virtues. A
               remarkable feature of the work is the very large number of biblical quotations and
               allusions (and very few references to non-biblical literature). Five Letters and a
               set of maxims on Wisdom also survive.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Professor of Arabic and Syriac in Rome, Venice, and Paris. Syriac scholar. Born in
               Ehden, Lebanon, al-Ṣahyūnī was sent to Rome in 1584, to study at the Maronite
               College. After his studies he taught Arabic and Syriac, first at the College Sapienza
               in Rome and later in Venice. In 1614 he traveled to Paris, in the company of Yūḥannā
               al-Ḥaṣrūnī, where he became professor of Arabic at the Collège Royal (the later
               Collège de France). In addition to Arabic, al-Ṣahyūnī also taught Syriac (‘la langue
               chaldaïque’), albeit on a more informal basis. Along with two other Maronite
               scholars, Yuḥanna al-Ḥaṣrūnī and <ref rend="bold">Ibrāhīm al-Ḥāqilānī</ref>, al-Ṣahyūnī
               was deeply involved in the preparation of the Paris Polyglot Bible, which was printed
               between 1628 and 1645. In contrast to the Antwerp Polyglot (1569–72), in which <ref rend="bold">Andreas Masius</ref>had been involved, the Paris Polyglot included a
               full text of the Syriac OT and NT in the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>version. The
               Peshitta NT, which had previously been published by J. A. Widmanstetter (1555), was
               supplemented with the four minor Catholic Epistles (the ‘Pococke’ epistles) and with
               the Apocalypse in the <ref rend="bold">Ḥarqlean Version</ref>. Al-Ṣahyūnī was in charge
               of the final editing of most of the Syriac and the Arabic, and provided the larger
               part of the accompanying Latin translation of the Syriac texts. The Syr. text of the
               Paris Polyglot served as the basis for the London Polyglot, which was edited by Brian
               Walton (1655–57).</p>
                    <p>In the course of his work, al-Ṣahyūnī came into conflict with G.-M. Le Jay, the
               general editor of the Polyglot (which landed al-Ṣahyūnī in a Paris prison for three
               months in 1640) as well as with al-Ḥāqilānī.</p>
                    <p>In addition to his work for the Paris Polyglot, al-Ṣahyūnī published a Syriac life of
               St. <ref rend="bold">Maron</ref>, which was included in the 1608 edition of the
               Maronite Missal; a 1625 edition and Latin translation of the Syr. Psalms; and an
               edition with LT of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s poem on the divine wisdom
               (1628). He is also known as the copyist of Syr. mss. Paris, Bibl. Nat. 240 (the
               Hexaemeron of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>) and 271 (Bar ʿEbroyo’s poem on
               the divine wisdom).</p>

               Buṭros b. Saka in 1864/5 and studied Syr. under the Chaldean priest Buṭros
               al-Karmalīsi. He was ordained a deacon in 1906, and a priest in 1929. He taught at

               died of cancer in 1931. He was a master scribe and produced over 70 mss., found now

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Monastery and village in <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>. Dayr al-Ṣalīb, also called
               the Monastery of Beth El and located ca. 30 km. northeast of <ref rend="bold">Midyat</ref> and 13 km. north of Ḥaḥ, is to be distinguished from another
               Monastery of the Cross in Defne/ʿAtafiyya near Ḥesno d-Kifo (Hasankeyf). The
               monastery derives its name from a piece of the Holy Cross obtained in Constantinople
               by Mor Aḥo of <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref> (6th cent.), whose tomb is found today
               in a separate chapel outside the main monastic complex. Within the main complex there
               is, besides the main church of the Holy Cross, a church of Mor Ḥworo (disciple and
               successor of Mor Aḥo) and Mor <ref rend="bold">Barṣawmo</ref>.</p>
                    <p>After the Syr. Orth. diocese of Ṭur ʿAbdin was divided into those of Qarṭmin and Ḥaḥ
               in 1088, the bishops of Ḥaḥ regularly resided at Dayr al-Ṣalīb. After the schism of
               1364, Ḥaḥ and Dayro da-Ṣlibo continued as a bishopric under the patriarchate of Ṭur
               ʿAbdin. The last metropolitan of Dayr al-Ṣalīb, Antimus Yaʿqub of Esfes, was killed
               in 1915.</p>
                    <p>The monastic complex, which is said once to have housed 300 monks, provided refuge
               for those living in neighbouring villages and itself became a village in the 19th
               cent. In 1892, O. H. Parry found ‘about twenty Syrian families’ living within the
               monastery with ‘their flocks’. The village, with a reported population of 400 in
               1914, suffered heavy losses during and after the First World War. Anschütz records
               that there were 88 Christians, new-comers from nearby villages and Kurdish-speaking,
               in 1967. In July 2004, Gevriye Arslan, head (<hi rend="italic">mukhtar</hi>) of the
               village since 1983, was murdered by Kurds from the neighborhood seeking to
               appropriate the village’s lands. In 2005, there was one resident nun, along with five
               Christian families, including returnees from Europe, living within the monastic
               complex.</p>

               (1957–95). He was born in Ḥulwa near <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> in 1907, and lost
               his father at an early age. His mother took him to the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of
                  St. Mark</ref> in Jerusalem where they both lived, and where he later became a
               monk. In 1931 he was part of the entourage of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Eliya III</ref> in
               a visit to India. He studied in Egypt and became editor of the <hi rend="italic">Patriarchal Magazine</hi> (Jerusalem). He became an abbot of the monastery and in
               1946 was consecrated bp. of Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>In 1947 he purchased from Arab bedouins through Iskandar Shahin (Kando), a Syriac
               antiquity dealer from Bethlehem, four Dead Sea Scrolls, later to be known as the St.
               Mark’s Scrolls. In 1948, he traveled with the Scrolls to the United States for the
               purpose of making the Scrolls available to a wider market. In the United States, the
               scrolls were displayed at various institutions, including the Library of Congress and
               Duke University. After some complications, the Scrolls were purchased by Y.  Yadin,
               through an intermediary, for the State of Israel.</p>
                    <p>In 1948 he was appointed Apostolic Legate to the United States, and in 1957 he became
               the first bp. of the United States and Canada. He was instrumental in the advancement
               of this new diocese. He is remembered by many parishioners for his humility and for
               the help that he rendered to new immigrants, sometimes even taking old ladies
               shopping for food in his car. In 1971 he took part in the consecration of the Coptic
               Pope Shenouda  III. In addition to his English autobiography (1966, AT 1985), he
               wrote a series of Syriac readers entitled <hi rend="italic">mhadyono dšarwoye
                  l-lešono oromoyo</hi>  / <hi rend="italic">Aramaic new method readers</hi> (vols.
               1–3, Jerusalem, 1937–45; vols. 4–6, Glanerbrug, 1984); critics, however, claim that
                  <ref rend="bold">Qarabashī</ref> may have had a hand in authoring them. He was
               instrumental in editing and publishing liturgical texts, with facing ET by <ref rend="bold">Murad Barsoum</ref>, for many of the Syr. Orth. liturgical books, most
               notably the <hi rend="italic">Anaphora of St. James</hi> (1967, ET only), <hi rend="italic">The sacrament of holy baptism</hi> (1974), <hi rend="italic">The
                  order of solemnization of the sacrament of matrimony</hi> (1974), <hi rend="italic">The order for the burial of the dead</hi> (1974), the <hi rend="italic">mʿadʿdono</hi> entitled <hi rend="italic">Ma’de’dono: The book of

                  divine liturgies</hi>(1991) containing thirteen anaphoras. He was also a skillful
               scribe (many of the inscriptions in the United States are molded from his hand). He
               died in 1995 and was buried in the Monastery of St. Ephrem in The Netherlands
               according to his Last Will and Testament, which also stipulated that his substantial
               estate be used for educational purposes and the training of clergy, now administered
               by the Athanasius Yeshu Samuel Fund.</p>

                    <p>Monk and poet. Sargis bar Waḥle from Adharbayjān, was a monk in the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Rabban Hormizd</ref>near <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref>, possibly
               around the turn of the 15th–16th cent. He wrote a lengthy metrical poem on the
               founder of this monastery, Rabban Hormizd, consisting of 22 <hi rend="italic">tarʿe</hi> (strophes), according to the letters of the Syriac alphabet, set in
               end rhyme and intended to be recited on the occasion of the saint’s <hi rend="italic">dukrānā</hi>. Its language is artificial and characterized by the extensive use
               of rare words and Greek loan words. A metrical poem on Mar Aḥa, which existed in ms.
               (olim) Diyarbakır 76, is said to have been written in a more natural style (Scher).
               Abūna’s and Macuch’s assumption that Sargis is also the author of <ref rend="bold">ʿonyāthā</ref> on the E.-Syr. Catholicoi as well as on Rabban Khudahwi and
               Sabrishoʿ of Beth Qoqa is based on an erroneous interpretation of the passage on

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Sargis Bḥira is the name of a Syriac monk who allegedly met the Prophet Muḥammad and
               inspired him to begin preaching to the Arabs. The earliest reference to this
               legendary figure is to be found in the E.-Syr. ‘Disputation of the Monk of Bet Ḥale
               with an Arab notable’, which is commonly dated to the early 8th  cent. In this
               religious dialogue the monk-protagonist asserts that the Qurʾānic teaching regarding
               the Word of God and his Spirit (cf. Qurʾān 4:171) is to be traced back to Sargis’s
               instruction of the Prophet. In the early 9th  cent., when the polemics between
               Muslims and Syriac-speaking Christians burgeoned, the rumors about this Christian
               tutor of the Prophet were spun out into the Syriac ‘Legend of Sargis’. This story
               relates how a monk received an apocalyptic vision on Mount Sinai about the imminent
               rise of Arab rule. In this vision, a sequence of theriomorphic appearances,
               interpreted by an angel, makes clear that the Umayyads fulfilled the prophecy of Gen
               17:20 regarding the twelve princes of Ishmael, while the rule of the Abbasids is
               projected to end with Caliph al-Maʾmūn (r. 813–833). It is described how, after
               having received this apocalyptic vision, the monk begins to preach the veneration of
               one single cross, which leads to his persecution by local ecclesiastical authorities.
               Fleeing to the desert of Arabia, he meets Muḥammad and informs him that he is
               destined to become the leader of the Arabs. The monk also tells Muḥammad about his
               religion and instructs him in a simplified form of Christianity. He urges Muḥammad to
               convert the Arabs to the one true God and designs a number of religious rituals and
               precepts for them, which the monk eventually codifies in the Qurʾān. The legend ends
               with another prophecy about the political and social turmoil under the Abbasids,
               their final collapse, and the exclusive redemption of Christians at the end of time.
               This highly polemical tale, which claims that the Qurʾān was written by human hands,
               has strong apologetic overtones, inasmuch as it suggests that the historical Muḥammad
               was essentially supportive of Christianity and that he summoned Muslim leaders never
               to do harm to the Christian communities.</p>
                    <p>The legend survives in two Syriac redactions (E.-Syr. and W.-Syr.). Arguments have
               been presented by modern scholars as to which Syriac community composed the first
               version, none of which can be regarded as decisive. There are also two Arabic
               versions, which go into more detail about the supposed Qurʾānic echoes of Christian
               teachings.</p>
                    <p>In numerous Muslim biographies of the Prophet, including the early 9th-cent.
               redactions of <hi rend="italic">al-Sīra al-Nabawiyya</hi> by Ibn Isḥāq, there are
               references to a monk who recognized Muḥammad, prior to his first revelation, as the
               awaited new Prophet. In these stories the monk is called only Baḥira, in
               contradistinction to the ‘Sargis Bḥira’ of the Syriac accounts. Several modern
               scholars have tried to find a link between the legendary stories about Muḥammad’s
               alleged teacher and historical figures called Sergios found in Syriac sources. Taking
               into consideration, however, that the Syriac legend is most probably a polemical
               adaptation of the Islamic stories, i.e. presupposing the primacy of the latter, it is
               likely that Syriac speakers provided this monk with a supplementary name. They may
               have added the name Sergios, because Baḥira was not commonly known as a proper name
               in Syriac. It is an epithet for someone ‘tested and approved’ by God, (i.e.
               ‘venerable’, or ‘eminent’).</p>
                    <p>The idea that Muḥammad was taught by a monk lives on among Eastern Christians. It has
               been perpetuated in a vast array of accounts with remarkably diverse interpretations
               of the monk’s supposed intentions and his role in the genesis of Islam.</p>

                    <p>‘Sayfo’, or ‘the sword’, is the term now commonly used for the large-scale massacres
               of the Syriac (as well as the Armenian) inhabitants of eastern Turkey in 1915 and
               following years, in the course of World War I and its aftermath (another term also
               used is ‘Firman’, denoting the order to kill the Christian population; also
               ‘Seferberlik’ denoting mass deportations). Serious massacres had occurred at
               intervals in the 19th cent., notably in 1843 (<ref rend="bold">Hakkari</ref>), 1860
                  (<ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref> and Lebanon), and 1895–6 (eastern Turkey), but
               those of 1915 were evidently orchestrated by high Ottoman officials, in particular
               the Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha. In the area between Urfa (<ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>) and Cizre the massacres and deportations primarily affected the
               Syr. Orth., Syr. Cath. and Chaldeans. The Assyrians, to the east of Cizre, in the
               Hakkari region, having sided with the Russians in 1916, were abandoned after the
               Russian Revolution (1917), and were driven out by the Ottoman army, escaping to the
                  <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref> region (northwest Iran). Subsequently, when Urmia fell,
               large numbers were massacred.</p>
                    <p>The losses to all the Syriac-speaking communities were enormous. Eight out of twenty
               Syr. Orth. dioceses were completely or largely wiped out, and whole areas that had
               formerly had a considerable Syriac presence, notably Bsheriyyeh (Syr. Orth. and
               Chaldean) and Hakkari (Ch. of E.), were totally depleted of their Christian
               population. Reliable figures for those killed or who died in the course of
               deportations are difficult to attain (see Gaunt, 300–303), but in any case for all
               the Syriac Churches in eastern Turkey, the losses of their people formerly living in
               that region were well over 50%, and in some cases as much as 90%.</p>
                    <p> Those who escaped the massacres fled south to Syria, Palestine, or Iraq, and in the
               case of the Assyrians, also Iran or north towards the Caucasus. Although the
               emigration of Middle Eastern Christians to the Americas had begun in the 19th cent.,
               especially after the massacres of 1895/6, it was Sayfo that gave a huge impetus to
               the creation of a massive <ref rend="bold">diaspora</ref> that today accounts for a
               large proportion of all Syriac Christians.</p>

                    <p>He was born Asmar Ṣlewa Scher in 1867 in Shaqlāwa near <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref>.
               Both his father, Yaʿqub, and his grandfather, Yoḥannan b. Ibrāhīm, were priests. He
               studied under his father and in 1879 entered the <ref rend="bold">Seminary of St.
                  John</ref> in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>. He was ordained a priest in 1889 and
               became the secretary of bp. Gabriel Adamo (1873–99) of Kirkuk after whose death Scher
               administered the diocese for one year. In 1900 he became the secretary of the next
               bp., Eliya Khayyāṭ. In 1902 he was consecrated bp. of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref>. In
               1908 he traveled to <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref>, Constantinople, Rome, and Paris
               seeking funds to aid his poor diocese where he met a number of Syriac scholars.
               During World War I, the Ottoman Turks conspired to kill him, but he initially escaped
               with the aid of Kurds under Badr Khan. His escape resulted in a massacre where many
               Christians were killed. Finally, the Turkish army found him, tortured, and beheaded
               him on 15 June 1915. It is said that prior to his escape, he hid the manuscripts that
               he had in a well.</p>
                    <p>Scher published a number of important texts, with FT, in European series and
               periodicals, notably the Chronicle of Siirt (PO 4:3, 1907; 5:2, 1910; 7:2, 1910;
               13:4, 1918), <ref rend="bold">Barḥadbshabba</ref>’s ‘Cause of the Foundation of the
               Schools’ (PO 4:4, 1907), works by Ishai and <ref rend="bold">Ḥenana</ref> (PO 7:1,
               1910), and <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>’s ‘Book of the Scholion’ (CSCO 55,
               69, 1910, 1912). He also published a number of catalogues of collections of
               manuscripts in the Middle East (list in Macuch 403–4). His two most important works
               in Arabic are <hi rend="italic">Kitāb ašhar šuhadāʾ al-mašrīq</hi> (2 vols.; Mosul,
               1900, 1906) and <hi rend="italic">Taʾrīkh Kaldū wa-Āthūr</hi>(2 vols.; Beirut

                    <p>Professor of Semitics; scholar of Syriac, <ref rend="bold">Christian Palestinian
                  Aramaic</ref>, and Arabic. Schulthess was born in Zurich, Switzerland. He studied
               theology in Basel, Göttingen (where he studied with <ref rend="bold">P. A. de
                  Lagarde</ref>), and Zürich, followed by Near Eastern languages at the University
               of Strasbourg (with <ref rend="bold">Th. Nöldeke</ref>, among others). From the latter
               university he received his doctor’s degree in 1894 with a dissertation on the Syriac
               version of the ‘Life of Antony’ by <ref rend="bold">Athanasius of Alexandria</ref>. In
               1895 he received his Habilitation from the University of Göttingen, where he also
               taught for some years. He subsequently held positions at the universities of
               Königsberg (1910–1914), where he succeeded <ref rend="bold">C. Brockelmann</ref>,
               Strasbourg (1914–17), and finally in his home country in Basel (‘Semitic philology’,
               since 1917). He died prematurely in Basel on 4 Jan. 1922.</p>
                    <p>While he also has a number of publications in the fields of Arabic and Islam, his
               scholarly work was primarily focused on Aramaic, in the first place Christian
               Palestinian Aramaic and Syriac. To the field of Christian Palestinian Aramaic he
               contributed two important tools, a dictionary (1903) and a grammar (1924,
               posthumously published, with final editing by E. Littmann and with additional notes
               by both Littmann and Nöldeke). These two publications have remained authoritative
               throughout the 20th cent. and only began to be replaced towards the end of the
               century. Schulthess’s Syriac publications include a number of text editions and
               studies, some of them dealing with texts outside the realm of Syriac religious
               literature, such as the Letter of <ref rend="bold">Mara bar Serapion</ref> (1897), <ref rend="bold">Kalila and Dimna</ref> (1911), and the Sentences of <ref rend="bold">Menander</ref> (1912).</p>

                    <p>In the Greek and Syriac legal documents from Osrhoene dating from the early 240s, it
               is only in the three Syriac documents that the scribe identifies himself by name (see
                  <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac Documents</ref>). This practice continues to be
               frequently found in the <ref rend="bold">colophons</ref> to Syriac literary and
               liturgical manuscripts; there the scribe is normally a deacon, priest, or monk (women
               scribes are extremely rare: one example is a Maronite priest’s daughter [British
               Library, Sloane 3597, of 1701]). In a fairly small number of cases the scribe is also
               the author of the work he is copying; it has been suggested that this may be the case
               with the single ms. of the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>, and it may also
               be the case with the ‘Chronography’ of <ref rend="bold">Eliya of Nisibis</ref>; <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> may possibly have written the ms. containing his
               revision of the Hymns of Severus (Brit. Libr. Add. 17,134). In some other cases the
               scribe is a well-known person, such as Patr. <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, from
               whom several autographs survive (Nau). Other patriarchal scribes are <ref rend="bold">Nuḥ the Lebanese</ref> (ms. Oxford, Marsh 437), Yawsep I (ms. Brit. Libr. Egerton
               703), and <ref rend="bold">Yawsep  II</ref> (3 mss.).</p>
                    <p>Quite often, and especially in the last five centuries or so, the role of scribe
               passes from father to son, and sometimes entire family trees of such families can be
               constructed (Wilmshurst, 244, 249, 251, for scribal families of <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref>). Several writings of much earlier Syriac authors are only preserved
               thanks to a number of scribes active around the turn of the 19th and 20th cent.; one
               of these was the deacon Mattai bar Pawlos of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, working
               between 1872 and 1934, over 40 of whose mss. are now in the Mingana Collection

            (Elephantine, Samaria, etc.).<note>not a summary</note>

                    <p>The Syriac script owes its origin to the Aramaic script of the Achaemenid Persian
               period (539–330 BC) attested to in many documents, especially from Egypt and
               Palestine (Elephantine, Samaria, etc.). Adopted originally from the <ref rend="bold">Arameans</ref> of Syria (who borrowed it from the Phoenicians), the script became
               the vehicle for writing Aramaic as a lingua franca used throughout the Persian
               Empire.</p>
                    <p>After the fall of the Persian Empire, local variants of the script began to develop,
               in centers such as <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>, Petra and Palmyra. One such center
               was <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (modern Urfa) in northern Mesopotamia. Its local
               kings, whose dynastic line appears to go back to about 130 BC (see <ref rend="bold">Abgarids of Edessa</ref>), used a version of the script which by the 1st cent.
               had developed its own characteristics. The first dated inscription in this local
               script, now called ‘Syriac’, dates to 6 and comes from Birecik west of Edessa (Syriac
                  <hi rend="italic">Birtā</hi>, Greek <hi rend="italic">Makedonopolis</hi>). From
               the 1st cent., and then increasingly in the 2nd and 3rd, there have survived
               pre-Christian Syriac <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref> in stone and mosaic, many from
               tombs, in Urfa and its region. From the 3rd cent., we also have legal texts written
               on parchment (see <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac Documents</ref>). There were at least two
               forms of the early Syriac script, a monumental script used for public inscriptions
               and a cursive script used for everyday purposes such as the writing of legal texts on
               soft materials.</p>
                    <p>From the monumental form of the script there developed in the early Christian period
               an elegant ‘book-hand’ used especially in the copying of biblical and theological
               texts. The first dated literary ms. of this kind is dated 411, but this ms. shows a
               maturity and elegance which suggests that the scribal tradition was already well
               established. This formal script came to be known as <hi rend="italic">Esṭrangela</hi>, a word probably of Greek origin (<hi rend="italic">strongulos</hi>)
               meaning ‘rounded’.</p>
                    <p>Alongside this, there existed a cursive script, which is rarely attested, but is
               found occasionally in <ref rend="bold">papyri</ref> and in <ref rend="bold">colophons</ref> of mss. This cursive script continued the cursive script
               tradition found in the early legal parchments. Later it came to be used more widely
               and appears to be the basis of one of the later variants of the Syriac script, the
               one called <hi rend="italic">Serṭo</hi> ‘script’. This form of script was used for
               literary texts from the 8th cent. and is especially associated with the W.-Syr.
               tradition.</p>
                    <p>A third variant of the Syriac script developed in the East. It is an angular version
               of Esṭrangela and, because of its association with the Ch. of E., is often called
               ‘Nestorian’. It is known from about 600, but became very distinctive much later (13th
               cent.).</p>
                    <p>Throughout the early history of the Syriac script, vowels were not fully represented
               in writing, though some diacritical dots were used to distinguish words otherwise
               identical in consonantal form. Eventually Syriac (like Hebrew and Arabic) developed
               vowel signs which were placed above and below the consonants. Two systems emerged,
               probably in the 8th cent., a western system based on adaptations of Greek vowels and,
               apparently a little later, an eastern system consisting of dots.</p>

                    <p>Jurist and historian of Law; professor at the University of Vienna. Selb was born on
               22 May 1929 in Munich. He studied Law in Heidelberg and worked as a judge from 1953
               to 1961. As a Law student, he also studied Syriac and Arabic with Anton Schall. In
               1962, he earned his Habilitation in the fields of Roman Law, History of Law in
               Antiquity, Civil Law, and International Private Law, with a study on the Syro-Roman
               Lawbook. In 1963, he accepted a professorship in Vienna in Roman Law and History of
               Law in Antiquity. In addition to many publications on both contemporary and Roman
               Law, with which he gained high esteem, he devoted himself in several books and
               articles to the history of Law in the Syrian churches. To be singled out are his
               foundational studies on the character and content of the Syro-Roman Lawbook. He was
               one of the co-authors of the new edition (with GT and extensive commentary) of this
               text, which appeared in 2002. He was the first to provide comprehensive introductions
               to the Church Law of the E.- and W.-Syrians (1981 and 1989, respectively). He also
               published a previously unknown source of Roman Law preserved in Syriac, which he
               called ‘Sententiae Syriacae’ (1990, with GT). He undertook many study trips to Turkey
               and Syria in search of Syriac mss. of juridical content. Selb died on 2 June 1994 in
               Bad Vöslau near Vienna.</p>

                    <p>Also known as al-Madāʾin. Located on the Tigris, south of modern <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>. The original Seleucia on the Tigris was established on the west
               side of the river at the end of the 4th cent. BC as a Hellenistic center by Seleucus
               I Nicator. Seleucia was largely abandoned for a new center at Ctesiphon during the
               Parthian period, possibly due to a shift in the course of the Tigris. Although some
               occupation remained in this area, excavations by an American team indicate that the
               occupation was primarily industrial. Although the Parthians established Ctesiphon as
               their capital, its exact location remains uncertain. Based on archaeological
               material, most scholars locate it on the east side of the Tigris, north of <ref rend="bold">Kokhe</ref>. Sasanian and Syriac references to Seleucia-Ctesiphon almost
               certainly refer not to Old Seleucia, but to the city established by the Sasanians on
               the right bank of the Tigris as their administrative capital, which was known as New
               Seleucia, Kokhe, or Veh-Ardashir. Seleucia-Ctesiphon was home to the Cath. of the Ch.
               of E. from at least the early 5th cent. This is known from the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>, which indicates that the synod of <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq</ref>, the first synod, was held in the see of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in
               410.</p>

                <p>A prestigious Roman Catholic theological seminary in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>,
               Iraq, called Séminaire Syro-Chaldéen St. Jean in French. It was founded by the French
               Dominican Fathers in 1878, and though it was closed between the beginning of the
               First World War and 1923, it continued to serve the Chald. and Syr. Catholic churches
               until 1973, when it was shut down by the Iraqi authorities. It was divided into two
               main parts: Le Petit Séminaire, a junior and senior high school which consisted of
               six years of studies after elementary school, where the study of French, Syriac, and
               Arabic language and literature was essential, and Le Grand Séminaire, which consisted
               of two years of Philosophy and four years of Theology, including Biblical Studies.
               Throughout its history, the instruction in both parts of the Seminary was entirely in
               French, and its strength remained in the study of language and literature. Eminent
               scholars graduated from this institution, including 1. <ref rend="bold">Awgen
                  Manna</ref> (1866–1928) who published <hi rend="italic">Dalīl al-rāghibīn fī
                  lughat al-ārāmiyyīn</hi> [Guide for the Students of the Aramaic Language] (Mosul,
               1900), an excellent Syriac-Arabic dictionary; 2. the well-known <ref rend="bold">Alphonse Mingana</ref> (1878–1937) who published among other things the Chronicle
               of <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref> (Mosul, 1907) and <hi rend="italic">Clef de la langue
                  araméenne</hi> (Mosul, 1905), a valuable Syriac grammar; and 3. <ref rend="bold">Addai Scher</ref> (martyred in Turkey in 1915), a prolific writer who published
               the <hi rend="italic">Histoire nestorienne inédite (Chronique de Seert)</hi>. Most of
               the professors were French Dominicans, including the great Syriacist Fr. <ref rend="bold">Jean-Maurice Fiey</ref> (1914–95), who was the Director of the Seminary
               for a short period before he was forced to leave Iraq in 1973. A few Seminary
               Graduates became professors there, as in the case of Mingana in the 1900s, and in the
               1950s and 1960s Fr. Albert Abūnā, professor of Syriac, who published among other
               things the French translation of the second part of the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of
                  1234</ref> (1974). Hundreds of Iraqi priests graduated from this Seminary, many
               becoming bishops and at least one, the Syr. Catholic <ref rend="bold">Gabriel
                  Tappuni</ref> (1879–1968), becoming Patr. The Seminary published several internal
               journals, but the now rare <hi rend="italic">Bulletin du Séminaire Syro-Chaldéen</hi>
               (1940s and 1950s) included scholarly papers on Syriac. In the more recent history of
               the Seminary, Fr. Joseph Omez (1902–74) was its director, and it was thanks to him
               that this institution was modernized and some 84 highly educated and multi-lingual
               priests graduated, some still serving the church of Iraq and elsewhere.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Translator of Greek medical and philosophical texts into Syriac. Most of the little
               that is known of his life has to be gleaned from a paragraph in <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref> (Ecclesiastical History, 9:19). He evidently received his
               education, which included <ref rend="bold">medicine</ref>, in Alexandria, and he is
               regularly designated in the sources as ‘Archiatros (chief doctor) of <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref>’. Towards the end of his life he was sent by Ephrem, Patr. of
                  <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> (526/8–545) with a letter to Pope Agapetus; it was on
               the return from this journey that he died suddenly at Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>Sergios’s considerable literary output combined both original works, and numerous
               translations from Greek (a detailed list is given by Hugonnard-Roche, <hi rend="italic">La logique</hi>, 125–32). The translations fall into three
               categories:</p>
                    <p>1. Theological. The corpus of mystical writings attributed to <ref rend="bold">Dionysius the Areopagite</ref> (preserved in ms. Sinai Syr. 52, not yet edited
               apart from extracts). On the basis of a passage in <ref rend="bold">Yawsep
                  Ḥazzaya</ref>’s ‘Book of Questions’, Sergios seems also to have been the
               translator of the unexpurgated version of <ref rend="bold">Evagrius</ref>’s ‘Gnostic
               Chapters’ (ed. A. Guillaumont [PO 29.1; 1985]; see Guillaumont, <hi rend="italic">Les
                  ‘Kephalaia Gnostica’ d’Évagre le Pontique</hi> [1962], 215–27).</p>
                    <p>2. Medicine and astronomy. A considerable number of medical treatises by <ref rend="bold">Galen</ref> are enumerated in a famous letter by <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn
                  b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873) as having been the work of Sergios, but only a few of
               these survive (e.g. ed. E. Sachau, <hi rend="italic">Inedita Syriaca</hi> [1870],
               101–34; the second treatise there has recently been identified by G. Saliba, in <hi rend="italic">Byzantion</hi> 65 [1995], 443–4, as in fact being closely based on
               Paul of Alexandria).</p>
                    <p>3. Philosophy. Notably among these are the Pseudo-Aristotelian work, ‘On the
               Universe’, addressed to Alexander the Great (ed. de Lagarde, <hi rend="italic">Analecta Syriaca</hi> [1858], 134–58), and a treatise ‘On the causes of the
               Universe’ (unpublished) which has only recently been identified by D. Miller (in <hi rend="italic">SymSyr</hi> VI, 221–33) as a work by Alexander of Aphrodisias that
               is lost in Greek, and preserved elsewhere only in Arabic (ed. C. Genequand 2001). In
               an influential monograph of 1852 E. Renan (followed by <ref rend="bold">Baumstark</ref>), attributed a number of anonymous translations to Sergios,
               including those of <ref rend="bold">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Introduction’ to <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>’s logical works, and Aristotle’s ‘Categories’; these
               attributions, however, are now known to be definitely incorrect.</p>
                    <p>Sergios’s original writings which survive include: 1. a Treatise on the Spiritual
               Life (ed. P. Sherwood in <hi rend="italic">L’Orient Syrien</hi> 5 [1960], 433–59; 6
               [1961], 95–115, 121–156, with FT; IT by E. Vergani [2008]); this prefaces his
               translation of the Dionysian Corpus. It is already cited, though not by name, by <ref rend="bold">Gabriel Qaṭraya</ref> in his ‘Commentary on the Liturgy’; 2. a Treatise
               addressed to Philotheos, on Aristotle’s ‘Categories’ (unpublished; study and partial
               FT in Hugonnard-Roche, chap. 7); 3. a Treatise addressed to Theodore, ‘On the aim of
               all Aristotle’s writings’ (unedited; study and FT of Prologue and Book I by
               Hugonnard-Roche, chap. 8–9); 4. various Scholia on philosophical terms.</p>

                    <p>Collection of biblical commentaries (OT and NT) by Severos, a monk in the Monastery
               of St. Barbara near <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, who completed his work in 861.
               Severos compiled his work from existing commentaries and mentions as his main sources
                  <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (for the OT)
               and <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref> (for the NT). Between the extracts from
               these works there are a number of long insertions. One of them is a full commentary
               on the Octateuch by Yaʿqub of Edessa (Kruisheer). In another place a long extract
               from the Commentary on Isaiah by <ref rend="bold">Cyril of Alexandria</ref> was
               inserted (ter Haar Romeny, 155).</p>
                    <p>Severos’s work did not reach us in its original form, but in an expanded form, as it
               was written down a few decades later by the scribe Shemʿun of Ḥisn Manṣur (or Ḥesna
               d-Manṣur), who worked in the Monastery of the Seven Martyrs near Perrhe (Syr. <hi rend="italic">Parrin</hi>). Shemʿun not only copied Severos’s work in a
               three-volume ms. (Vat. Syr. 103, late 9th or 10th cent., cf. S. E. and
               J. S.  Assemani, <hi rend="italic">Bibliothecae Apostolicae Vaticanae …
                  Catalogus</hi>, I.3 [1759], 7–28), but also — as he himself tells us (f. 371r)  —
               added in the margins a number of notes and comments extracted from the works of such
               authors as Cyril of Alexandria, <ref rend="bold">Daniel of Ṣalaḥ</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Hippolytus</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Isidore</ref> (of Pelusium), <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> (many extract from his letters), <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub
                  of Serug</ref>, and from the <ref rend="bold">Book of Steps</ref>. Ms. Vat. Syr.
               103, which at an unknown date was brought to Egypt, was copied in the Monastery of
               the Mother of God in Gazarta, near Alexandria in (what is today) ms. Brit. Libr.
               Add. 12,144 (Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> II, 908a–914a), of which the
               initial part (113 folios, mainly from quires 2–12) remained in Egypt (presently ms.
                  <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref> Syr. 15). In this copy, the marginal comments
               were incorporated into the main text so that the work of Severos can no longer be
               distinguished from that of Shemʿun.</p>
                    <p>Ms. Vat. Syr. 103 left Dayr al-Suryān for Syria before 1646 and later came to <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>, where it was acquired for the Vatican Library by J. S.
               Assemani in 1716. <ref rend="bold">Buṭros Mubārak</ref> (Petrus Benedictus) edited
               several parts attributed to Ephrem in his Ephrem edition (1737–1740), but in the
               absence of any tools for the critical study of Ephrem, he was unable to address the
               question of authenticity and he, therefore, sometimes uncritically combined texts of
               dubious authenticity with genuine Ephrem materials (such as those preserved in ms.
               Vat. Syr. 110). It should also be noted that some of the materials included in
               Severus’s collection have their counterpart in an Armenian commentary attributed to
               Ephrem (see Mathews).</p>

                    <p>Patr. since 667/8. Severos was from Dayro da-Pgimto (see under <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref>). Prior to his election as patr. he was metropolitan bp. of <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>. His tenure as patr. is covered in the main historiographical
               works, in particular in <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref>. Severos is said to have been a severe man, who ruled harshly, and
               had the support of the Muslim Caliphs. A conflict arose with some metropolitan bps.
               about the right of ordination of suffragan bps. When Severos refused to leave that
               right to the metropolitan bps., the latter deposed and excommunicated him (in
               679/80). Severos responded with a counter-excommunication. This stale-mate lasted
               four years, until Severos, anticipating his death, sent a letter to the mafryono
               Yuḥanon Sobo (or Yuḥanon the Persian), in which he reiterated his rights and urged
               the bps. to repent. This letter is preserved, as part of a dossier of six letters
               related to the conflict, in Michael Rabo (XI.14: vol. 4, 438–44 [Syr.] and vol. 2,
               458–68 [FT])  — <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> is said to have copied two of
               these documents at the requests of the bps. These epistolary efforts indeed led to
               reconciliation which, however, was fully achieved only at a synod that met in
               Reshʿayna in the late summer of 684, after Severos had died earlier in the same
               year.</p>

               on the east bank of the Euphrates. We do not know much of Severos’s life. Some
               scholars assume that Severos was born at <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>. He became a
               monk and student in the Monastery of Qenneshre, the famous center of Greek learning
               founded by <ref rend="bold">John bar Aphtonia</ref>. According to the Maron. Chronicle
               Severos in his capacity as Bp. came in June 659 to <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>
               together with Bp. Theodore to hold a debate on religious matters with the Maronites
               in the presence of Muʿāwiyya. Several parts of his works survive, although only few
               have been published to date. Some of Severos’s astronomical works were (partially)
               published by F. Nau and E. Sachau. The most notable of these are: the ‘Treatise on
               the Astrolabe’ and the ‘Treatise on the Constellations’. Severos wrote several works
               concerning the logic of <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>, among which are his ‘Treatise
               on Syllogisms’ (written in 638) and his Letters to Bp. Aitalaha of Nineveh and the
               periodeutes Yawnan. According to the ms. tradition Severos translated from Middle
               Persian into Syriac a short exposition of Aristotle’s ‘De interpretatione’, which was
               composed by <ref rend="bold">Pawlos the Philosopher</ref> (6th cent.; also known as
               Pawlos the Persian). Some scholars suggested that Severos translated from Middle
               Persian into Syriac Pawlos’s compendium on the logic of Aristotle, which was
               addressed to the Persian shah Khusrau I (for the question of the language in which
               Pawlos wrote, see Pawlos the Philosopher).</p>

                    <p>Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, theologian, and prolific Greek author. Severus
               is generally recognized as the most important Greek theologian of the 6th cent., and
               he remains, along with <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos</ref>, the main authority on
               christology for the Syr. Orth. tradition. He originated from Sozopolis in Pisidia and
               came from a pagan family (the claim in the Life by <ref rend="bold">John bar
                  Aphtonia</ref> that his grandfather was a bp. is unfounded). He studied first in
               Alexandria and then at the Law school in <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref>. During his time
               in Beirut he was converted to Christianity and was baptised in the shrine of St.
               Leontius in Tripoli (488). He then adopted a monastic life near Gaza, but from 508–11
               he was in Constantinople, in support of the anti-Chalcedonian cause. When Flavian was
               deposed from the patriarchal see of Antioch in 512, Severus was elected as his
               successor. After the death of the emperor Anastasius (518), and with the new
               pro-Chalcedonian ecclesiastical policy of Justin I, he escaped to Egypt where he
               spent the rest of his life, apart from a brief visit to Constantinople in 536,
               summoned by Justinian. Back in Egypt, he died two years later (8 Feb. 538). On his
               return to Egypt in 536 the emperor had his writings (in Greek) condemned, with the
               result that most of them survive only in Syriac translations. The most important of
               these are the 125 ‘Cathedral’ Homilies, preached during his time on the patriarchal
               throne: these come down (not quite complete) in two forms, the earlier perhaps
               translated by <ref rend="bold">Pawlos of Kallinikos</ref>, and the later one as a
               careful revision, made by <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> over a century later.
               Only Homily 77 survives in the Greek original, thanks to its re-attribution to <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nyssa</ref> or to Hesychius of Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>Most of his other works are theological treatises refuting either Chalcedonian
               polemic (thus the Against the Grammarian [= John of Caesarea], the Discourses
               addressed to Nephalius, and the Philalethes), or the more extreme anti-Chalcedonians
               (thus the Correspondence with Sergios). There is also an extensive polemical work
               against <ref rend="bold">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref>, with whose views on
               incorruptibility of the flesh of Christ he disagreed. Severus was also a tireless
               letter writer, but only a very small proportion of his vast correspondence survives
               in Syriac translation. A collection of hymns (<hi rend="italic">maʿnyoto</hi>), often
               misleadingly referred to as the Oktoechos, includes several by him. Quite a number of
               excerpts on exegetical matters are preserved in Greek in certain of the Catenae
               collections.</p>
                    <p>A number of biographies of Severus survive; of these the two most important are those
               by John, abbot of the monastery of Beth Aphtonia (John bar Aphtonia), and <ref rend="bold">Zacharias Rhetor</ref> (his fellow student at Beirut). The latter
               (covering only up to 512) is a response to a pamphlet that had been put out claiming
               that Severus had taken part as a student in pagan rites.</p>

                  Nisibis</ref> to Mt. Qardu where the Ark of Noah rested, and there they built a
               church.</p>
                    <p>An earlier Armenian source, The Epic Histories, however, knows nothing of Shaliṭa’s
               connection to Mar Awgen or to Yaʿqub. Here, he is rather a disciple of the Syr. bp.
               Daniel, and he lived in the desert as an anchorite. After the death of the Armenian
               Patr. Nerses, he went to the Armenian district of Kordukʿ where he lived among lions
               and performed numerous miracles and healings. This source also attributes the story
               of the healing of a wounded lion’s paw, traditionally associated with Jerome, to Mar
               Shaliṭa.</p>
                    <p>No study has made any attempt to reconcile these divergent sources.</p>

                    <p>Sun worshipers who converted to the Syr. Orth. faith around the 6th cent., according
               to later testimonies. From the 14th cent. onward, they lived in and around <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>. They must have been looked
               upon with suspicion from the 14th until the 16th cent., for they resorted to
               obtaining at least eight bulls from various patriarchs and maph. testifying to their
               membership in the Syr. Orth. faith. The first testimony that survives is given by
               Patr. <ref rend="bold">Abrohom II Gharīb</ref> dated 25 July 1436, from which many
               later testimonies draw their text. The Shamsi followed the liturgical rites of the
               Syr. Orth., but had their own social traditions. Probably until the 19th  cent., they
               did not intermarry with others. They used to bury their dead with furniture and
               personal belongings, especially weapons, gold and silver, in their own cemeteries. In
               the mid-19th cent., they started marrying other Syr. Orth. There were around 70
               families of them in Amid and Mardin in the period of World War  I, and they had their
               own Church (Virgin Mary) in Mardin. A  few families survive in Syria, Lebanon,
               Turkey, and the US.</p>

                    <p>Scholar, probably active as a teacher in the theological school and perhaps also in
               the Christian medical teaching institute (<hi rend="italic">beth mardutā</hi>) of
                  <ref rend="bold">Beth Lapaṭ</ref> (Gondeshapur) in Khuzistan. In the Syriac
               tradition Ṣharbokht is known through the <ref rend="bold">Gannat Bussāme</ref>, an
               extensive commentary on the E.-Syr. lectionary. In this commentary Ṣharbokht is
               adduced more than 150 times in the exegesis of pericopes from the four Gospels, Acts,
               and Rom. However, the influence of Ṣharbokht’s exegesis in the <hi rend="italic">Gannat Bussāme</hi> many times exceeds these quotations, since the author of the
                  <hi rend="italic">Gannat Bussāme</hi> borrowed many long excerpts from Ṣharbokht’s
               commentaries without mentioning him by name. In the first quotation of Ṣharbokht in
               the <hi rend="italic">Gannat Bussāme</hi>he is introduced with his Christian name and
               the name of his father as ‘Ṣliba Zkha (‘the cross has overcome’), who is the priest
               and teacher Ṣharbokht, the son of Msargis’. The name of his father and some
               significant details of his exegesis make it very likely that Ṣharbokht bar Msargis
               may be identified with Ṣahārbūkht b. Māsarjīs, who according to the Arabic-Islamic
               tradition was the author of a commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Kunnāš</hi> (a
               medical handbook) written by a certain Jūrjīs (George). From the Arabic-Islamic
               tradition it can be inferred that Ṣahārbūkht b. Māsarjīs belonged to a family of
               physicians from Beth Lapaṭ (9th cent.). His son ‘Īsā is reported to have translated
               Hippocratic works from Syriac into Arabic. The important role which Greek medical
               knowledge — in particular Hippocratic and Galenic tradition — plays in Ṣharbokht’s
               exegesis seems to corroborate the assumption that Ṣharbokht bar Msargis and
               Ṣahārbūkht b. Māsarjīs are, in fact, one and the same person. Ṣharbokht’s biblical
               commentaries are typical representatives of exegetical compilations comparable to the
               biblical commentaries written by other scholars of the Ch. of E. in the 9th cent.,
               e.g. <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>. Ṣharbokht’s commentaries are a rich mine
               of information for older exegetical traditions which are no longer accessible today
               in the (lost) original works or in the other E.-Syr. exegetical compilations. The
               most remarkable and distinguishing characteristic of Ṣharbokht’s commentaries is the
               strong influence of medical knowledge. Theoretical <ref rend="bold">medicine</ref> has
               become in Ṣharbokht’s exegesis a veritable ancillary science for the explanation of
               the Scriptures. In this respect Ṣharbokht represents a unique example of the mutual
               influence of theological and profane learning in the 9th-cent. Christian milieu in
               Beth Lapaṭ, when E.-Syr. scholars from this city played a fundamental role in the
               transmission of among other things Greek medical knowledge to the Arabs in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>.</p>

               by Patr. Mīkhāʾīl Jarweh in 1786 for his nascent uniate church, naming it the
               ‘Monastery of Our Lady of Deliverance’ (<hi rend="italic">morath šuzobo</hi> = <hi rend="italic">sayyidat al-najāt</hi>). He then turned it into a patriarchal seat,
               and it remained so until 1852 when the seat was transferred to <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>. After the Genocide of World War I (see <ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref>),
               Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref> moved the patriarchate to Beirut,
               where Patr. <ref rend="bold">Gabriel Tappuni</ref> built an imposing residence in 1930
               in the al-Ashrafiyya quarter. In Sharfeh, Patr. Jarweh also founded a priestly
               institution: elementary seminary which corresponded to secondary school and an
               advanced seminary which offered courses in philosophy and theology. In 1950, Cardinal
               Gabriel Tappuni erected a new building for the two seminaries, including a beautiful
               church that stands between them. Several generations of ecclesiastics graduated from
               Sharfeh during one and a half centuries of its academic history, including the
               current Syr. Cath. Patr. Yawsep III Yonan before he studied theology in Rome.
               Priestly studies nowadays are pursued in Kaslik University, while the seminary serves
               as residence. Sharfeh is also the summer patriarchal seat and the home of the
               Ephremite monks as well. This order was founded in 1705 in Lebanon in the Monastery
               of St. Ephrem al-Ragham, and it moved to Mardin in 1881 to be eradicated by the
               Ottoman Turks in World War 1. It was reestablished in Sharfeh in 2000 by Cardinal
               Mūsā Dāʾūd, then patriarch of the Syr. Cath. Church. Sharfeh has a rich collection of
               Syriac manuscripts that have been catalogued more than once.</p>

                    <p>Patr. Eshai was consecrated as a boy of eleven after the death of his uncle Mar
               Shemʿon Pawlos. The consecration took place on 20 June 1920 at the Baʿqūba refugee
               camp near <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>. (In recent Church sources his birthday is
               usually given as 26 Feb. 1908, making him twelve at the time of his consecration.)
               After some schooling in England (1924–7) Mar Shemʿon returned to <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> and assumed the role of the Patr. as civil head of his people. He
               demanded that the League of Nations make special arrangements for the <ref rend="bold">Assyrians</ref> after the end of the British Mandate in Iraq in 1932, but this
               demand failed, and after confrontation with the new government he was deported with
               his family to Cyprus in 1933. In 1940 he went to the USA, settling first in <ref rend="bold">Chicago</ref> and later (1954) in San Francisco. In 1948 he at last let
               go of the idea of the ‘temporal power’ of the Patr. and began a policy of rebuilding
               the church in all the countries where its members were now dispersed. In 1964 he and
               Metropolitan Mar Yosip Ḥenanishoʿ issued a ‘synodical letter’ dictating, among other
               reforms, the adoption of the Gregorian calendar. This was resented especially by some
               in Iraq, and in 1968 a schism ensued under Mar <ref rend="bold">Toma Darmo</ref>. In
               1973 Mar Shemʿon married, an action which, though not strictly uncanonical, threw the
               church into confusion. Before his status could be settled, he was murdered in Nov.
               1975 by a disaffected nationalist. Eshai (Mar Shemʿon XXIII; but XXI in sources
               before 1940) was the last of the hereditary patriarchs of the Ch. of E.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> and martyr. Shemʿon was probably the
               immediate successor of <ref rend="bold">Papa bar ʿAggai</ref> (d. between 327 and 335),
               but nothing is known about his tenure as bp. prior to his arrest. His name ‘son of
               the dyers’ may refer to the profession of textile dying. Our main sources about
               Shemʿon are two interrelated Syriac texts: 1. the ‘Martyrdom of Shemʿon’ (first
               published by E. Assemani, <hi rend="italic">Acta sanctorum martyrum</hi> I [1748]);
               and 2. the longer ‘History of Shemʿon’ (first published by P. Bedjan, <hi rend="italic">Acta martyrum et sanctorum</hi> II [1891]). Both texts were
               published by M. Kmosko in 1907, who called them MS1 ‘Recensio antiquior’ and MS2
               ‘Recensio recentior’, respectively. Both texts are preserved in mss. that contain
               larger collections of E.-Syr. martyrdoms, which mostly are joined together with
               hagiographies and martyrdoms of the W.-Syr. tradition. One of the primary mss. for
               the ‘Martyrdom’, Vat. Syr. 160, is of disputed date (some parts of the ms. are from
               the 6th cent., but for this particular part Assemani proposed a 10th-cent. date,
               which seems too late); the other mss. are from the 9th cent. and later, belonging to
               either the E.-Syr. or the W.-Syr. tradition. <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>
               played an important role in the transmission of the texts, as mss. Vat. Syr. 160 and
               161 (the latter containing portions of both texts) were kept there, and ms. Brit.
               Libr. Add. 14,645 (which contains the ‘Martyrdom’) was written there in 932. Ms.
               Brit. Libr. Add. 12,174, an important witness of the ‘History’ was written in the
               time of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, at the expense of a deacon from <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref>. The ‘Martyrdom’, or a text closely related
               to it, was known to Sozomen, who incorporated some information on Shemʿon in his
               Ecclesiastical History (II.9–10), which was written ca. 445. Among the later sources,
               Shemʿon receives attention in the Arabic Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref> and
               ‘Book of the Tower’, as well as in <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s Chronicle (see
               Wiessner, 79–94). The E.-Syr. Breviary attributes to Shemʿon some hymns (ed. with LT
               Kmosko, 1048–55).</p>
                    <p>According to both Syriac texts, Shemʿon was arrested when he refused to comply with a
               royal order to raise a double tax from the Christian community. This happened
               probably in 340, when the Sasanian king Shapur II (309–379) was engaged in warfare
               with the Romans and the Persian Christians came under the suspicion of sympathizing
               with the Romans. In the introduction to the ‘Martyrdom’ the predicament of the
               Christians is compared with the oppression of the Jews in the time of the Maccabees,
               and the ‘two priests’, Judas (Maccabaeus) and Shemʿon, are portrayed as fighting for
               the same cause. Arrested in Seleucia, Shemʿon was transported to Karka d-Ledan, in
               Beth Huzaye, where he had several meetings with the king. A long subplot (in both
               Syr. texts and in Sozomen) concerns Shemʿon’s encounter with the defector Gushtazad,
               who upon seeing Shemʿon decided to return to his Christian faith and became a martyr
               even before Shemʿon. After having been given ample opportunity to rescind his
               position and to pay homage to the king and his gods, Shemʿon is executed. While the
               ‘History’, to a certain extent, expands on the ‘Martyrdom’, Wiessner has argued
               convincingly that the author of the ‘History’ had access to additional sources and in
               some cases deliberately updated the ‘Martyrdom’ theologically and ideologically. For
               both the ‘Martyrdom’ and the ‘History’ the question arises as to what extent they may
               be used as historical sources, a question that becomes even more pertinent if one
               takes into consideration that there were several decades between the events that are
               reported and the redaction of the texts. The final redaction probably took place in
               the early 5th cent., or — in the case of the ‘History’ — well into the 5th cent.</p>
                    <p>Several other martyr texts deal with the persecution under Shapur II. Among the texts
               that are most closely related to the Shemʿon texts are the Martyrdom of Tarbo,
               Shemʿon’s sister (ed. Bedjan, <hi rend="italic">AMS</hi> 2, 254–60) and the Martyrdom
               of Pusay (or Pusayk) and Marta (ibid., 208–32 and 233–41).</p>

               questions and answers, the law book consists of 22  chapters and begins with some
               reflections on the sources of Christian law, for which the author gives priority to
               the tradition of the Fathers. This law book, in its Syriac version, became
               authoritative in the juridical tradition of the Ch. of E. It is included in the
               important ms. Alqosh Syr. 169, the primary source for the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon
                  Orientale</ref>.</p>
                    <p>The translator, in his introduction, refers to Shemʿon, the author of the Persian
               work, as ‘priest and teacher’ and metropolitan bp. of Rev Ardashir. This raises the
               important question of whether this Shemʿon is the same person as metropolitan <ref rend="bold">Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir</ref> who was one of the protagonists in the
               rebellion against Cath. <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III</ref> (649–59), a rebellion that
               spread to the bishops of Beth Qaṭraye. Unfortunately the law book cannot be dated
               with precision. While there is obviously some connection between Shemʿon’s law book
               and that of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿbokht of Rev Ardashir</ref> (whose dates are also
               somewhat disputed, but who belongs to the 8th cent.), it remains unclear which one of
               the two preceded the other. Sachau thought that Ishoʿbokht preceded Shemʿon and that
               the author of the law book should be distinguished from the rebellious bishop
               (xix-xx). Other scholars, however, leave the question open (e.g. Dauvillier and more
               recently Brock), even though Shemʿon’s law book is usually discussed before that of
               Ishoʿbokht (which is also the sequence in ms. Alqosh Syr. 169). Whether the two
               metropolitans by the name of Shemʿon are one and the same person must, therefore,
               also remain undecided.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Author, teacher of <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref> (for Shemʿon’s name, which
               refers to the village of Shaqlāwa [or Shanqlabad], near <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref>,
               see G. Hoffmann, <hi rend="italic">Auszüge aus syrischen Akten persischer
                  Märtyrer</hi> [1880], 231–3). No information about Shemʿon’s life is available,
               but some of his works are preserved. The first is called ‘Chronicon’ and is a
               treatise on chronology and on the calendar, in the form of questions and answers, for
               the use of his disciple Bar Zoʿbi. He requested the work from Shemʿon, because he and
               his companions did not have access to the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref>
               and so were often at a loss when they found references to Eusebius in the works of
               earlier authors. In addition to being a general introduction to chronology, the work
               also deals with the Christian holidays. It is preserved in some mss. in Western
               libraries, e.g. Brit. Libr. Add. 25,875, dated 1709 (Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi>, vol. 3, 1067b–68b) and Berlin 102 (Sachau, 108), perhaps 16th
               cent. (cf. E.  Sachau, <hi rend="italic">Verzeichniss der syrischen
                  Handschriften</hi>, 357–59), but apart from extracts (in Müller), it has remained
               unedited.</p>
                    <p>Another work by Shemʿon is a mystical poem of moralizing content (ed. Cardahi). It is
               transmitted in ms. Vat. Syr. 187, along with a commentary by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ
                  bar Brikha</ref> (see S. E. and J. S. Assemani, <hi rend="italic">Bibliothecae
                  Apostolicae Vaticanae … Catalogus</hi>, I.3 [1759], 404–5). Probably from a
               different work is a small collection of ‘sayings’ attributed to Shemʿon, preserved in
               ms. Alqosh 291 (cf. J.  Vosté, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue de la Bibliothèque
                  syro-chaldéenne du Couvent de Notre-Dame des Semences</hi> [1929], 107, no. 10).
               Finally, Shemʿon may also be the author of a treatise on the Eucharist and Baptism,
               preserved in the same Brit. Libr. ms. that has the ‘Chronicon’ (Add. 25,875).</p>

                <ab type="infobox">(late 7th cent.) [Ch. of E.]</ab>
                <div type="body">
                    <p>One of the bright representatives of E.-Syr. mysticism. Nothing is known of his life,
               except that he was a renowned physician at the time of Cath. <ref rend="bold">Ḥenanishoʿ I</ref> (685/6–692/3); he was also known as Luqa, while in the ms.
               tradition he is referred to as ‘a disciple of Rabban Shabur’ (middle of the 7th
               cent.), which implies either that he was his direct disciple or that he resided in
               the monastery of Rabban Shabur (modern southwest Iran). <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar
                  Brikha</ref> attributes to him three books: on the monastic life; on medicine; and
               on the interpretation of the mysteries of the cell. Whereas the first and the third
               title seem to correspond to the extant ‘Book of Grace’ (attributed in the W.-Syr. ms.
               tradition to <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Nineveh</ref>; for the list of mss., see Vööbus)
               and the <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> ‘On the consecration of the cell’ (ms. olim
               Alqosh, Notre-Dame des Semences; Vosté 237 and its later copies), respectively, his
               medical work is known only from the quotations in the Lexicon of <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  Bahlul</ref>. ʿAbdishoʿ’s list is to be supplemented by a group of short fragments
               of unidentified provenance preserved in the aforementioned Alqosh ms. as well as by
               sentences of mystical content (ms. Sharfeh, Rahmani 80, and the lost ms. <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref> 109). Moreover, <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref> attributes to
               him a life of Mar Gani, which seems to be lost. His mystical works were used both by
               E.-Syr. (e.g. <ref rend="bold">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref>) and W.-Syr. authors (e.g. <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>).</p>
                    <p>The probable explanation of the name of Shemʿon d-Ṭaybutheh (lit. ‘of his grace’) is
               that it derives from the title of his book, viz. the ‘Book of Grace’. The history of
               scholarship on this text and its authenticity proceeded from the acceptance of the
               authorship of Isḥaq based predominantly on the data provided by mss. (Vööbus, Bunge)
               to the critical investigation of a wider scope which resulted in the plausibility of
               the attribution to Shemʿon with acknowledgment of strong influence of Isḥaq’s
               writings upon Shemʿon (Miller, Bettiolo). The comparative study of the ‘Book of
               Grace’ in the context of the extant works of Isḥaq and Shemʿon as well as of the
               interrelationship of the ms. tradition of their works still remains a
               desideratum.</p>
                    <p>Although Shemʿon evidently draws on the authoritative writings of <ref rend="bold">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Mark the Monk</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</ref>, Makarios, etc., it is not yet clear how he
               interpreted the tradition, while developing original doctrine with emphasis on the
               role of the divine grace in the life of the monk and special attention to the issue
               of interdependence between the body and the spiritual life.</p>

                    <p>Writer, maph. of <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref> (1710–40), and martyr. He was born
               in Beth Manʿem ca. 1670 to Malke b. Ayyub and Saydeh. He became a monk ca. 1690 and
               visited <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> in 1695. Shortly after, he was
               ordained a priest and became a <hi rend="italic">ḥbišoyo</hi> ‘recluse’ at Dayro
               d-Mor Yaʿqub near <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>. He was consecrated maph. for
               Ṭur ʿAbdin in 1710 by Patr. <ref rend="bold">Isḥoq ʿAzar</ref> at the church of Mor
               Thoma in Qaṭrabil near <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>. The following year, however,
               Shemʿun temporarily retired from the responsibilities of the maphrianate without
               abdicating, preferring the life of a <hi rend="italic">ḥbišoyo</hi> at Dayro d-Mor
               Yaʿqub. In 1725, he brought about a reconciliation between the Patriarchate of Ṭur
               ʿAbdin, upon the death of its Patr. Ignatius Denḥo, with the mainstream Patriarchate
               in <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>, a union which lasted for 15 years. He returned to
               actively administer the maphrianate in 1727.</p>
                    <p>Shemʿun was tortured then killed on 6 Apr. 1740 by ʿAbdal Agha, a local Kurdish
               warlord, for refusing to grant a matrimonial permission for the Agha’s Syr. Orth.
               servant who wished to marry a close cousin, an act prohibited by the canon law of the
               time. Shemʿun is particularly known for a Kurdish song, <hi rend="italic">Lawij</hi>
               ‘lyrical song’, which he is said to have recited during an audience with the Kurdish
               Amir of Jazireh, Muḥammad al-Bakhti, during the time when ʿAbdal Agha was trying to
               get Shemʿun killed.</p>
                    <p>His literary works include: 1. A book on religion and theology (ms. Syr. Orth. Patr.

                    <p>Polemical writer and bp. The main source for Shemʿun’s life is a much romanticized
               and not very informative chapter in <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>’s ‘Lives
               of the Eastern Saints’ (ed. Brooks; see Harvey, 97–98). Shemʿun was of Persian
               origin. There is no evidence that he ever studied at the <ref rend="bold">School of
                  Edessa</ref>, even though the School is an important target in his invective.
               While Yuḥanon presents Shemʿun as bp. (and is followed in this by the later
               tradition), Beth Arsham, said to be near <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref>, is
               not otherwise known as an episcopal see, which led Fiey to suggest that Shemʿun was
               an itinerant bp. and that Beth Arsham was his native town, rather than his diocese
               (Fiey, 126).</p>
                    <p>From ca. 500 Shemʿun was active in opposing the spread of dyophysitism in Armenia
               (where he attended a synod in 505/06; see Garsoïan, 186), in Persia, and in the
               Byzantine Empire. As a ‘brave warrior on behalf of the true faith’ (Yuḥanon of
               Ephesus), he often engaged in public debates of high visibility, by which he gained
               the title ‘Persian debater’ (<hi rend="italic">dorušo parsoyo</hi>). At an old age he
               went to Constantinople, where he met with Yuḥanon of Ephesus and where Empress <ref rend="bold">Theodora</ref> (d. 548) paid homage to him, before he died there,
               probably in the early 540s.</p>
                    <p>Among Shemʿun’s writings Yuḥanon of Ephesus mentions ‘refutations against heretics’
               and ‘many letters on the faith, to many believers everywhere’. Two letters, perhaps
               three, are preserved. The first is ‘On <ref rend="bold">Barṣawma</ref> bp. of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> and the heresy of the Nestorians’ (ed. Assemani with LT;
               FT in Garsoïan, 450–56; ET in Becker); its specific historical context and date are
               not known, but it most likely was written during the reign of the Roman Emperor
               Anastasius (491–518). After having traced the genealogy of (what he saw as)
               Nestorianism from the Jews in Jesus’ day to Paul of Samosata, <ref rend="bold">Diodore
                  of Tarsus</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Hiba
                  </ref>of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, and the School of the Persians, he
               forcefully denounces leaders and scholars of the School, in particular <ref rend="bold">Aqaq</ref>, Barṣawma of Nisibis, and <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>. To these he
               opposes those who remained faithful to the true faith and rejected Nestorianism and
               any mention of ‘two Sons, one by nature and one by adoption’. The second letter deals
               with the persecution of Christians in the city of <ref rend="bold">Nagran</ref> (the
               date of which is disputed: either 518 or 523). Shemʿun’s letter was written from <ref rend="bold">Ḥirta</ref> in 524 (ed. Guidi). Although it focuses on the events of the
               persecution, it also contains polemical notes against both Nestorians and
               Chalcedonians. I. Shahîd, who discovered and edited a different letter on the same
               topic, argued for Shemʿun’s authorship of this new letter as well (which is
               anonymous). In addition, he suggested that Shemʿun is also the author of ‘Book of the
               Ḥimyarites’ (see <ref rend="bold">Ḥimyar</ref>), which is only fragmentarily known (ed.
               A. Moberg) and which deals with the same persecution. These two attributions,
               however, have not been widely accepted.</p>

                    <p>Saint. Born in the village of Sisa near Nicopolis, Shemʿun was the child of Christian
               parents. Uninstructed in the faith, he happened to enter a church, and thereafter
               sought God. First he lived with some ascetics near his village, and then spent 10
               years in the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Tell ʿAda</ref> before being asked to leave
               because of his extreme ascetic practices. He traveled to Telneshe, where he spent 3
               years on a nearby summit in a small domed hut before standing in the open air within
               a circle of stones. Later, he mounted the first of several increasingly higher
               pillars till he reached a height of around 20 meters. Here he took his stance of
               continual prayer. For 47 years he prayed and prostrated, adjudicated and advised,
               healed and harmed. His fame reached from the Persian Empire to Britain, and pilgrims
               flocked to his pillar from all levels of society. His novel asceticism of standing on
               a pillar aroused criticism, but was later imitated. Shemʿun attempted to persuade
                  <ref rend="bold">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref> to accept the Formula of Reunion of 433
               between bishops John of Antioch and <ref rend="bold">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>. On his
               death, his body was brought with great pomp to <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> and
               buried there. His life is known through the works of three writers: Theodoret of
               Cyrrhus devoted to Shemʿun a chapter of his ‘History of the Monks of Syria’, written
               in 444 before the death of Shemʿun; a life written in Syriac and extant in 3 mss.
               (ms. Vat. Syr. 160, ed. S. E. Assemani, <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum et
                  Martyrum</hi>, vol. II [1748], 230–398; ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 14,484, ed. Bedjan,
                  <hi rend="italic">AMS</hi>, vol. IV, 507–644; Dam. Patr. 12/17) seems to stem from
               the monastic community which grew up around Shemʿun’s pillar and would have been
               written in the last half of the 5th cent.; finally, a life in Greek claiming to have
               been written by his intimate disciple, Antonius. The three lives give basically the
               same description of Shemʿun’s life till his stance on the pillar and of the
               circumstances surrounding his death, but there are almost no narratives in common for
               the time he spent on the pillar. In what appears to be a genuine letter to bp. Basil
               of Antioch, Shemʿun accepts the Council of Chalcedon, though 3 letters ascribed to
               him are anti-Chalcedon. His feast day is 27 July for the Syr. Church, 1 Sept. for the
               Greek Church.</p>

                    <p>Bp. and writer. Shlemon was the metropolitan bp. of Prat d-Mayshan, or Baṣra, on the
               banks of the Shatt al-Arab in southern Iraq. He was originally from the town of
               Akhlat, located on the northwest coast of Lake Van. Little is known about his life
               except that he was in attendance at the consecration of the Ch. of E. Cath. Sabrishoʿ
               in 1222 (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, 3.1.453). <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ
                  bar Brikha</ref> lists a number of Shlemon’s literary works in his ‘Catalogue’,
               including prayers, treatises, a discourse on heaven and earth, and the ‘Book of the
               Bee’ (<hi rend="italic">ktābā d-debboritā</hi>) (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, 3.1.309). The ‘Book of the Bee’ is by far Shlemon’s best known work.
               Its purpose is to explain the work of divine dispensation in the history of the
               world, from Creation to the Resurrection. In this work, Shlemon gleans ideas and
               excerpts from a wide variety of writings. Hence, the title draws upon the
               illustration of a bee gathering (<hi rend="italic">lqṭ</hi>) nectar from multiple
               flowers.</p>

               known bp. of that see for the Sasanian period, he was a contemporary of <ref rend="bold">Grigor I</ref>, Cath. 605–ca. 609, of the monastic reformer and
               theologian <ref rend="bold">Babai the Great</ref>, and of the biblical commentator <ref rend="bold">Barḥadbshabba</ref>. He was noted among his ascetical and literary
               contemporaries for his virtue of life and for his writings, and his name is included
               in the lists of ascetical writers in Mesopotamia catalogued by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref> of Baṣra.</p>
                    <p>Shubḥalmaran was one of a group, including the monk Mar<ref rend="bold"/>Gewargi of
               Izla, who in 612 successfully urged on the monarch Khusrau the Victorious (r.
               590–628) the rightness of the ‘orthodox’ (i.e. E.-Syr.) cause, though without
               persuading him to restore the Catholicate, suspended after the death of Grigor I.
               However, he failed in his attempts to thwart the schemes of Gabriel of Shingar, the
               court physician, to appropriate church property. Gabriel’s vengeful intrigues to pay
               off old scores on this and other accounts, moral and theological, resulted in his
               lifetime exile and the martyrdom of Gewargi as a convert from Mazdaism.</p>
                    <p>A collection of Shubḥalmaran’s writings on ascetic life and on the end times are
               preserved with others by <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Nathpar</ref> and Barḥadbshabba in
               the 9th-cent. ms. Brit. Libr. Or. 6714. One folio is found in ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat.
               Ar. 6725, and another in ms. Birmingham, Mingana Syr. 631. Quotations from his
               exegetical works are to be found in Sabrishoʿ bar Pawlos.</p>
                    <p>The folios in the Brit. Libr. ms. do not provide one single work, ‘The Book of
               Gifts’, but a collection of pieces on the themes of self-denial and spiritual combat.
               Fols. 1–30r present ‘The Book of Gifts’ and describe 15 virtues (gifts) which
               cumulatively form the crowning virtue of Love. Fols. 30r–41v contain 13 ‘Chapters
               concerning wise admonitions’; Fols. 41v–54r give 22 ‘More warnings and admonitions’
               set out alphabetically; Fols. 54r–60r contain ‘Further chapters ... for brethren to
               live in accord’; Fols. 60r–62r contain ‘Revelations about the assembly of believers’.
               Fol. 62r-v provide ‘Dark sayings of our Lord and Paul about the last time’, and Fols.
               62v–73r ‘Revelations about the last time’. The texts on ff. 60r–73r are also to be
               found in Sinai, New Finds, Syr. M20N.</p>
                    <p>Shubḥalmaran provides his letters (e.g. on reluctance to be an ascetic), portraits of
               virtue (e.g. voluntary renunciation and humility), and precepts or canons (e.g. for
               communal sleeping arrangements and for solitary household management) in response to
               the problems brought by these expressions of asceticism: he does not write for the
               pure solitaries. His writings are characterised by a large use of scripture, quoted
               directly or allusively, and a sharp turn of phrase to express spiritual and social
               perspicacity. In Syriac <ref rend="bold">monasticism</ref> he stands at a stage when
               pragmatic use of scripture and good sense shaped ascetic life, rather than
               speculative and philosophical concepts. These came with the influence of the
               philosopher monk <ref rend="bold">Evagrius</ref> and his Syriac adaptors. These, e.g.
                  <ref rend="bold">Yawsep Ḥazzaya</ref>, patterned the kinds of ascetic life into a
               progression which matched stages between the created and the uncreated order:
               Shubḥalmaran is closer to <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, and fits into the context of
               the traditional monasticism of his contemporaries associated with the Monastery at
               Mt. Izla.</p>

                    <p>A city in eastern Turkey, southwest of Lake Van. During the late Ottoman period, it
               was part of the Vilayet of Bitlis, adjacent to the Vilayet of Diar-Bakir (see <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>) located to its northeast. Kurds made up more than half of
               the entire population, which also included a large portion of Christian families,
               namely Armenian, Syr. Orth., E. Syr., and Chald., in addition to small numbers of
               Syr. Catholics and Protestants. Siirt is made famous by the Chronicle of Siirt, an
               early 11th cent. Christian Arabic source published by <ref rend="bold">Addai
                  Scher</ref>, bp. of the city. The anonymous Chronicle is missing its first folios,
               and in its actual condition, covers the ecclesiastical history from the middle of the
               3rd cent., time of the Roman emperor Gallus, to the middle of the 7th cent., time of
               the monastic writer <ref rend="bold">Sahdona</ref>. Siirt was the seat of a Chald. bp.
               from 1553, and the list of bishops from this time to 1915 can be reconstructed. The
               last bp. of Siirt was Addai Scher, a prolific writer and critical scholar who was
               murdered and mutilated near Siirt on 15 June 1915. All the Christians of the city and
               region without exception fell victim to the massacres that were perpetrated against
               them at the beginning of World War I, in such a way that Christianity was wiped out
               in the city after 1925. It is said that before Bp. Scher died, he hid his collection
               of books and mss. in a dry well, wrapped to be protected from humidity, but the well
               cannot be now located.</p>

               recension of <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Koni</ref>’s ‘Scholion’, as well as of some
               of the additional passages in the body of that recension. The first collection of
               questions and answers, in 20 sections and bearing the heading ‘matters (<hi rend="italic">šarbe</hi>) [taken] from the books of non-Christian authors (<hi rend="italic">barrāye</hi>) and philosophers, collected by Mar Silwanos, bishop of
               Qardu’, deals with such subjects as atheism, astrology, determinism, dualism, the
               problem of evil, angelology, and superstitious practices. The second collection, with
               44 questions, deals with philosophy in general and with the subject matters of <ref rend="bold">Porphyry</ref>’s ‘Eisagoge’ and <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>’s
               ‘Categories’ and ‘On interpretation’. A significant part of the materials in the

               passages found there also reappear in the lexicon of <ref rend="bold">Bar Bahlul</ref>.
               This Silwanos is no doubt to be dated after Theodoros bar Koni and is therefore to be
               distinguished from ‘Silwanos, bp. of Qardu’ who is said to have visited Rabban

               Late Sasanian Empire (Perry), though others have considered that it is of Indian
               origin. The work (to be distinguished from the tales of Sindbad the Sailor) proved to
               be very popular and was translated into many different languages, eastern and
               western, the latter via Hebrew (Sendebar, ed. M. Epstein, 1967) and Spanish (the
               European versions often go under the title ‘The 7 Sages of Rome’). All versions
               ultimately go back to a lost Middle Persian text by way of Arabic. The Syriac version
               is the earliest extant witness, having been translated from a lost Arabic
               intermediary (ca. 9th cent.); in the 11th cent. the Syriac was in turn translated
               into Greek in <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref> by Michael Andreopoulos (who rendered the

                    <p>The Legend tells about seven (in Syriac most often eight) young Christian men who
               during the period of the persecution of the Christians by the Roman emperor Decius
               (249–251) refused to offer sacrifice to pagan gods, and taking advantage of the
               emperor’s temporary absence from Ephesus, escaped to the mountains outside the city,
               where they hid in a cave and fell asleep. Having returned, the emperor gave orders to
               wall up the cave so that the young men would die buried alive. However, 195 years
               later, in the 38th year of the reign of the Christian emperor Theodosius II
               (401–450), i.e. 445/6, they woke up, and since the wall had been removed they left
               the cave, convinced that they had slept just one night. When one of them, whom they
               had sent to the city, tried to pay for food with the coins from the epoch of Decius,
               the shopkeeper thought that they had found a hoard of old money. The bp. of the city,
               however, having investigated the matter, understood that a great miracle had
               happened. The young men then fell asleep again, this time for good. There is also the
               mention of the heresy, that became known in the same period, of Theodore bp. of
               Aegae, who denied the bodily resurrection of the dead. The Sleepers of Ephesus’s
               awakening ‘proved’ that Theodore was wrong, thus giving a clue to the function of the
               Legend.</p>
                    <p>In Ephesus soon the cult of the Sleepers of Ephesus developed, and a church devoted
               to them, as a pilgrim’s narrative attests (Theodosius the Archdeacon, ‘De situ terrae
               sanctae’, between 518 and 530), was built there (it was discovered by the German
               archeological expedition in the 1930s).</p>
                    <p>The Legend of theSleepers of Ephesus develops the old topic of a long sleep, which
               can be found already in the ‘Rest of the Words of Jeremiah’, 5:1 (2nd cent. AD) where
               Abimelek the ‘Ethiopian’ (i.e. African) falls asleep for the period of the Babylonian
               exile of the Jews, a topic also known from the Babylonian Talmud (Taʿanit23; 2nd
               cent. AD), where it is told that one Honi Ha-Meʿaggel slept for the same period.</p>
                    <p>The Legend was originally, as it seems, composed in Greek. It soon became quite
               popular, and was translated into a number of languages: Latin (first attested by
               Gregory of Tours, 538–594) and from this into West European vernaculars, including
               French (poem by Chardri, 13th cent.), and in Eastern Christianity into Syriac,
               Armenian, Coptic, Arabic, Ethiopic, and <ref rend="bold">Sogdian</ref>. It is also
               known in the sphere of Islam, as it appears in the Qurʾān(18:8–30). Consequently
               there came into being several Muslim versions, including those in languages such as
               Persian, Kyrgyz, and Tatar. The existence of all these versions stimulated the
               popular cult of the Sleepers of Ephesus in several places in addition to Ephesus,
               both in the Latin West and in the Muslim East.</p>
                    <p>In Syriac the Legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus is perhaps first attested by the ms.
               Saint-Petersburg no. 4 of the 5th cent., if M. van Esbroeck’s dating is accepted, and
               then by <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>, who devoted to it a <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi>, written at the beginning of the 6th cent. (ed. Guidi, ‘Testi
               orientali’, two versions, 358–63, 363–9). This includes all the elements known from
               the later prose texts. Still in the 6th cent. it found its way into historiographic
               works such as the Ecclesiastical History of <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>of
               Mitylene (d. after 569), from whom <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> has a fragment
               in his Chronicle (ca. 1198), and <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>’s
               Ecclesiastical History (not extant, but copied by Pseudo-Dionysios of Tel Maḥre, in
               the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>, ca. 775). There is, however, also an
               independent transmission, as for instance, in the mss. of London, Paris, and Berlin,
               edited by I. Guidi (1884) and A. Allgeier (1916–18). The earliest of them (if not
               Peterburgensis) would be London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,650, of the 6th–7th cent. There
               are some differences between the Syriac witnesses, one of them being the number of
               the young martyrs: seven in the oldest witnesses (Yaʿqub of Serugh and
               Pseudo-Zacharias) and in Michael Rabo, but eight in all the other texts.</p>
                    <p>The original language of the text was the object of a discussion for several years.
               Some scholars (including Th. Nöldeke 1886, 453–54) believed that the original was
               composed in Syriac. This was also the opinion of Allgeier (1916–18). His claim was
               criticised by Paul Peeters (1923), who showed that the original must have been
               Greek.</p>
                    <p>As mentioned above, the Legend of the Sleepers of Ephesus was also known in the West
               in the Middle Ages, appearing for the first time in Gregory of Tours’s <hi rend="italic">(Liber) In Gloria martyrum</hi>, ch. 38 (ed. B. Krusch [Monumenta
               Germaniae Historica, IV/A; 1885], 94), where he says that he had it from ‘a certain
               Syrian translator’ (<hi rend="italic">Syro quidam interpretante</hi>). Although the
               presence of the Syrians in Gaul in the epoch is documented, it is not certain that
               Gregory really heard the Legend from a Syrian, as the term <hi rend="italic">Syrus</hi> was applied in the epoch to all the foreigners of Levantine origin,
               including Greek-speaking ones, and therefore his version was most probably derived
               from a Greek text (Peeters, 141–2).</p>
                    <p>The feast of the Sleepers of Ephesus is not fixed and according to various calendars
               of the Syr. Orth. Church it is celebrated on 21 April, 2 and 13 August, and 23 or 24
               October (ed. F. Nau, <hi rend="italic">Un martyrologe et douze ménologes

                    <p>Independent self-taught scholars. These twin sisters were born on 16 April 1843 at
               Irvine, Ayrshire. Both were widowed early on in their marriages, and devoted much of
               the rest of their lives to scholarship. They wrote under their married names, A. S.
               Lewis and M. D. Gibson. Agnes was concerned primarily with Syriac, publishing many
               new texts in the series Studia Sinaitica (1–12; 1894–1907), while Margaret
               concentrated more on Christian Arabic texts, which she published in Horae Semiticae
               (1–11; 1903–16), though she also edited and translated the <ref rend="bold">Didascalia</ref> (1903) and <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>’s Commentaries
               on the Gospels and Acts. Thus Agnes provided the Catalogue of the Syriac mss. at <ref rend="bold">St. Catherine’s Monastery</ref> (1894), and Margaret that for the Arabic
               ones (1894). (Impressed by their knowledge of Modern Greek, the Librarian gave them
               access to the mss.) Among Agnes’ important editions are <hi rend="italic">Select
                  Narratives of Holy Women</hi> (1900), representing the upper text of the
               ‘Sinaiticus’ ms. of the <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac Version</ref>of the Gospels, <hi rend="italic">Apocrypha Syriaca</hi> (1902), and several <ref rend="bold">Christian
                  Palestinian Aramaic</ref> texts, both biblical and hagiographical. Together the
               two sisters edited the Palestinian Syriac Lectionary (1899) and a collection of
               Christian Palestinian Aramaic palimpsest fragments from Geniza mss. (1900). The mss.
               they acquired in Cairo were left to Westminster College, Cambridge.</p>

                    <p>First Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>. Little is known about his life. While
               he was bp. of Ṣalaḥ under the honorific name Baselios, Patr. Ishmaʿil (d. 1365)
               hastily excommunicated him. Sobo traveled to <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref>,
               to seek reconciliation with the Patr., but the latter refused to receive him. Sobo
               made a second attempt, this time accompanied by a delegation of bishops, priests, and
               notables from Ṭur ʿAbdin, but the Patr. even refused to admit them to the monastery.
               After a wait of four days outside the doors of the monastery, the delegation left
               angrily shouting in defiance, ‘oksios, oksios, oksios to Patr. Mor Sobo.’ They went
               to Dayro d-Mor Yaʿqub of Ṣalaḥ and installed Sobo Patr. of Ṭur ʿAbdin. Sobo received
               a diploma confirming his Patriarchate from the Ayyubid ruler of Ḥesno d-Kifo dated 6
               Aug. 1364.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>The Sogdian language belongs to the Eastern subgroup of the Iranian languages. Its
               core area was Central Asia, in the region surrounding Samarqand and Bukhara, where it
               was native to the bulk of the population throughout the first millennium AD. For many
               centuries, Sogdian merchants controlled the central part of the Silk Road and
               extended their influence far beyond the area of their original habitation. Numerous
               Buddhist, Manichean, and Christian texts in Sogdian illustrate the religious
               diversity in Central Asia and western <ref rend="bold">China</ref> in the period before
               the Islamization of the area.</p>
                    <p>The absolute majority of all Christian texts known to us in Sogdian transmission
               stems from the ruins of a Christian monastery at Bulayıq in the Silk Road oasis of
                  <ref rend="bold">Turfan</ref> (now in Xinjiang, China). Found <hi rend="italic">in
                  situ</hi> by the Second German Turfan Expedition in 1905, they are now kept in
               Berlin as part of the German Turfan Collection. These texts are written in a variety
               of the Syriac Esṭrangela script, with the addition of three supplementary letters for
               the phonemes /f/, /χ/, and /ʒ/. This writing system was not used for recording
               Buddhist or Manichean texts, and therefore it is usually referred to as the Christian
               Sogdian script. Its orthography reflects quite faithfully the phonetic structure of
               Late Sogdian and does not display the archaizing features of other Sogdian scripts.
               The bulk of the available Christian Sogdian manuscripts appear to have been written
               in the 9th and 10th cent., when Sogdian was likely the lingua franca of the Bulayıq
               Christian community.</p>
                    <p>The content of the Bulayıq library indicates that Sogdian Christians belonged to the
               Ch. of E., which is otherwise known for its missionary activity along the Silk Road.
               Besides non-denominational compositions, such as Gospel readings, psalms, and lives
               of early saints, one finds there numerous texts that are particular to Syriac
               Christianity, such as the life of <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan of Dailam</ref>, a verse
               homily ‘On the final evil hour’ by <ref rend="bold">Babai of Nisibis</ref>, or <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ</ref>’s Commentaries on <ref rend="bold">Isaiah of Scetis</ref>.
               There is no evidence for indigenous Sogdian Christian literature, while all the
               identified texts of foreign origin appear, with one exception, to have been
               translated from Syriac. A large number of Syriac manuscripts have, in fact, been
               excavated at Bulayıq (see <ref rend="bold">Syriac texts from Turfan</ref>), among which
               are some Sogdian and Syriac bilinguals. In addition, the same site yielded a smaller
               number of Old Turkic manuscripts, presumably from its terminal phase, and isolated
               texts in Middle and New Persian. The preparation of the catalogue of texts found at
               Bulayıq constitutes the main objective of a current SOAS research project <hi rend="italic">The Christian Library from Turfan</hi>.</p>
                    <p>There is no doubt that Bulayıq Sogdian was mutually intelligible with the other known
               varieties of the Sogdian language. Its peculiar feature, however, is a large number
               of technical terms of Syriac origin, e.g. <hi rend="italic">ksʾ</hi> ‘chalice’, <hi rend="italic">mdbḥʾ</hi> ‘altar’, <hi rend="italic">šmšʾ</hi> ‘deacon’. The Syriac
               nouns are normally borrowed in the emphatic state and then inflected as Sogdian <hi rend="italic">ā</hi>-stems. By contrast, Buddhist or Manichean Sogdian
               compositions do not contain any common nouns of undisputed Syriac origin.</p>
                    <p>No Sogdian texts of Christian content are available from the Sogdian heartland,
               although Syriac inscriptions are found in the Sogdian archaeological contexts in
               Urgut (Uzbekistan) and Panjakent (Tajikistan). One Sogdian inscription with Syriac
               loanwords is found in Kyrgyzstan. The Sogdian finds from the ‘Caves of the Thousand
               Buddhas’ in the Silk Road Oasis of Dunhuang include a small fragment of a Christian
               oracle book and several secular texts mentioning local Christians.</p>

                    <p>The Odes of Solomon consist of 42 short lyric poems, of which the Syriac version is
               preserved almost complete, while Ode 11 is also known in Greek, and five Odes in
               Coptic (including 1, lost in Syriac). At least some of them seem to have been
               composed in Greek. The editio princeps was by J. R. Harris in 1909 (2nd ed. 1911,
               after F. C. Burkitt had discovered a second, even more incomplete ms.). In both
               Syriac mss., H and N, the Odes of Solomon are followed by the 18  Psalms of Solomon.
               It should be noted that one and the same Syriac term (viz. <hi rend="italic">zmirtā</hi>) is used for both, ‘Ode’ and ‘Psalm’. Before the discovery of the
               Syriac texts of Odes of Solomon 3–42 (H) and 17–42 respectively (N, sometimes
               labelled B) our knowledge of these enigmatic poems (also described as hymns, psalms,
               and songs) was restricted to the Latin quotation of Solomon’s ‘ode’ 19.6–7a by
               Lactantius (early 4th cent.), the listing of ‘Psalms and Odes of Solomon’ as OT <hi rend="italic">antilegomena</hi> in the so-called ‘Synopsis’ of Pseudo-Athanasius
               (7th cent.) and the ‘Stichometria’ ascribed to Nikephoros (8th– 9th cent.), and the
               Coptic version of Solomon’s ‘odes’ 1, 5, 6, 22, and 25 quoted in the Gnostic work
               ‘Pistis Sophia’ (3rd cent.; <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> A, 4th cent.). These five
               pieces were taken from a Greek collection in which the Odes of Solomon were preceded,
               not followed, by the Psalms of Solomon. In 1959 the Greek text of Ode 11 was
               published by M. Testuz (<hi rend="italic">Papyrus Bodmer</hi>, XI [3rd– 4th cent.]).
               In the Syriac version of this very ode we find the only verse (viz. 11.23a) which has
               left a clear trace in Syriac literature (cf. Ephrem, ‘On Paradise’, 7.21). The
               author(s), date, and place of origin are unknown. It is, however, probable that the
               anonymous odes later attributed to Solomon were composed and used by gnosticising
               Christians in bilingual Syria as early as the 2nd cent. In form and content they
               appear to be strongly influenced by biblical language and show some connection with
               texts from Qumran. The Saviour is also called Lord, Son, and Messiah, but never
               appears under the name of Jesus. Dominant theological terms are Spirit, God, Lord,
               Most High, and Father. Among the most important soteriological concepts are grace,
               joy, knowledge, life, light, love, rest, truth, and word.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Monk in the early 6th cent. to whom pantheist ideas were attributed; likely author of
               the ‘Book of the holy Hierotheos’. Our earliest evidence on Sṭephanos is a letter
               written to him by <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>. Albeit on a friendly tone,
               Yaʿqub cautions against dreams and nightly visions and refutes the idea that
               punishment in the hereafter would not be eternal. Much harsher is <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos</ref>, bp. of Mabbug, who between 512 and 518 wrote about Sṭephanos to
               two priests in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, Abraham and Orestes, who had been in
               touch with Sṭephanos. They are strongly warned against Sṭephanos’s evil influence.
               Philoxenos portrays Stephanos as a heretic, who equates the creation with God:
               adopting the allegedly Jewish idea of a thousand-year rest (symbolized by the
               Sabbath, which comes after the sixth day, symbol of this world), he assumes that
               everything will come to one consummation and will be of one nature with God on the
               first (i.e. the eighth) day. Philoxenos also notes that Sṭephanos, who left Edessa to
               live near <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>, had once been a follower of ‘John the
               Egyptian’ (whose identity cannot be established) and that he had borrowed the concept
               of ‘motion’ (<hi rend="italic">mettziʿānutā</hi>), applied to the sixth day, from the
               ‘monk Evagrius’, i.e. <ref rend="bold">Evagrius of Pontus</ref>. A few further details
               on Sṭephanos and on Philoxenos’s actions against him are provided in the Chronicle of
                  <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, in the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of 1234</ref>,
               and in <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s Chronicle.</p>
                    <p>That Sṭephanos is the author of the pseudepigraphic ‘Book of the holy Hierotheos’ is
               explicitly stated by the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref rend="bold">Quryaqos</ref> (793–817).
               The ‘Book’, originally written in Syriac, indeed reflects several of the ideas that
               Philoxenos attributed to Sṭephanos. It deals with the ascent of the mind towards God
               and with the final process of unification, whereby everything becomes one being. The
               author’s revelations are presented as being secret, and accessible only to the
               initiated.</p>
                    <p>While some ideas in the ‘Book’ ultimately go back to Origen, scholars have
               demonstrated the ‘Book’s’ dependence on the writings of Evagrius of Pontus, whose
               ideas, as expressed in the ‘Kephalaia Gnostica’, were interpreted in the direction of
               a radical pantheism. In addition, the attribution to Hierotheos links the ‘Book’ to
               the corpus attributed to <ref rend="bold">Dionysius the Areopagite</ref>, who is said
               to have been a student of Hierotheos. This twofold orientation has led some scholars
               to assume two layers in the redaction history of the ‘Book’: a first layer, which is
               Evagrian, and a slightly later one, which responds and makes additions to the
               Pseudo-Dionysian writings. While Sṭephanos in all likelihood is the author of the
               first layer (not yet attributed to Hierotheos), the second layer may be the work of
               his pupils, who used the popularity of the Pseudo-Dionysian writings to promote their
               master’s teachings.</p>
                    <p>In spite of the controversy about its authorship, the ‘Book’ enjoyed popularity in
               the Syr. Orth. Church. Commentaries on it were written by Patr. <ref rend="bold">Theodosios</ref> (887–896) and later by Bar ʿEbroyo; they were intended to
               reinterpret the work in accordance with the teachings of the Church. Mostly combined
               with either one of the commentaries, or with both, and thus domesticated, the ‘Book’
               exists in more than 20 mss. Read through the lens of the two later commentaries or
               from the vantage point of two of its main sources of inspiration, the ‘Book’ may not
               yet have received sufficient attention as an authentic expression of early 6th-cent.

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Protestant theologian; scholar of Syriac and Near-Eastern studies. Born on 23 Feb.
               1907 in Dortmund, Strothmann studied theology and Near-Eastern languages at the
               universities of Giessen, Tübingen, Halle, and Göttingen. In 1931 he graduated in
               theology from Göttingen and received the Ph.D. degree from Tübingen with studies on
               the Arabic tradition of the writings attributed to the monk Makarios. After having
               worked at the Septuagint project in Göttingen between 1931 and 1934, he served as a
               Lutheran pastor near Braunschweig between 1934 and 1962. From 1958 onwards, he held a
               teaching position in Syriac Church History at the Theological Faculty of Göttingen
               University. At the same university, he received his Habilitation in 1964 with a study
               on <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>. In 1965, he was appointed professor in
               Syriac Church History. He tirelessly worked in this field until his death, on 19 June
               1996, in Göttingen.</p>
                    <p>During his years at Göttingen, Strothmann’s focus was on Syriac studies, which he was
               able to promote vigorously in Germany and to which he attracted a great number of
               students. He founded the Göttinger Arbeitskreis für syrische Kirchengeschichte,
               which already in 1968 published the so-called ‘Lagarde-Schrift’, a volume that
               commemorated the Syriac work of <ref rend="bold">P. A. de Lagarde</ref>. In 1971, he
               organized the first Syriac Conference at Reinhausen, near Göttingen, which was
               attended by ca. 40 Syriac scholars as well as by the Syr. Orth. Patr. <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Yaʿqub III</ref>. Not only did this meeting strengthen the collaboration
               between Western scholars and the churches of the Syr. tradition, it also gave the
               impetus for the international <ref rend="bold">Syriac Conferences</ref> that
               subsequently were held every four years, starting in Rome in 1972 (‘Symposium
               Syriacum’).</p>
                    <p>Strothmann initiated a large-scale project on the ‘Religious and cultural history of
               the Near and Middle East’, which was funded by the German Research Council and which,
               among other things, involved the creation of the series ‘Göttinger
               Orientforschungen’, with a sub-series ‘Syriaca’ (which includes more than 30 volumes,
               the majority of which were authored by Strothmann himself). Since Strothmann was
               primarily a philologist, with a particular interest in Syriac mss. and texts, many of
               the volumes contain text editions, written with a Syriac typewriter that was
               developed in the Netherlands. Within the framework of the Göttingen project, he was
               also instrumental in creating the multi-volume concordance of the Syr. OT, to which
               he himself contributed a great deal of work. This project made use of newly emerging
               computer technology (see <ref rend="bold">Computing, Syriac</ref>).</p>

               attested since the end of the 16th cent. Later on, 19th and 20th cent. Sureth texts
               exhibit dialectal features of other districts, such as the mountain villages on the
               Iraqi-Turkish border or the town of Mosul. The ms. transmission of Sureth texts is
               characterized by phonetic spelling, unlike the rather historico-etymological standard
               in use for <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref> Neo-Aramaic (Assyrian). The earliest attested
               texts are religious poems belonging to the <ref rend="bold">dorekthā</ref> genre.
               Wedding songs in Sureth (<hi rend="italic">zmeryāthā d-rāwe</hi>) have been recorded
               in written form by European and Assyrian scholars. Spoken or literary varieties of
               Sureth are also known as Felliḥi, Iraqi koine, Modern Syriac, Neo-Syriac, Vernacular

                    <p>Monastery situated halfway between Cairo and Alexandria in the Wadi al-Natrun,
               ancient Scetis, Egypt. Today one of the flourishing monasteries of the Coptic Church,
               it derives its name from the earlier presence of a Syr. Orth. community. Whereas its
               foundation as an Egyptian monastery probably goes back to the 6th cent., the earliest
               evidence of the Syrian presence (in the first period mainly monks from <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref>) is from ca. 800. The Syrian presence came to an end, or lost its
               prominence, at the beginning of the 17th cent.; from then onwards the monastery has
               been entirely Coptic.</p>
                    <p>The main significance of Dayr al-Suryān for Syriac studies lies in the fact that it
               has preserved hundreds of ancient Syriac mss. From the early 18th cent. these began
               to be transferred to European libraries. A  number of mss. came to the Vatican
               Library; the bulk reached the British Museum, London, in the 19th cent. and are now
               at the British Library. The Monastery still holds a small collection (a catalogue is
               in preparation). The Dayr al-Suryān mss. include the earliest dated Syriac ms. (411),
               a great majority of all preserved pre-10th-century mss., and our main witnesses for
               the writings of important authors such as <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref>. No other place in the Middle East has yielded
               such a wealth of Syriac mss. The colophons of the mss. are the main source for our
               knowledge of the history of Dayr al-Suryān. Recent discoveries of murals, paintings
               as well as texts, in the Church of the Virgin provide additional information.</p>
                    <p>In an attempt to explain and justify the presence of the Syrians, three late notes in
               mss. — two of which can be dated to the 16th and 17th cent. — claim that Dayr
               al-Suryān was purchased by Tagritans at an unknown date through the intermediary of a
               certain Marutha. It is very unlikely, however, that a formal purchase ever took
               place. A recently discovered inscription indicates that Syrians were involved in the
               rebuilding of the Monastery in 818/19, after it had suffered damage. It must have
               been on that occasion that they started settling in. Even though a few decades later,
               the Monastery began to be referred to as ‘Monastery of the Syrians’, there is
               evidence that throughout the centuries Coptic and Syriac monks lived together.</p>
                    <p>A period of particular wealth was the first half of the 10th cent., when <ref rend="bold">Mushe of Nisibis</ref> was abbot. Syriac inscriptions in the church bear
               witness to his building activities. To the collection of Syriac mss. he added 250
               volumes, which he brought back from a journey to Mesopotamia (927–31/32). In addition
               to the mss. imported from the Syro-Mesopotamian homeland, Syriac mss. were also
               produced in the Monastery itself.</p>
                    <p>The history of Dayr al-Suryān after the 10th cent. is less well known. There was a
               period of revival around 1200 and in the 13th cent., when new mss. were acquired and
               new wall paintings were produced. This is also the period to which a number of Coptic
               and Christian-Arabic mss. in Dayr al-Suryān can be dated. Towards the end of the 15th
               cent., an abbot of Lebanese origin, Quryaqos (Cyriacus, also known as Severos) gave a
               fresh impetus to the intellectual and cultural life in the Monastery. In 1516, 43
               monks were living in Dayr al-Suryān, 18 Syrians and 25 Egyptians.</p>
                    <p>In the 18th cent., the Church of the Virgin was completely replastered, except for
               three semi-domes that continued to show their 13th-cent. paintings. It is only in
               1995 that conservators and art historians began to remove parts of the plaster, thus
               allowing the earlier layers to reveal a wealth of paintings as well as texts in
               Greek, Coptic, Syriac, and Arabic.</p>

                    <p>Collection of reports and canons of the synods of the Ch. of E. held between the
               years 410 and 775/6. This collection of synods is only one part of a much larger
               collection of canonical and juridical texts, which is transmitted in a single 13th-
               or 14th-cent. ms. (Alqosh Syr. 169), accessible to Western scholars in a number of
               later copies. The larger collection has sometimes been called the ‘great Synodicon’
               (‘Das grosse Synodikon’ in Selb’s description, consisting of 80 items, see p. 59–63).
               The more limited collection, the Synodicon Orientale proper, covers nos. 28–41 of
               Selb’s list. It is this more limited collection that has been edited by Chabot and
               translated by both Braun (GT) and Chabot (FT) under the title Synodicon Orientale.
               Within the ms. itself, the title ‘Book of synods’ (<hi rend="italic">Ktābā
                  d-swnhdw</hi>) is used a few times, either for the collection of E.-Syr. synods
               or, as a <hi rend="italic">pars pro toto</hi>, for the entire collection. The
               collection of synods is specifically introduced with the term <hi rend="italic">swnhdyqw</hi> (plur.) ‘synodical texts’ (Braun: ‘Synodalacten’; Chabot:
               ‘décisions synodales’).</p>
                    <p>Chabot divides the entire collection into three parts (covering 840 pages in the
               Borgia ms.). The part edited by him, the Synodicon Orientale proper, is the second
               (p. 242–561). The first part (p. 1–242; nos. 1–27 in Selb’s list) contains texts
               attributed to the apostles along with canons and related literature of the early
               Greek synods; it also includes the 73 pseudo-Nicene canons attributed to <ref rend="bold">Marutha of Maypherqaṭ</ref>and some other texts relevant to the early
               history of the Ch. of E., such as the correspondence related to <ref rend="bold">Papa
                  bar ʿAggai</ref>. The third part (p. 561–840; nos. 42–80 in Selb’s list) contains
               additional materials pertaining to Cath. Mar <ref rend="bold">Aba I</ref>and <ref rend="bold">Ḥenanishoʿ  II</ref>; extracts from Greek theological writings; the
               monastic canons of <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Kashkar</ref>and his successor Dadishoʿ
               on Mount Izla; the canons of the <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref>; several
               lawbooks associated with the names of cath. <ref rend="bold">Ḥenanishoʿ I</ref> (late
               7th cent.), cath. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref> (d.  823), cath. <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (d. 828), <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Bahrīz</ref> (early
               9th cent.), <ref rend="bold">Shemʿon of Rev Ardashir</ref> (7th or 8th cent.), and <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿbokht</ref> (8th cent.); the Syro-Roman Lawbook; letters of cath.
               Timotheos I; a document concerning <ref rend="bold">Nestorios of Beth Nuhadra</ref>;
               treatises on hereditary law by cath. <ref rend="bold">Eliya I</ref> (d. 1049), <ref rend="bold">Gewargis of Arbela</ref> (late 10th cent.), and <ref rend="bold">Eliya of
                  Nisibis</ref> (bar Shinaya, d.  1046). The presence, at the very end of the
               collection, of a concluding note under the name of cath. Eliya I, may suggest that
               the collection received its final redaction during his tenure (1028–49), even though
               the exact role of this note — in a damaged part of the original ms.  — and Eliya’s
               involvement in the collection have been debated (Kaufhold 1983, 727–30). Several
               items of the collection remain unpublished.</p>
                    <p>The second part of the collection, the Synodicon Orientale proper, contains reports
               of the synods, along with the canons (and in some cases confessions of faith, lists
               of signatures, and relevant letters), of the following synods: cath. <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq</ref> (410); cath. <ref rend="bold">Yahbalaha</ref> (420); cath. <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ</ref> (424, no canons); cath. <ref rend="bold">Aqaq</ref> (486,
               followed by a note on the 484 Synod of <ref rend="bold">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref>, with
               a reference to letters by Barṣawma provided in an appendix); cath. Babai (497, no
               canons); cath. Aba I (544, followed by several documents); cath. <ref rend="bold">Yawsep I</ref> (554); cath. <ref rend="bold">Ḥazqiel</ref> (576); <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb I</ref> (585); cath. <ref rend="bold">Sabrishoʿ I</ref> (596, no canons);
               cath. <ref rend="bold">Grigor I</ref> (605); cath. <ref rend="bold">Gewargis I</ref>
               (676, followed by an important theological letter); and cath. Ḥenanishoʿ II (775).
               There is reason to assume that this collection, focused on the synods between 410 and
               775 (the Synodicon Orientale in the narrower sense), originated independently from
               the other documents of the larger collection. Given the time period covered, it is
               likely that it was put together ca. 800, possibly under the instigation of cath.
               Timotheos I, whose interest in matters of church legislation and canon law is well
               attested. This collection then became one of the main components of the larger
               collection, created at a later period in time. The Synodicon Orientale is an
               extremely valuable source for the study of the history and the theology (Brock) of
               the Ch. of E. in the Sasanian and early Islamic period, even if the later redactors
               may occasionally have updated the terminology or introduced minor changes, according
               to their perspective (Fiey).</p>
                    <p>The textual transmission is based on a single ms.: Alqosh Syr. 169 (Vosté; or no. 90
               in an earlier checklist by A. Scher), the writing of which seemed to Scher (who is
               followed by Vosté) to be ‘prior to the 14th cent.’. This ms. presently is kept in the
               Monastery of the Chaldeans in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> (Ms. 509; cf. Kaufhold
               2005, 230). Mgr. Joseph David brought a 19th-cent. copy to Rome in 1869. This
               two-volume copy became ms. Museo Borgiano K. VI, 4 and 3, and was later incorporated
               into the Vatican Library as Borg. Syr. 82 and 81. Among the first scholars to study
               it was I. Guidi (1889), followed by O. Braun. The latter prepared a German
               translation of the second part of the collection (Synodicon Orientale), which
               appeared in 1900. J.-B. Chabot, while he was planning an edition of the same part,
               was able to use a second copy of the Alqosh ms., which subsequently became ms. Paris,
               Bibl. Nat. Syr. 332 (dated 1895). This contains the Synodicon Orientale only, not the
               larger collection. A number of other copies, complete or incomplete, exist (Selb,
               64–6 and Kaufhold 1983, 730–1). While for the Synodicon Orientale no other mss.
               beyond ms. Alqosh Syr. 169 and its descendants are extant, for a number of the
               sections of the larger collection additional mss. are available or a parallel
               transmission exists in an Arabic collection under the name of Īlīyā al-Jawharī (ca.
               900) and in <ref rend="bold">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Fiqh
                  al-Naṣrāniyya</hi> (Kaufhold 1976, 24–5).</p>

                    <p>The elevation in 1656 of Andrew Akhījān (d. 1677) as Catholic bp. of <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> and then as Patr. in 1662 was the first major attempt to create a
               ‘Syriac Catholic’ branch out of the Syr. Orth. Church of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>. This attempt was short-lived but when the Syr. Orth. bp. of Aleppo
               Michael Jarweh (d. 1800) and four other bishops professed the Catholic faith in 1782
               in <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>, a durable Catholic Church was established.
               Thereafter, numerous communities in Syria, Turkey, Iraq, and Palestine joined the
               Uniate movement, and an unbroken line of successors followed Patriarch Jarweh. Among
               these prelates are the liturgist Jirjis V Shalḥat (d. 1891), the learned <ref rend="bold">Ignatius Ephrem Raḥmani</ref>, (d. 1929), Cardinal <ref rend="bold">Gabriel Tappuni</ref>(d.  1968), and lately Cardinal Mūsā I Dāʾūd, former Prefect
               of the Congregation of Eastern Churches. In 1930 in India, a group within the Syr.
               Orth. Church of Malabar joined the Roman Catholic Church. The <ref rend="bold">Malankara Catholic Church</ref> that emerged shares with the Syriac Catholic
               Church its liturgy but they differ in that the former is Archiepiscopal while the
               latter is patriarchal. The Church currently consists of 3 eparchies (<ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref> [patriarchal], Cairo, USA-Canada), 6 archdioceses (<ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>, Aleppo, <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref>-Nabk, Hasaka-<ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>), 4
               patriarchal eparchies (Turkey, <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>-Holy Land, Baṣra-Gulf,
               Venezuela), 4 missions (France, Sweden, Australia, Brazil), and 1 patriarchal
               procuracy (Rome). The patriarchal seat is in Beirut, where the cyclical synods of the
               Church take place. There too is the Monastery of <ref rend="bold">Sharfeh</ref>, which
               not only contains a precious collection of mss. and a press, but also includes the
               Church’s main seminary. The Church owns other monasteries as well, including <ref rend="bold">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref> in Syria, which contains famous medieval
               wall paintings, and the 12th-cent. <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Behnam</ref> in Iraq,
               an architectural jewel and a true museum of lapidary art. Syr. Catholic monastic and
               priestly communities include the Ephremite nuns in Lebanon, an ascetic community in
               Dayr Mār Mūsā in Syria, and the ‘Priests of Jesus the King’ in Iraq, a group that
               promotes priestly communal life.</p>

               ‘Symposium Syriacum’ (papers published in OCA 197, 1974), thus providing the name for
               succeeding international Syriac conferences, which take place every four years in
               different locations: <hi rend="italic">SymSyr</hi> [II] in Paris, 1976 (OCA 205,

               conferences have been held in conjunction with ones on Christian Arabic (published
               separately). International Syriac Conferences have also been held (normally even four
               years) since 1987 at the St. Ephrem Ecumenical Research Institute (SEERI) in Kottayam
               (Kerala, India).</p>
                <p>Besides these international meetings a number of different regular regional
               conferences have grown up. Notable among these are two series in Lebanon: the
               Symposium Syro-Arabicum: I, [Kaslik] 1995 (<hi rend="italic">ParOr</hi> 20–2,
               1995–7); II, 1998 (<hi rend="italic">ParOr</hi> 27–8, 2002–3); and the (mostly)
               annual conferences on specific themes, entitled Patrimoine Syriaque. The first of
               these latter was held in 1993 in Antelias, and the proceedings of each are published
               by the Centre d’études et des recherches orientales (CERO, Antelias). In N. Iraq and
               Turkey a series of conferences on the Syriac language have been held, with the papers
               from the 4th (Mardin, 2008) published in Nuhadra/Duhok, 2009.</p>
                <p>In Europe, a Deutsches Syrologen-Symposium has been held annually since 1998 (most
               are published in Studien zur Ostkirchengeschichte, ed. M.  Tamcke); also in Germany
               and elsewhere the <ref rend="bold">diaspora</ref> community has organised a number of
               conferences of an academic nature. The annual conferences of the French Societé
               d’études syriaques (since 2003) are devoted each year to a specific topic, with the
               papers published in the series Études syriaques (1–, 2004–). In Italy, an annual
               series of meetings, entitled Incontro sull’Oriente Cristiano di tradizione siriaca,
               has been taking place in Milan since 2002, with the proceedings for each edited by E.
               Vergani and S. Chialà. A series of occasional Peshitta Symposia, organised by the
               Peshitta Institute, Leiden, is held at irregular intervals since 1985, the
               proceedings being published in the Peshitta Institute’s Monograph Series (MPIL).</p>
                <p>The First North American Syriac Symposium was held at Brown University (Providence,
               RI) in 1991, and it has since been followed by meetings every four years in different
               locations: Catholic University of America in 1995 (Washington D.C.), University of
               Notre Dame in 1999 (Notre Dame, IN), Princeton Theological Seminary in 2003
               (Princeton, NJ; see E.  Aydin, in <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi>6.2 [2003]);
               University of Toronto in 2007 (Toronto, Canada; see G. A. Kiraz, in <hi rend="italic">JCSSS</hi>7 [2007], 103–4), and Duke University scheduled for 2011 (Durham, NC).
               In addition to the North American Syriac Symposium, the Dorushe Annual Graduate
               Student Conference on Syriac studies has met every spring at different universities
               since 2006: Catholic University of America in 2006 (Washington D.C.; see J.-N.
               Saint-Laurent, in <hi rend="italic">Hugoye</hi>9.2 [2006]), Princeton University in
               2007 (Princeton, NJ), University of Notre Dame in 2008 (Notre Dame, IN), and Yale
               University in 2009 (New Haven, CT; see A. M. Butts, in <hi rend="italic">Henoch
               </hi>31.2 [2009], 460–62). In Toronto, the Canadian Society for Syriac Studies has
               held annual conferences and smaller meetings since 2000, the main papers of which are
               published in the <hi rend="italic">JCSSS</hi> (2001–). Beth Mardutho has held a
               number of <ref rend="bold">computing</ref> forums in conjunction with other
               conferences.</p>
                <p>Besides these series of conferences, an impressive number of other academic
               conferences, usually on specific topics, have begun to take place in recent years,
               such as that in Stockholm (2006), on <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, organised by
               Syrianska-Arameiska Akademiker Föreningen, and that in Aleppo (2008), on <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, organised by the Syrian Orthodox

                    <p>Syriac, the self-designations of which are <hi rend="italic">suryāyā</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ārāmāyā</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">urhāyā</hi>, is a dialect of the
                  <ref rend="bold">Aramaic</ref> language branch, which is itself a member of the
               larger Semitic language family. Syriac is generally grouped in the late Aramaic
               period (ca. 200–1200) despite the fact that it is attested from the 1st cent. AD to
               the present. Though previously considered an East-Aramaic dialect, some evidence
               suggests that Syriac should be classified as a separate branch of late Aramaic that
               is distinct both from East-Aramaic, which includes Mandaic and Jewish Babylonian
               Aramaic, and from West-Aramaic, which includes <ref rend="bold">Christian Palestinian
                  Aramaic</ref>, Samaritan Aramaic, and Jewish Palestinian Aramaic. In comparison to
               other late Aramaic dialects, Syriac preserves many features of earlier ‘Standard
               Literary Aramaic’.</p>
                    <p>Syriac is by far the best documented Aramaic dialect. Based on the designation <hi rend="italic">urhāyā</hi> ‘(the language) of Edessa’, it is likely that Syriac
               originated in or around <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>. As the primary language of
               Syriac Christianity, it spread over much of Mesopotamia and Syria reaching as far as
               Ethiopia, India, and Central Asia. Syriac is first found in non-Christian tomb <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref> that date from the 1st to the 3rd cent. These
               inscriptions display a number of archaic features — some of which also occur in early
               mss. — that were lost in the standardization of classical Syriac. The majority of
               Syriac literature stems from the Christian communities that emerged in Mesopotamia
               and Northern Syria starting in the 2nd cent. AD. The ‘Golden Age’ of Syriac spanned
               from the 4th to the 7th cent. and produced a considerable corpus of original prose
               and poetry as well as translations from Greek. After the Islamic conquests in the 7th
               cent., Syriac was gradually replaced by Arabic though it lived on for several
               centuries and even witnessed a brief renaissance in the 12th and 13th cent. (see <ref rend="bold">Syriac Renaissance</ref>). Alongside the numerous Neo-Aramaic dialects
               (see Aramaic, <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ṭuroyo</ref>), classical
               Syriac still functions today as a liturgical and literary language for Syr.
               Christians both in the Middle East and the worldwide <ref rend="bold">diaspora</ref>
               (see <ref rend="bold">Kthobonoyo Syriac</ref>). In addition to the large surviving
               literary corpus related to Syriac Christianity, Syriac is attested in incantation
               bowls, amulets, inscriptions, and documentary texts written on <ref rend="bold">papyrus</ref> and parchment (for the latter, see <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac
                  Documents</ref>).</p>
                    <p>After the Christological controversies in the 5th and 6th cent., Syriac split into an
               E.-Syr. and W.-Syr. tradition. The differences between these traditions appear
               primarily in <ref rend="bold">script</ref> and phonology. While the Esṭrangela script
               continued in restricted use in both traditions, the W.-Syr. tradition adopted Serṭo
               as its primary script, and the E.-Syr. tradition developed a new script based on
               Esṭrangela. In phonology, the E.-Syr. tradition employs a seven vowel system, which
               more closely reflects earlier stages of Aramaic. In the W.-Syr. tradition, however,
               several vowel changes occurred, e.g. the shifts of *<hi rend="italic">ā</hi>to <hi rend="italic">o</hi>, *<hi rend="italic">ē</hi> to <hi rend="italic">i</hi>, and
                  *<hi rend="italic">o</hi> to <hi rend="italic">u</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Like all Aramaic dialects, Syriac throughout its long history has been in contact
               with other languages. In addition to inheriting a number of Akkadian and Persian
               loanwords from earlier periods of Aramaic, Syriac borrowed lexemes from Middle
               Persian, Hebrew, and  — later in its history — Arabic. The language that had the most
               significant impact on Syriac, however, is Greek. Greek influence is found in texts
               from the earliest period, such as the ‘Book of the Laws of the Countries’ (see <ref rend="bold">Bardaiṣan</ref>) and the <ref rend="bold">Odes of Solomon</ref>, and
               reached its apex in the 5th through 7th cent. when the translation movements were in
               progress (see <ref rend="bold">Greek, Syriac translations from</ref>). This close
               contact with Greek had an effect on Syriac not only in its vocabulary where many
               Greek loanwords are found, but also in syntax and even morphology.</p>
                    <p>Syriac has enjoyed a long tradition of academic study in Syriac-speaking communities.
                  <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref> (d. 708) is traditionally considered the
               first author of a Syriac grammar. Although this work does not survive in its
               entirety, portions of it were incorporated into the so-called Syriac <ref rend="bold">Masora</ref> (<hi rend="italic">mašlmānutā</hi>). This important compilation also
               contains vocalized texts of the OT, NT, and patristic authors, which serve as a rich
               source of philological and grammatical material. As is the case with so many of the
               sciences in Syriac, the grammatical tradition was codified by the polymath <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (d. 1286), who wrote both a small metrical grammar and
               a much larger opus entitled ‘The Book of Splendors’ (<hi rend="italic">ktobo
                  d-ṣemḥe</hi>). Syriac-speaking communities also produced works on <ref rend="bold">lexicography</ref>, the most well-known of which are the Syriac-Arabic
               dictionaries of <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿAli</ref> (second half of the 9th cent.) and of
                  <ref rend="bold">Bar Bahlul</ref> (fl. 10th cent.).</p>
                    <p>The study of Syriac in the West, which began in the 16th cent., culminated at the
               turn of the 20th cent. with the publication of the grammar of <ref rend="bold">Th.

                    <p>Despite widespread translation activity and the use of Syr. in Late Antiquity by
               numerous non-native speakers, there are no surviving Syr. lexical materials from this
               early period, with the exception of two 4th-cent. Manichaean Syr.-Coptic glossaries
               written on wooden boards, found in the kitchen of an abandoned house at Kellis in the
               Dakhla Oasis of Egypt (Franzmann and Gardner). These were produced by the translator
               of a Syr. text into Coptic, and so the order of the Syr. words is determined by their
               occurrence in the source text. It is likely that similar glossaries will have been
               produced by other Syr. translators, and particularly in the 7th cent. when formal
               one-to-one Greek to Syr. correspondences were common, but these have not
               survived.</p>
                    <p>Lexical works of a different kind were produced by the Syr. scribal schools, whose
               careful transmission of biblical and patristic texts led to the production of a
               ‘masoretic’ literature that is comparable in many respects to that of contemporary
               Jewish scribes (see <ref rend="bold">Masora</ref>). Some texts preserve the correct
               pronunciation of rare words or foreign names, others provide lists of homographs.
               These lists are often included within grammatical texts, mainly of Ch. of E. origin,
               and are associated with such figures as <ref rend="bold">Yawsep Huzaya</ref> (6th
               cent.), <ref rend="bold">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref> (mid–7th cent.; see Hoffmann 1880 with
               Gottheil 1887, 61*–67*; 1889), <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar Nun</ref> (d. 828), <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref>(809–73; see Hoffmann 1880 with Gottheil 1887,
               61*–67*; 1889), Abdochus (12th cent.), <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (1225–86; see
               Martin), and <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (d. 1318).</p>
                    <p>The first real Syr. lexica, containing alphabetic lists of words and their glosses,
               were produced in 9th-cent. Abbasid <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> by professional
               translators of Greek scientific texts into Syr. and Arabic, rather than monastic
               scribes, and were often focused on explaining Greek technical loan-words in Syr., and
               other rare vocabulary, rather than listing all Syr. lexemes. One of the first of
               these was Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq’s <hi rend="italic">Puššāq šmāhe yawnāye b-suryāye</hi>
               ‘The interpretation of Greek words with Syriac’. In addition to his work on Greek
               words and his work on Syriac homographs, Ḥunayn is said to have written a
               ‘Compendious Lexicon’ (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, vol. 3.1, 165).
               Hunayn’s lexicographical works were augmented by <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ of Merv</ref>
               (who may or may not be the same person as Zekarya of Merv), and this was in turn
               re-edited by one of Ḥunayn’s students, <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar ʿAli</ref>, and in
               this Syr.-Arabic form it still survives (Hoffmann 1874; Gottheil 1910, 1928).</p>
                    <p>The largest of all these early Syr.-Arabic lexica (often more like an encyclopedia
               than a dictionary), and the most useful for scholars today, is that of <ref rend="bold">                  Ḥaṣan Bar Bahlul</ref>, who lived in Baghdad in the mid-10th cent. (Duval
               1888–1901). He cites many earlier lexical sources, one of the most important of which
               was <ref rend="bold">Ḥenanishoʿ bar Seroshway</ref>, bp. of <ref rend="bold">Ḥirta</ref>
               ca. 900. This lexicon was widely copied by both E.-Syr. and W.-Syr. scribes until the
               20th cent., and they continued to add entries and citations and to edit older entries
               in line with their own theology and christology. One adaptation of Bar Bahlul and Bar
               ʿAli even has the Arabic replaced with Armenian in Syriac <ref rend="bold">script</ref>, possibly for the Syr. Orth. of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> who spoke
               an Armenian dialect (Margoliouth 1898; see also <ref rend="bold">Armenian Christianity,
                  Syriac contacts with</ref>). Duval’s great edition of this work is not a critical
               edition of the earliest form of the work (probably irretrievable) but is largely
               based on W.-Syr. manuscripts containing the fullest form of the lexicon, and so
               includes, for example, references to the 13th-cent. Bar ʿEbroyo.</p>
                    <p>An alternative type of medieval Syr.-Arabic lexicon is ‘The Book of the Interpreter’
               of <ref rend="bold">Eliya of Nisibis</ref> (975  –  ca. 1050), which is divided into 30
               lessons, in which Syr. vocabulary is listed according to subject categories, such as
               names of God, human attributes, parts of the body, trades and professions, minerals,
               colors (de Lagarde 1879).</p>
                    <p>With the beginning of Syriac printing in Europe in the 16th cent., there was a
               growing demand for Syr.- Latin lexica. The first of these was the <hi rend="italic">Syrorum peculium</hi> of <ref rend="bold">Andreas Masius</ref> (1571), included in
               the sixth volume of the Antwerp Polyglot Bible, which like many early European Syr.
               lexica mostly contained Syr. vocabulary from the NT, with some OT additions. More
               widely used than Masius’ work was the frequently reprinted <hi rend="italic">Lexicon
                  pentaglotton</hi> of Valentino Schindler (1612) and the NT lexica of Johann
               Buxtorf the younger (1622), Martin Trost (1623), Aegidius Gutbier (1667), and Carl
               Schaaf (1708). Castell’s <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Heptaglotton</hi> (1669), which
               was printed to accompany Walton’s London Polyglot Bible, was the first to incorporate
               all the Syr. of the OT as well as to make systematic use of the medieval Syr.-Arabic
               lexica. Michaelis extracted the Syr. vocabulary from Castell and republished it in
               1788, and this became the standard Syr. lexicon in the early-19th cent., although
               much criticised.</p>
                    <p>The late-19th cent. saw the production of numerous major Syr. lexica which remain key
               reference works today (although they pre-date most critical editions of Syr. texts).
               The largest was the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus syriacus</hi> (1868–1901) of <ref rend="bold">Robert Payne Smith</ref>, which built upon the unpublished lexical mss.
               of numerous European colleagues, especially Quatremère and Bernstein, and
               middle-eastern lexica, both the medieval texts mentioned above and the 1619 lexicon
               of the Maronite George Karmsedinoyo, and contains numerous citations, as well as
               proper names. Smith was assisted by his daughter <ref rend="bold">Jessie Payne
                  Smith</ref>, who also compiled a supplement and the standard Syr.-English
               dictionary (published 1896–1903). <ref rend="bold">Carl Brockelmann</ref>, a student of
                  <ref rend="bold">Theodor Nöldeke</ref>, published an excellent Syr.-Latin
               hand-lexicon (1894–5; 2nd ed. 1923–28) which includes some rare vocabulary not found
               in the work of the Smiths, and has now been translated into English and expanded by
               Sokoloff. Very important Syr. lexica printed in the middle-east include that of <ref rend="bold">Toma Audo</ref> (1897, 1901) which contains a very great number of old
               Syr. forms not found in the European lexica, and so to a lesser extent the
               Syr.-Arabic lexicon of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqob Awgen Manna</ref> (1900). Notable
               20th-cent. lexica include the Syr.-Arabic-French hand-lexicon (1963) of <ref rend="bold">Louis Costaz</ref>, and the Syr.-English-Malayalam lexicon of Emmanuel
               Thelly (1999), which makes good use of Audo.</p>
                    <p>The world-wide <ref rend="bold">diaspora</ref> of Syr.-using Christians, and the
               arrival of Syr. word-processing software, has produced an explosion of Syr. lexica in
               recent decades. These are notable for including Classical Syr. neologisms for modern
               ideological and technological terminology, and some particularly useful examples were
               published by Hanna and Bulut (2000), Khoshaba and Youkhana (2000), and Afram
               (2005).</p>
                    <p>Although Christian Neo-Aramaic was included in Payne Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi>, the first dedicated dictionary was the Assyrian-Russian work of
               Kalashev (1894), soon followed by the important Assyrian-English dictionary of
               Maclean (1901). Large lexica of the Christian NENA dialects were later published by
               David (1924), Sarmas (1969, 1980), and Sargizi (2002), and less comprehensive lexica
               of <ref rend="bold">Ṭuroyo</ref> by Ritter (1979), Jacob and Asmar (1985), and Ishaq
               (1988).</p>

                    <p>It is one of the Oriental Orthodox Churches who accept the councils of Nicea,
               Constantinople, and Ephesus, but reject Chalcedon. Its liturgical language is Syriac,
               though translations of liturgical texts into local languages are permitted. The
               Church traces its roots to the apostolic episcopal traditions of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>. In the 6th cent., it had a distinct line of patriarchs who resided
               outside of Antioch in various locations in the Near East until they settled, more or
               less, in <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Zaʿfarān</ref> near <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>
               during the 13th cent. After the massacres known as <ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref>, the
               patriarchate was transferred to <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref>in 1933, and later to <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref> in 1957. Now, the patriarch resides at Maʿarrat Ṣaydnāyā.
               Since 1293 its patriarchs adopted the name Ignatius, after the 2nd-cent. bp. of
               Antioch. The current Patr. is Ignatius Zakka I. The church is divided into
               (arch)dioceses, each headed by a bp. or archbishop who is under the jurisdiction of
               the Patr. and accountable to the Holy Synod. Some archdioceses are ‘patriarchal
               vicarates’; the patriarchal vicar, regardless of ecclesiastical office, is
               accountable directly to the Patr. The local head of the church in Malankara is the
                  <ref rend="bold">Maphrian</ref> (or Catholicos) who is under the jurisdiction of the
               Patr. and is accountable to the Holy Synod and to the local Malankara Synod. He is
               consecrated by the Patr. and presides over the local Holy Synod. The Church has been
               a member of the World Council of Churches since 1960 and is one of the founding
               members of the Middle East Council of Churches. The Church has issued two joint
               declarations with the Roman Catholic Church and another with the Greek Orthodox
               Patriarchate of Antioch (see <ref rend="bold">Ecumenical Dialogue</ref>). There are
               400,000 to 500,000 adherents dispersed in the Middle East, Europe, the Americas, and
               Australia, in addition to ca. one million in India. The Church is sometimes known by
               the misleading and not acceptable names Jacobite and Monophysite (the term Miaphysite
               is acceptable).</p>

                </ab>
                <div type="body">
                    <p>A rendering into Syriac of the Septuagint column of Origen’s Hexapla. The Greek
               Christian writer and biblical scholar Origen (ca. 185 – ca. 253) created the
               text-critical tool known as the Hexapla in order to recover the ‘original’ Greek of
               the Septuagint. The Hexapla was a six-columned synopsis of Scripture, giving the
               Hebrew text word by word, lined up with a Greek transcription and four Greek
               translations, namely the Septuagint and the three later Jewish versions of Aquila,
               Symmachus, and Theodotion. Origen marked up the fifth, Septuagint, column with
               text-critical signs to indicate where material had been added or omitted in
               comparison with the current Hebrew text used by the rabbis (which Origen assumed was
               identical with the text from which the Septuagint had been translated).</p>
                    <p>The Hexapla must have been too vast to copy in its entirety, and the original, which
               was created and kept in Caesarea, may have perished during the Persian or Arab
               invasions of the mid–7th cent. Only a few folios of Psalms remain, and these date
               from the 9th and 10th cent. Since the focus of the Hexapla itself was on the
               Septuagint column, it was this which was copied separately along with its critical
               signs, and eventually even the latter were omitted from most Greek mss. This
               Hexaplaric Septuagint column was also translated literally into Syriac by <ref rend="bold">Pawlos of Tella</ref> in 616–17 and supplemented with short readings
               from the other Greek versions. The Syro-Hexapla is of particular value for scholars,
               because it has preserved the text–critical signs as well as fragments from the later
               Jewish Greek versions. For theological and geographical reasons, it was much more
               influential among W. Syrians than in the Ch. of E., though it seems to have been
               ‘rediscovered’ by <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref> (see Braun) and was certainly used
               by the 9th-cent. E.-Syr. scholar <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> in his
               biblical commentaries (see Van Eynde, XXII–XXV). It was an influence on <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>’s revision of the OT, and individual readings
               have sometimes crept into later <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> mss.</p>

                    <p>Tagrit is a modern city located on the west bank of the Tigris, almost mid-way
               between <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>. While the early
               history of Christianity in this city and its region is shrouded in mystery, by the
               late 5th cent., there is evidence of a local E.-Syr. community. By the
               mid-6th  cent., Tagrit had become a W.-Syr. stronghold headed by ‘metropolitans’
               representing the Syr. Orth. patriarchs of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> in Sasanian
               and Islamic Iraq and further east. Three such leaders left monumental churches on the
               citadel of Tagrit or outside of it: <ref rend="bold">Aḥudemmeh</ref>, the first
               Metropolitan (559–75), <ref rend="bold">Marutha</ref> the ‘Great Metropolitan’
               (629–49), who not only built the Great Church of the citadel but is also said to have
               opened the city to the Arab invaders, and Metropolitan Bar Ishoʿ, who, between 669
               and 683, built the Church of Sergius and Bacchus recently excavated by Iraqi
               archaeologists. Fortress-like monasteries were also known to Tagrit. The monumental
               one recently uncovered in the nearby site of <hi rend="italic">al-Kanīsa</hi> ‘The
               Church’, contained coins dated as late as 1225, and offered wall paintings, graves of
               abbots buried along with their crosses and staffs, and Syriac <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref> and records of such metropolitans as Yuḥanon bar Kipho (d.
               688), Yawsep I (d.  778), and Athanasios I (d. 903). The 9th–11th cent. period, the
               Golden Age of Christian Tagrit, witnessed the rise of such great authors as the
               theologian and apologist Ḥabīb b. Khidmā Abū Rāʾita (fl. 828), <ref rend="bold">Anṭun
                  of Tagrit</ref> (9th cent.), and the brilliant translator and ‘dialectician’ <ref rend="bold">Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī</ref> (d. 974). Trade was a major occupation of Tagritans,
               some of whom (it was later claimed) purchased in the early 9th cent. a Coptic
               monastery in the Scetis desert (Egypt), filling it with rare mss. and embellishing it
               with beautiful wall paintings. The monastery named after the Mother of God became
               known as the ‘The Monastery of the Syrians’ (<ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>).
               Pressure by the Muslim majority resulted in the shift of the metropolitan seat from
               Tagrit to Mosul in 1156, by which time its metropolitans were called maphrians. After
               the fall of Baghdad at the hands of the Mongols in 1258, Tagrit little by little lost
               its Christian population, and the latter deserted the city altogether by the 15th
               cent.</p>

               after his studies in the local <ref rend="bold">Seminary of St. John</ref>, he was
               ordained priest in 1903. He worked as the secretary of Désiré-Jean Drure, the
               apostolic envoy in Iraq, from 1908 until he was ordained tutelary bp. of Baṭnan of
               Serugh and patriarchal vicar over <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> on 19 Jan. 1913. He
               witnessed in this city the genocide perpetrated against the Christians by the Ottoman
               Turks (see <ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref>) and worked heroically to alleviate the
               suffering and misery endured by them until he was himself caught in the middle. He
               was imprisoned in June 1918 and was freed in Oct. of the same year after the
               intervention of the Vatican and the Empress Zita of Austria. Tappuni was appointed
               patriarchal vicar in <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> in 1919, then archbishop of the same
               city in 1921. He was elected patr. of the Syr. Cath. Church on 17 June 1929, residing
               in <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref> rather than in Mardin. He was made Cardinal in 1935,
               the first Syriac ever, and participated in the election of three popes in the
               Conclaves of 1939, 1958, and 1963. At the Second Vatican Council he was a member of
               the presidential council, the first Middle-Easterner in this position. Cardinal
               Tappuni was a builder, erecting churches in Aleppo (St. Ephrem), a patriarchal
               palace, a seminary (<ref rend="bold">Sharfeh</ref>), and two schools in Beirut, and
               other churches elsewhere. He was also a great administrator, promoting solid priestly
               education in Sharfeh and founding a religious order for women (the Ephremite
               sisters), for which he built a large convent in Beirut. He was honored with medals by
               many European and Arab countries and was a close friend of General Charles De Gaulle.
               At the national and Arab levels, he was heeded by the Lebanese presidents of his time
               and by Arab heads of states and ministers. He died on 29 Jan. 1968 and was buried in
               the monastery of Sharfeh near Beirut.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Apologist, teacher, composer of the <ref rend="bold">Diatessaron</ref>. A well-born
               pagan born in ‘Assyria’ (which might mean either Syria or Assyria), Tatian was
               interested in finding a ‘true’ philosophy. Passing through many schools, he
               eventually converted to Christianity and ended up in Rome, probably about 150. There
               he became a student of Justin Martyr and eventually had his own school. After
               Justin’s death (which occurred between 163 and 167), Tatian was expelled from the
               primitive Roman community for heresy; <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref> dates this
               separation to 172. Irenaeus lists three reasons: Tatian 1. was arrogant in his role
               as a teacher; 2. became a follower of Valentinus’s gnostic teachings; and 3. espoused
               Encratism. <ref rend="bold">Epiphanius</ref> provides us with our last glimpse of
               Tatian, reporting that he returned to the East, founded a school in Mesopotamia, and
               had influence in Cilicia, Antioch on the Orontes, and Pisidia.</p>
                    <p>In antiquity Tatian was famed as an apologist. Only one of his apologetic works
               survives, the ‘Oration to the Greeks’. Divided into two parts, the first is a
               vitriolic indictment of everything Greek; the second is a chronology whose purpose is
               to demonstrate that Moses antedated Homer. Both Clement of Alexandria and Eusebius
               praise the ‘Oration’ and its chronology. Today, however, Tatian is famed as the
               creator (or compiler) of the Diatessaron (Greek <hi rend="italic">dia-tessaron</hi>
               ‘through [the] four [Gospels]’), a gospel harmony widely used in the early Eastern —
               especially Syr. — Church. Although based on sources written in Greek, the Diatessaron
               appears to have been composed in Syriac. It is regarded as the first Syriac
               translation of the Gospels. Known in the Syrian world by either its transliterated
               Greek name or as the <hi rend="italic">ewangeliyon da-mḥallṭe</hi> (‘the Gospel of
               the mixed’), it was apparently the standard gospel in the Syriac Church until at
               least the early 5th cent. This is apparent not only from explicit references to its
               liturgical use (in the <ref rend="bold">Teaching of Addai</ref> and Bp. <ref rend="bold">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref>’s ‘Compendium of heresies’, I.20), but also the
               insistence of Bp. <ref rend="bold">Rabbula of Edessa</ref> (‘Canon’, 43) on the use of
               the <hi rend="italic">ewangeliyon da-mparrše</hi> (‘the Gospel of the separated’) in
               churches. Many of the harmonizations found in the <ref rend="bold">Old Syriac
                  Version</ref> (the Sinaitic Syriac and the Curetonian Syriac) and  — to a lesser
               degree — even in the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>, seem to originate in the
               Diatessaron. The preeminence of the Diatessaron in the early Syriac Church cannot be
               minimized: <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref> seems to quote it, and <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> composed a commentary on it. As late as the 9th cent., Bp. <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> cited its readings in his Gospel commentaries.
               Its importance for critical historical studies is also of the first order: it has
               long been used by scholars for reconstructing the oldest strata of gospel traditions
               and the shape of the canon in the 2nd cent.</p>
                    <p>Probably because of the high esteem accorded the Diatessaron in the East, early
               Eastern reports concerning Tatian are positive. He is even accorded an almost
               mystical understanding of the divine intent behind the Gospels because of his skill
               in harmonizing parallel passages. Only after the time of <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref> (ca. 1275) do we find Eastern sources unambiguously describing
               Tatian as a heretic, something the West had done since Irenaeus (ca. 185).</p>
                    <p>Tatians’s known <hi rend="italic">oeuvre</hi> includes: 1. ‘Oration to the Greeks’
               (ed. Markovich; ed. Whittaker; ed. Schwartz); 2. Diatessaron (for the numerous
               editions of the many witnesses in many languages, see Petersen); 3. ‘Problems’ lost.;
               4. ‘On animals’ lost; 5. ‘On perfection according to the Savior’ lost; 6. ‘To those
               who have propounded ideas about God’ reported as a planned treatise; whether ever
               written is unknown.</p>

                    <p>An organization for the support and welfare of Syr. Orth. orphanages and schools,
               popularly known by the Syriac acronym Taw Mim Simkath (English T.M.S.) which
               originally referred to Ottoman Turkish <hi rend="italic">Terakkiyât-ı Mekteb-i
                  Süryânî</hi> (perhaps influenced by the Ottoman <hi rend="italic">İttihâd ve
                  Terraki Cemiyeti</hi> ‘Committee of Union and Progress’), and later Arabic <hi rend="italic">taraqqī al-madāris al-suryāniyya</hi> ‘Progress of Syriac Schools’
               (much later the somewhat awkward Syriac <hi rend="italic">tdareg madršotho
                  suryoyotho</hi> was coined). It was charted under the English name <hi rend="italic">Assyrian National School Association of America, Inc.</hi>, and
               sometime between 1949 and 1968 was renamed <hi rend="italic">The Assyrian Orphanage
                  and School Association of America, Inc.</hi>, its current official name, but it
               remains popularly known by <hi rend="italic">Taw Mim Simkath</hi>. Its inception was
               on 8 Oct. 1889 when eleven individuals, originally from Diyarbakır (<ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>), met in Sterling, New Jersey. They each agreed on an initiation fee
               of $1 (= $26.78 in 2008) and a weekly pledge of five cents (= $1.34 in 2008), but did
               not have a specific purpose or name. On 25 March 1900, a meeting was held where new
               members joined, one of whom was Gabriel Boyajy, a new arrival from Diyarbakır. He
               suggested a name and purpose: opening a school in Diyarbakır when finances permitted.
               It was around this time that an initial Constitution and By-laws were drawn up. By
               1908, the organization had grown with several branches at College Point (Long Island,
               New York), Paterson, and Sterling, resulting in a need for an executive Board of
               Trustees, which then incorporated the organization in the State of New Jersey, with a
               Constitution drafted by Gabriel Boyajy. In the aftermath of the 1915 <ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref> massacres, the members changed their focus from supporting education
               just in Diyarbakır to general education support. In 1919, an orphanage was
               established in Adana, Turkey, in cooperation with the French High Commissioner. There
                  <ref rend="bold">Dolabani</ref> taught Syriac to what would become a new generation
               of modern writers. After a short period of three years, the French High Commissioner
               withdrew support and planned to move the orphans to Paris. Instead, T.M.S., in
               cooperation with the community in <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref> Lebanon, moved the
               children to Beirut in 1923 and then built a small complex in Khandaq al-Ghamīq and
               transferred the orphanage there in 1926. In 1973, the school was moved to Burj Ḥammūd
               where it remains. By T.M.S.’s Golden Jubilee in 1949, about 160 students had
               graduated from the orphanage, some of whom became luminaries in modern Syriac
               literature including <ref rend="bold">Fawlos Gabriel</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ghaṭṭās
                  Maqdisī Elias</ref>, <ref rend="bold">George Danhash</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Ḥanna
                  Salmān</ref>. Currently, the school has 312 students and 20 teachers. T.M.S.
               purchased Syriac metal types in 1921, and a <ref rend="bold">printing</ref> press in
               1923 to support the publication of the periodical <hi rend="italic">Beth Nahrin</hi>.
               T.M.S. continues to hold an annual event to support the school in Lebanon as well as
               other schools and orphanages. It is based in Paramus, New Jersey.</p>

                    <p>Town 15 km. north of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, it is a populous Chald. settlement,
               seat of a bishopric., with a conspicuous <ref rend="bold">diaspora</ref> in Iraq
               (Mosul, <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>, Baṣra, etc.) as well as in the USA, especially
               in San Diego and Detroit. Ecclesiastic sources give a population of around 900 Chald.
               families living in Telkepe in 1961. Economy is traditionally based on agriculture,
               periodically suffering drought and parasites. Excavation is not allowed in a
               graveyard on the tell that might cover an Assyrian citadel. The name of Telkepe is
               mentioned in 8th-cent. Arabic sources. Other early information is scarce and
               uncertain. The village was plundered by Murād Bey (Bar Yak) in 1508. From the 17th
               cent. Telkepe was one of the centers promoting union with Rome. A Belgian missionary
               reports that in 1653 the Patr. had left his ordinary residence in the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Rabban Hormizd</ref> under the pressure of continuous Kurdish
               attacks and took refuge in Telkepe. The same missionary complains that there were so
               many priests for such a small village that they were reduced to the level of
               cowherds. In 1743 the Persians of Nādir Shāh, unable to conquer Mosul, plundered
               Telkepe and other villages in the plain. By the end of the 18th  cent. Telkepe is
               described as entirely Chald., but in the 2nd  half of the 19th cent. the clergy of
               the village went through a troublesome period of division and rivalry. As late as
               1890 Budge met a ‘Nestorian’ party in Telkepe. Many influential Chaldeans were born
               in Telkepe, including: <ref rend="bold">Yawsep  II</ref>, the second Chald. Patr. and
               prolific author (b.  1667), the fine <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref> poets (<ref rend="bold">Yawsep of Telkepe</ref>, 17th cent.; Toma Tektek Sindjari and Yawsep
               ʿAzarya, both 19th cent.), the poetess Anne of Telkepe (alive in 1914), and the
               much-debated ‘princess’ Mary Therese Asmar (1804, d. Paris ca. 1870). As a result of
               the arabization policy of 1980–1990, Telkepe now has an Arab majority.</p>

                    <p>The Monastery of Tell ʿAda, also known as the ‘Great Monastery’, is located just over
               48 km. from <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>; 1500 m. north of the present village of Tell
               ʿAda. At its apogee (5th–9th cent.) Tell ʿAda was a vibrant center for W.-Syr.
               monasticism. Tell ʿAda is thought to have been founded by the monk Ammianos and his
               disciple Eusebios in the mid-4th cent. Monks from Tell ʿAda were instrumental in the
               founding of other Syr. Orth. monasteries, such as the neighboring Monastery of
               Eusebona. Tell ʿAda occupied a prominent place in the Syr. Orth. Church from its
               founding through the 10th cent., after which little else is known.</p>
                    <p>The 5th-cent. writer <ref rend="bold">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref> appears to have spent
               some time in this monastery. In his ‘History of the Monks of Syria’ (ch. 4) he
               describes a large community of monks at Tell ʿAda, a community that was already
               spreading out to found other monasteries. One surviving 6th-cent. ms., written in
               this monastery’s scriptorium, contains a collection of poetry from <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of Antioch</ref>. Some letters to Tell ʿAda also survive. The 6th-cent.
               Syr. Orth. bp. <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> addressed a well-known
               letter to the monks of Tell ʿAda (ed. Guidi 1884). Another letter purporting to be
               from <ref rend="bold">Basil</ref> the Cappadocian appears in an early 6th-cent. ms.
               (ed. Albert).</p>
                    <p>Tell ʿAda is famous as the last residence of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>
               and the place where he undertook his revision of the Old Testament. According to <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, Yaʿqub resided here during the last nine years of
               his life before he was asked to return to his bishopric. After living in Edessa for
               four months, Yaʿqub traveled to Tell ʿAda in order to retrieve his books. It was
               there that illness overcame Yaʿqub and he died on 5 June 708. A marginal note by
               Yaʿqub in his revision of the Cathedral Homilies of <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref>
               discloses his familiarity with the region of Tell ʿAda and the neighboring Monastery
               of Mar Eusebona (Hom. 30, PO 36.4, 617).</p>
                    <p>The ruins of Tell ʿAda have been dated by Tchalenko to the 5th cent., although it is
               recognized that the foundation of this monastery may date back to the mid-4th cent. A
               number of Syriac <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref> from Tell ʿAda still exist. One of
               the later inscriptions, dated 941/2, refers to patr. <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan V bar

               with Adam; though its roots lie in Jewish traditions, it is definitely a Christian
               composition, and was probably composed in Syriac, where it is attested in three
               recensions. It consists of three parts, the ‘Horarium’ on the hours of the night and
               day at which different parts of creation offer praise to God; the prophecies of Adam,
               foretelling the flood, the birth, passion, and death of Christ, and the end of the
               world (these are recorded by Seth and buried in the ‘cave of treasures’); and an
               account of the hierarchy of angels. The ‘Horarium’ is found in Greek, but this was
               probably translated from the Syriac third recension. The whole work is also known in
               Arabic, Ethiopic, and Georgian; in all these it is incorporated into the <ref rend="bold">Cave of Treasures</ref>. According to Samuel of Ani (12th cent.) it was
               translated into Armenian by ‘Nestorians’ in the late 6th cent., but only the
               ‘Horarium’ survives of this. Excerpts are also found in Coptic. The date of the work
               (Robinson suggests 3rd cent.), and the nature of its relationship to theCave of
               Treasures, remain unclear.</p>

                    <p>A collection in two books of church regulations claiming to be from the mouth of
               Christ and written down by <ref rend="bold">Clement of Rome</ref>. The work (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 1743) was originally written in Greek (of this only parts
               survive); Cappadocia, Syria, and Palestine (thus Kohlbacher) have all been suggested
               as its place of origin; Rahmani dated it to the 2nd cent. but more recently the late
               4th (White) and the late 5th cent. (Kohlbacher) have both been suggested. The
               translation into Syriac was made in 686/7 by ‘the poor Yaʿqub’ who is usually
               identified as <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>. The work contains three
               different elements: a short apocalypse at the beginning; material going back to the
               ‘Apostolic Tradition’ attributed to <ref rend="bold">Hippolytus</ref>; and descriptions
               of liturgical usage (including a complete initiation rite [II.5–10], as well as a
               number of prayers for different occasions). The third element may portray an ideal
               rather than any local reality. The apocalypse was perhaps added and composed by the
               translator (thus Drijvers). The Testament was taken over in an abbreviated form in
               the Syr. Orth. ‘Synodicon’ in ms. Damascus Patr. 8/11. In Arabic and Ethiopic it
               forms part of the ‘Octateuch of Clement’.</p>

                    <p>Abū al-Ḥasan Thābit b. Qurra b. Marwān al-Ṣābī al-Ḥarrānī, the most famous of the
               ‘Ṣābian’ scholars from the Abbasid period, is one of the few non-Christian authors
               known by name who composed works in Syriac. Thābit was born in <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref>, where he is said in some accounts to have worked as a money
               changer, but spent most of his active life in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>, where he
               studied under Muḥammad b. Mūsā b. Shākir and his brothers, the Banū Mūsā, and went on
               to succeed them as the head of their school. Trilingual in Greek, Syriac and Arabic,
               Thābit distinguished himself both as a translator of Greek scientific and
               philosophical works into Arabic and as an original scholar, especially in mathematics
               and astronomy.</p>
                    <p>Thābit wrote most of his works in Arabic, but also composed a number of works,
               apparently mostly on religious subjects, in Syriac. In al-Zawzanī’s epitome of <hi rend="italic">Taʾrīkh al-hukamāʾ</hi>, the Arabic biographical work by al-Qifṭī
               (ca. 1172–1248), we are given a list of seven treatises on religious subjects which
               Thābit composed in Syriac, and are told in addition that there were further Syriac
               works by Thābit, including those on music and geometry (ed. Lippert, 120.14–21).
               Similarly, <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, after telling us that Thābit wrote some
               150 works on ‘logic, mathematics, astrology, and medicine’ in Arabic, gives us a list
               of sixteen works composed by Thābit in Syriac, and informs us furthermore that he
               himself had access to a majority (<hi rend="italic">suggā</hi>) of them (Chronicle,
               ed. Bedjan, 168.11–23). The titles given by Bar ‘Ebroyo are: ‘(1) book concerning the
               laws and canons of the pagans (<hi rend="italic">ḥanpe</hi>); (2) book concerning the
               interment of the dead; (3) book concerning the confirmation of the confession of the
               pagans; (4) book on purity and defilement; (5) book on animals which are fit to be
               sacrificed; (6) book on times of prayers; (7) book on readings that are suitable for
               each of the seven stars in prayers; (8) book on repentance and supplication; (9) book
               of music; (10) book of the chronicle of the ancient Syrian kings, who are Chaldeans;
               (11) book on the confession of the Ṣābians; (12) book on the allotment of the days of
               the week to the seven stars; (13) book on the renown of his race and his forefathers,
               from whom they descend; (14) book of the laws of Hermes and his prayers with which
               the pagans pray; (15) book on the fact that two straight lines meet each other when
               they are made to go out at less than two right angles; (16) another book on the same
               subject’ (on the Arabic version of nos. 15 and 16, see Sabra). Bar ʿEbroyo goes on to
               quote from a work of Thābit (perhaps no. 13) what may be called a <hi rend="italic">plaidoyer</hi> for paganism and pagan learning (ed. Bedjan, 168.25–169.10). One
               quotation in Bar ʿEbroyo’s grammatical work, the ‘Book of splendors’, which is stated
               to be from the ‘book of the pagans’ (ed. Moberg, 39.6f.), may be taken from a work of
               Thābit. Further information on Ṣābian religious practices gleaned from Thābit’s works
               is given by Bar ʿEbroyo in his ‘Epitome of the history of the dynasties’ (<hi rend="italic">Mukhtaṣar taʾrīkh al-duwal</hi>, ed. Beirut 1958, 153).</p>

                    <p>Pythagorean philosopher, usually considered to be either the wife or the daughter of
               Pythagoras (d. 497/6 BC). Several writings in Greek and Syriac are attributed to
               Theano. The Greek texts consist of nine sayings, seven letters, and a fragment from a
               work ‘On Piety’ (<hi rend="italic">Peri eusebeias</hi>). Their date is difficult to
               determine: the letters may be of a 2nd to 5th cent. date, whereas the sayings and the
               fragment may represent an earlier tradition. The Syriac texts consist of a collection
               of 65 sayings, entitled ‘Advice of Theano’ (ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,658),
               other isolated sayings, and a passage of Pseudo-Nonnus’s ‘Mythological Scholia on
                  <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>’ (ed. Brock). The Syriac texts focus on
               themes of general ethical advice, such as charity, friendship, avoidance of anger,
               inner freedom, and the pursuit of virtue rather than wealth. Unlike similar <hi rend="italic">gnomologia</hi> (such as the ‘<ref rend="bold">Sentences of
                  Sextus</ref>’), the ‘Advice of Theano’ has not undergone a Christian redaction.
               This collection may date from the 3rd cent. The Syriac texts are translations from
               the Greek, but their original is not among the extant Greek fragments. The content of
               the Syriac Theano tradition, however, resembles certain sections of the Greek
               tradition. Moreover, there are similarities between the Syriac sayings and other
               Pythagorean gnomologia.</p>

                    <p>Raised as a child acrobat in the circus, Theodora married the future emperor
               Justinian I in 523. Upon the death of his uncle Justin I in 527, the couple ascended
               the throne together. An empress of immensely strong character, Theodora was known for
               her sympathetic support for the dissenting Miaphysite Christians, persecuted under
               Justin I and Justinian in their campaigns on behalf of a Chalcedonian imperial
               orthodoxy. To the exiled church leaders and monks, Theodora provided financial help
               and protection. She also housed the exiled patriarchs in the imperial palace of
               Hormisdas in Constantinople during the extensive but ultimately fruitless theological
               debates sponsored by Justinian. She supported the missionary activities of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref> and Theodore of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>,
               during which the foundations of a separated Oriental Orthodox church were laid, and
               particularly the nascent Syr. Orth. Church. She remains a revered figure among the
               Syr. Orth. to this day.</p>
                    <p>The most important evidence for Theodora’s life and activities comes from two writers
               who knew her personally: the notoriously scathing portrait of the Greek historian
               Procopius in his ‘Anecdota’ and the sympathetic depiction offered by the Syr. bp. and
               historian <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> in both his ‘Lives of the Eastern
               Saints’ and his Ecclesiastical History. Subsequent W.-Syr. tradition transformed her
               story into a hagiographical romance, claiming she was the chaste daughter of a
               Miaphysite priest from Mabbug (or Kallinikos), whom Justinian met while on military
               campaign in the east and married against the will of her father. She is the subject
               of a play in Arabic by Pawlos Behnam (translated into Syriac by <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon Dolabani</ref>).</p>

                    <p>Bp. of Mopsuestia, biblical commentator, author of theological works and homilies.
               Little is known of Theodore’s early years, except that he studied with the pagan
               rhetor Libanius in <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> and probably knew <ref rend="bold">Diodore of Tarsus</ref> and <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref>. That he wavered
               from his ascetic endeavors and needed to be rebuked by John Chrysostom rests entirely
               on the identification of Theodore with the addressee of John’s letter ‘To the fallen
               Theodore’, an identification Theodore’s later opponents were eager to make, but for
               which there is very little evidence. In 392 Theodore became bp. of Mopsuestia, north
               of Antioch, a position that he held until his death in 428. He died in peace with the
               Church.</p>
                    <p>Following the deposition of <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref> at the Council of Ephesus
               (431), Theodore began to be seen as the originator of Nestorianism. <ref rend="bold">Rabbula</ref>, bp. of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> and follower of <ref rend="bold">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>, anathematized Theodore’s works in 432 and ordered them
               to be burned. Although Theodore was somewhat rehabilitated when at the Council of
               Chalcedon (451) <ref rend="bold">Hiba</ref>’s letter to Mari the Persian was read,
               which spoke about Theodore in positive terms, later he again was targeted for his
               allegedly Nestorian views, which eventually led to his condemnation at the Fifth
               Ecumenical Council at Constantinople (553).</p>
                    <p>Theodore’s works started being translated into Syriac perhaps even during his life,
               or shortly after his death. They became very popular in Edessa, in particular at the
                  <ref rend="bold">School of Edessa</ref>, even though the followers of bp. Rabbula
               (d. 435) strongly rejected them. They had a decisive influence on those theologians
               who in the second half of the 5th cent. left Edessa and founded a new School in <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>, within the Persian Empire. The theology of the
               late–5th-cent. councils of the Ch. of E. primarily reflects the views of Theodore. He
               saw a clear distinction between the divine and human natures in Christ: the Word of
               God indwelt the assumed Man, whereby the two came together in one ‘person’ (Greek <hi rend="italic">prosōpon</hi>, Syr. <hi rend="italic">parṣopā</hi>), serving as one
               object of veneration. In his biblical interpretation Theodore, a major representative
               of the so-called School of Antioch, saw the biblical text primarily in its historical
               context. Only rarely, and under strict conditions, was he willing to admit NT
               references or Christological typologies within the OT. His main interpretative
               framework was God’s salvation plan, seen as a process of education throughout
               history, leading up to the NT realities and the hereafter, whereby each individual
               phase is respected in its own right. Theodore rejected the idea of double meanings in
               the biblical message, which he saw as the major shortcoming of allegorical
               interpretation, which he connected with Philo of Alexandria and Origen.</p>
                    <p>While only small portions of Theodore’s works survive in Greek (with the exception of
               the commentary on the Twelve Prophets, which survives in its entirety), E.-Syr.
               tradition has preserved a collection of 16 catechetical homilies (ed. Tonneau and
               Devreesse), biblical commentaries dealing with both OT and NT (ed. Sachau, Vosté,
               Tonneau, Jansma, and Van Rompay), and a disputation with the followers of Macedonius
               (ed. Nau). One major theological work, on the Incarnation, existed in the library of
               Msgr. <ref rend="bold">Addai Scher</ref> in <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref>, Turkey, but it
               was lost during the First World War. Excerpts and quotations from many more of
               Theodore’s works can be found in a great number of E.-Syr. writings, while he is a
               much quoted authority in all E.-Syr. biblical commentaries, often introduced with the
               simple term <hi rend="italic">mpaššqānā</hi>, i.e., the Interpreter. One of the
               Eucharistic Anaphoras in use in the Ch. of E. is attributed to him.</p>

                    <p>Bp., biblical exegete, church historian, hagiographer, and defender of Antiochene
               Christology against <ref rend="bold">Cyril of Alexandria</ref>. Born in <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> to a pious mother who took him regularly to visit monks in the
               outskirts of Antioch, in particular Peter the Galatian. Theodoret was made bp. of
               Cyrrhus (60 miles northeast of Antioch in the diocese of Hierapolis/Mabbug) in 423
               and participated in the Council of Ephesus (431), defending <ref rend="bold">Nestorius</ref> against Cyril of Alexandria. Deposed by the Second Council at
               Ephesus (449), he was reinstated at Chalcedon (451).</p>
                    <p>Theodoret is the author of a number of biblical commentaries, an argument for the
               superiority of Christianity over paganism, a response to <ref rend="bold">Eutyches</ref> against the miaphysite position, an Ecclesiastical History which
               continued <ref rend="bold">Eusebius</ref>’s chronicle to 428, and the ‘History of the
               Monks of Syria’ (<hi rend="italic">Historia Religiosa</hi>).</p>
                    <p>The ‘History of the Monks of Syria’ is a collection of 30 brief to medium-length
               lives of ascetics in the region of Antioch from the early 4th to mid-5th cent., many
               with whom Theodoret had personal contact and interaction. The lives follow
               chronologically the course of Theodoret’s life. The first 20 lives are of ascetics
               who were deceased by the time of Theodoret’s writing; the last ten describe ascetics
               who were still living when he wrote. Also, the first 13 ascetics are located in the
               Antioch region, where Theodoret was raised and educated, while the latter 17 center
               around Cyrrhus, the locus of his episcopacy.</p>
                    <p>Theodoret portrays the ascetics in similar patterns with little character
               development, helping to create an image of Syriac Christianity dominated by severe
               asceticism. Yet, Theodoret depicts himself intervening with a number of ascetics in
               his role as bp. to mitigate the rigor of their asceticism.</p>
                    <p>Theodoret wrote all his works in classical Greek, but was fluent in Syriac evidenced
               by his many conversations with contemporary ascetics. In the life of Jacob of
               Cyrrhestica, a demon approaches and speaks to Theodoret in Syriac (21.15).</p>
                    <p>Noteworthy lives include: <ref rend="bold">Yulyana Saba</ref> (2) — subject of a long
                  <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> attributed to <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>; Peter the
               Galatian (9) — an ascetic who healed Theodoret’s mother and converted her to a more
               sober lifestyle; <ref rend="bold">Maron</ref>  (16)  — the namesake of the founder of
               the Maronite community (<ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon Maron</ref>); Jacob of
               Cyrrhestica   (21)  — the lengthiest written life and the first ascetic still living
               at the time of Theodoret’s writing; <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>  (26)  —
               the most celebrated of Theodoret’s figures. Two chapters concerning women ascetics
               are included at the end of the ‘History of the Monks of Syria’: Marana and Cyra (29)
               and Domnina  (30).</p>
                    <p>The ‘History of the Monks of Syria’ includes a prologue and an epilogue on divine

                <ab type="infobox">(probably d. after 829) [Melk.]</ab>
                <div type="body">
                    <p>Author, bp. of <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref>. Little is definitively known about the
               life of Theodoros Abū Qurra. He was likely born in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> toward
               the middle of the 8th cent. At an unknown date, he became bp. of Ḥarran. He is
               traditionally thought to have been a monk at the monastery of Mar Saba, though this
               has recently been called into question (see Lamoreaux 2002). In his Chronicle, <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>(d. 1199) reports that Abū Qurra was deposed from his
               see by Theodoret, the Melk. Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> (Chabot, <hi rend="italic">Chronique de Michel le Syrien</hi>, vol. 3, 32–4 [FT]; vol. 4, 495–8
               [Syr.]). The historicity of this has, however, also recently been challenged (see
               Lamoreaux 2005, xiii–xv). In the Chronicle of Michael Rabo, Abū Qurra is also said to
               have travelled to Armenia where he debated with the Syr. Orth. scholar <ref rend="bold">Nonos of Nisibis</ref> (d. after 861) in the court of the Armenian prince Ashot
               Msaker (d. 826). This event, which occurred between 813 and 817, is corroborated by
               the writings of Ḥabīb b. Khidma Abū Rāʾiṭa (d. after 830), a relative of Nonos and
               the one who sent him to Armenia. Around the same time, Abū Qurra translated the
               pseudo-Aristotelian treatise <hi rend="italic">De virtutibus animae</hi>into
               Arabic(ed. with GT Kellermann). In the anonymous <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of
                  1234</ref>, it is reported that a debate took place in 829 between Abū Qurra and
               Caliph al-Maʾmūn (r. 813–33) (ed. J.-B. Chabot, <hi rend="italic">Anonymi auctoris
                  Chronicon ad annum Christi 1234 pertinens</hi>, II [CSCO 82; 1916], 22–3; FT A.
               Abouna and J.-M. Fiey, <hi rend="italic">Anonymi auctoris Chronicon ad A.C. 1234
                  pertinens</hi>, II [CSCO 354; 1974], 15–6). A literary text purporting to be an
               account of this debate is preserved in a number of mss. (ed. Dick 1999; ed. with ET
               Bertaina 2007); its historicity is, however, disputed (see D. Bertaina, ‘The debate
               of Theodore Abū Qurra’, in <hi rend="italic">Christian-Muslim relations</hi>, ed.
               Thomas and Roggema, 556–64).</p>
                    <p>Abū Qurra is among the first Christians known to have written in Arabic. According to
               his own testimony (Bacha 1904, 60–1; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 119), he also wrote in
               Syriac, though none of his Syriac works are known to survive. His works are extant in
               both Arabic and Greek as well as Georgian translations (for the latter, see
               Datiašvili). The textual tradition of these works is not, however, very well
               understood (a monograph is in preparation by J. C. Lamoreaux).</p>
                    <p>Abū Qurra’s works in Arabic are as follows (titles generally follow the abbreviated
               versions in Lamoreaux 2005): ‘On free will’ (ed. Bacha 1904, 9–22; ed. with IT Pizzo
               and Samir; GT Graf 1910, 223–38; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 195–206); ‘On the Trinity’ (ed.
               Bacha 1904, 23–47; GT Graf 1910, 133–60; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 175–93); ‘On the death of
               Christ’ (ed. Bacha 1904, 48–70; GT Graf 1910, 198–223; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 109–28);
               ‘On the confirmation of the Gospel’ (ed. Bacha 1904, 71–75; GT Graf 1910, 128–33; ET
               Lamoreaux 2005, 49–53); ‘On the method of the knowledge of God’ (ed. Bacha 1904,
               75–82; GT Graf 1910, 160–8; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 157–64); an untitled work on
               salvation, three sections of which are extant (ed. Bacha 1904, 83–91, 180–186,
               91–104; GT Graf 1910, 169–98; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 129–49); ‘Letter to David’ (ed.
               Bacha 1904, 104– 139; GT Graf 1910, 239–77); ‘Against the Jews’ (ed. Bacha 1904,
               140–54; ed. with FT Bacha 1905; GT Graf 1910, 88–102; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 27–39); ‘On
               the councils’ (ed. Bacha 1904, 154–79; GT Graf 1910, 103–128; ET Lamoreaux 2005,
               61–81); ‘Treatise on the veneration of the holy icons’ (ed. Dick 1986; GT Graf 1910,
               278–333; ET Griffith 1997; IT Pizzo); ‘Treatise on the existence of the Creator and
               the true religion’ (ed. Dick 1982; GT Graf 1913; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 1–25, 41–7,
               165–74 [who argues that this is actually three separate treatises]); ‘Confession of
               faith’ (ed. with FT Dick 1959, 56–62; ET Lamoreaux 2005, 151–4); ‘On the
               characteristics of the true religion’ (ed. with FT Dick 1959, 62–7; ET Lamoreaux
               2005, 55–7); ‘Questions on free will’ (ed. with ET Griffith 1979; ET Lamoreaux 2005,
               207–8); ‘Against the Armenians’ (ed. with ET Lamoreaux 1992; ET Lamoreaux 2005,
               97–101). In addition, there are a number of unpublished works in Arabic (see Samir
               1999, 433–36; 2005, 101–13; Lamoreaux 2009, 470–3).</p>
                    <p>The Greek works attributed to Abū Qurra are collected (with LT) in Migne’s <hi rend="italic">Patrologiae Graecae</hi>, vol. 94, col. 1595–1598; vol. 97, col.
               1445–1610. An ET of many of these is available in Lamoreaux 2005. Most of the Greek
               works against Islam have recently been re-edited with GT by Glei and Khoury. Some of
               these are not, however, by Abū Qurra, but rather are part of a collection of
               dialogues reported by John the Deacon (see Lamoreaux 2001). The authenticity of a
               number of the other Greek works attributed to Abū Qurra is also uncertain. Though
               there are several substantial treatises, most of the Greek works are fragments that
               probably belonged at one time to larger, now lost treatises. It is explicitly
               mentioned in the introduction to <hi rend="italic">Opusculum</hi>4 that it was
               translated from Arabic by Michael Synkellos (<hi rend="italic">PG</hi>, vol. 97, col.

               for <hi rend="italic">Opusculum</hi> 9 (see Griffith 1979). In addition to the
               published works, there are a dozen or so unpublished texts in Greek attributed to Abū
               Qurra; most of these are short though there is a more extensive refutation of Islam
               (see Lamoreaux 2005, xxvi).</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Author, who taught at the exegetical school of Kashkar. Though there has been some
               controversy in the scholarly literature concerning his dates, there now seems to be
               general consensus that Theodoros bar Koni completed his main literary work, the
               Scholion, in 792/3 (for discussion, with previous literature, see Griffith 1981,
               161–4). Little else is known about his life. In his ‘Catalogue’, <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> attributes the following works to Bar Koni (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, vol. 3, 198–9): 1. Scholion; 2. Ecclesiastical History;
               3. treatises (<hi rend="italic">mallpānwāthā)</hi>; 4. funerary discourses (<hi rend="italic">buyyāʾe</hi>). Only the first of these is known to survive. The
               Scholion exists in two recensions: the Siirt (ed. Scher; FT by Hespel and Draguet)
               and the Urmia (ed. with FT by Hespel [additions only]; the section on the ‘Pauline’
               epistles was independently ed. with GT by Brade). The mss. of the Siirt recension are
               generally the earlier of the two, and the text of the Urmia recension is the longer.
               The two recensions also differ at times in their arrangement. Overall, the Urmia
               recension seems to represent a later version of the text that has been supplemented
               and expanded over time.</p>
                    <p>The Scholion is a manual or textbook of the theology of the Ch. of E. In its present
               form, it is composed of 11 <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>. The 11th <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> and possibly also the 10th may, however, be later expansions (even if
               by Bar Koni, himself). The first nine <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> are organized
               according to the biblical text. <hi rend="italic">Memre</hi>1–5 treat the OT, whereas
               6–9 treat the NT. These <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>are not structured as a running
               commentary, but rather are in the form of questions and answers, a genre employed by
               other E.-Syr. exegetes, such as Bar Koni’s near contemporary <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar
                  Nun</ref> (d. 828) (for this genre, see ter Haar Romeny). Interspersed between the
               questions and answers are lists of difficult words and phrases accompanied by
               explanations. Many of these words are technical expressions which may have no longer
               been understood by readers of the biblical text in the 8th cent.; in addition, the
               difficulty with a smaller group of these words may stem from the original translation
               of the OT where either the Hebrew was followed too closely (often calqued) or a
               neologism was created (see Salvesen). Bar Koni’s exegesis is based first and foremost
               on <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>, the exegete <hi rend="italic">par
                  excellence</hi>of the E.-Syr. tradition. In Bar Koni’s words, the Scholion is
               intended for ‘those who are coming for the first time to a consideration of the
               reading of the commentaries of the blessed interpreter (i.e. Theodore)’ (Scher [CSCO
               69], 231). In addition to Theodore, a variety of other authors are cited, including
                  <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>and <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref> as well as Origen, <ref rend="bold">Basil of Caesarea</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>, <ref rend="bold">John Chrysostom</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Dionysius the
                  Areopagite</ref>. In a number of places, Bar Koni’s Scholion shows striking
               similarities to other E.-Syr. exegetical works, such as the ‘Selected Questions’ of
               Ishoʿ bar Nun, the Diyarbakır Commentary (ed. Van Rompay), and the Commentaries of
                  <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref> (fl. ca. 850). The exact relationship
               between each of these works has not yet been entirely explained, though it has been
               shown that some if not all of these works had access to a common source and that Bar
               Nun’s ‘Questions’ and the Diyarbakır Commentary were among Ishoʿdad’s various sources
               (see Van Rompay 2000, 566–570 with much of the relevant literature; see also <ref rend="bold">Exegesis, OT</ref>). Compared to Bar Nun and Ishoʿdad, Bar Koni seems to
               have been a stricter follower of Theodore of Mopsuestia and to have left less room
               for spiritual exegesis, as can be seen for example in his opinion that the Song of
               Songs is <hi rend="italic">lā yutrān</hi> ‘useless’ (Scher [CSCO 55], 324). It should
               be noted that in addition to questions of a strictly exegetical nature, Bar Koni
               often discusses various philosophical and theological concepts within the first 9 <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>. It is for this reason that Griffith (1982) has proposed
               that the Scholion be seen not solely as an exegetical commentary, but rather as a <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi>of theology of the Ch. of E.</p>
                    <p>The 10th <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi>of the Scholion is an apology for Christianity
               against Islam (see Griffith 1981). The question and answer format of the previous <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> is replaced in this <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi>by a
               dialogue between a teacher, who speaks on behalf of Christians, and a student, who
               speaks on behalf of Muslims or <hi rend="italic">ḥanpe</hi>‘pagans’ as stated in the
               text (an obvious word-play with Arabic <hi rend="italic">al-ḥanīf</hi>‘a true
               believer, muslim’). This <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi>is an important representative
               of Muslim-Christian dialogue in the early Abbasid period (see <ref rend="bold">Islam,
                  Syriac contacts with</ref>).</p>
                    <p>The 11th <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi>of the Scholion is a description of what Bar
               Koni calls ‘all the heresies before and after Christ’ (Scher [CSCO 69], 284). Those
               treated include Zoroastrianism, Mandaeism, Manichaeism, various types of Gnosticism,
               as well as the ‘heresies’ of the Quqites, Orphites, and the Bardaiṣanites, to name
               only a few. One of the sources of this <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi>is the <hi rend="italic">Anakephalaiōsis (CPG</hi> 3765), an abridgement of the <hi rend="italic">Panarion (CPG</hi> 3745)of <ref rend="bold">Epiphanius of
                  Salamis</ref>. Despite the obvious limitations, this <hi rend="italic">memrā
               </hi>remains an important source of information for many of these religions (see
               Pognon, Drijvers, Gerö, and especially Kruisheer).</p>

                    <p>Author and counter-patriarch. He was the son of priest Sahdo bar Wahbun in <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref>. He became a monk and priest, received a theological and
               philosophical education, and mastered Syriac, Greek, Armenian, and Arabic. In the
               1170s he worked as the secretary of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> in the
                  <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo</ref> and was entrusted by the Patr. with the
               task of participating in negotiations aiming at ecclesiastical union that were held
               in Cilician Armenia between the Armenians and Theorianos, the representative of the
               Byzantine Emperor. Accused by Michael of plotting against him, he was expelled from
               the monastery. In 1180, however, four discontented bishops consecrated him as
               (counter-) patriarch in <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>, under the name of Yuḥanon.
               Nevertheless, he was arrested and relegated to lay status at a synod under Michael’s
               direction, and subsequently imprisoned in the Monastery of Barṣawmo. He was able to
               escape and made it to <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>, where he found support with the
               Latin patriarch. From Jerusalem he wrote a long letter to a metropolitan bp. of
               Tarsus, in which he justified his consecration as patr., as well as a conciliatory
               letter to Patr. Michael. After Sultan Saladin took Jerusalem in 1187 he eventually
               returned to Cilicia, where the Armenian King and the Armenian Catholicos acknowledged
               him as the Patr. of the Syr. Orth. He must have had followers among the Syr. Orth. as
               well. The schism within the Syr. Orth Church that had erupted at his consecration
               came to an end when Theodoros suddenly died in 1193. In addition to the two letters
               written from Jerusalem, an Anaphora, an explanation of the liturgy, and two poems
               from his hand have been preserved.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Patr. (887–96), author, and physician. A monk from the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of
                  Mor Gabriel</ref>, Romanos was elected in 887, after a vacancy of four years,
               following the death of Patr. Ignatius I (883). As patr. he took the name Theodosios.
               No details of his tenure are known, except that a few canons attributed to him are
               known in the later tradition. In his primary field of expertise, <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref> mentions ‘a wonderful medical compendium’ (<hi rend="italic">kunošo
                  tmiho b-osyuto</hi>), which after the author’s election as patr. circulated as
               ‘the compendium of Patr. Theodosios’ (<hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History</hi>,
               ed. Abbeloos and Lamy, vol.  1, 389–92); this is, however, not preserved. In another
               work Bar ʿEbroyo reports that Romanos was from <ref rend="bold">Tagrit</ref> (see
               Marsh, 176* and 186).</p>
                    <p>Theodosios’s preserved works include: 1. an explanation of 112 ‘symbolic sayings of
               wise men’ (<hi rend="italic">melle remzonoyoto d-ḥakime</hi>), many of which are of
               Pythagorean origin, as the author himself points out (ed. and FT by Zotenberg; see
               also Marsh, 145, n. 2); 2. a commentary on the Book of the Holy Hierotheos (extracts
               in Marsh and Pinggéra); 3. (in Arabic) a synodical letter to the Coptic Patr. Michael
               III; 4. (also in Arabic) a homily for Lent.</p>
                    <p>Theodosios’s lengthy commentary on the Book of the Holy Hierotheos consists of five
               books. It is preceded by a letter to Eliʿozor (also called Loʿozar), bp. of Cyrrhus,
               who had requested the commentary, as well as by a general introduction, while each
               book has a separate introduction as well. Theodosios seems to accept Hierotheos’s
               authorship and, as far as can be judged from the published extracts, does not mention
               the name of <ref rend="bold">Stephen bar Ṣudayli</ref>. Bar ʿEbroyo, who also wrote a
               commentary on the same book, knew Theodosios’s commentary and used it in his
               work.</p>

               brother, had been a monk at <ref rend="bold">Qenneshre</ref>. His consecration as bp.
               took place under Patr. <ref rend="bold">Quryaqos</ref> (d. 817) and was followed by
               some agitation among the Edessenians, which Quryaqos, however, was able to lay to
               rest (<ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, XII.7; Syr. 493; FT 3.28). Theodosios
               accompanied his brother on a trip to Egypt in 824/5. According to Barsoum, he died in
               832.</p>
                    <p>Theodosios is the author of a historical work. This is not preserved, but it was
               referred to and used by his brother Dionysios, and through him it was known to
               Michael Rabo. In addition, <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (Ecclesiastical History,
               ed. Abbeloos and Lamy, vol. 1, 361–64) attributes to him a Syriac translation of the
               poems (<hi rend="italic">mušḥoto</hi>) of <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>.
               One poem, transmitted in ms. Vat. Syr. 96 (no. 20; S. E. and J. S. Assemani, <hi rend="italic">Bibliothecae Apostolicae Vaticanae … Catalogus</hi>, I.2 [1758],
               521) specifically attributes the translation to Theodosios, while he was priest in
               Edessa, and dates the translation to the year 802 (A. Gr. 1113, June to A. Gr. 1114,
               Dec.). This translation seems to be identical to the one preserved in ms. Vat. Syr.
               105 (which was misdated by the Assemanis and belongs to the 9th cent.). Since these
               poems have been translated on three different occasions (see Gregory of Nazianzus),
               it is not always possible to distinguish between the work of each translator.</p>

                    <p>Patr. of Alexandria; leader of the Egyptian and Syrian anti-Chalcedonians. After the
               death of the Alexandrian patr. Timothy IV (Feb. 535), Gaianus first gained access to
               the patriarchal throne (who stood in the tradition of <ref rend="bold">Julian of
                  Halicarnassus</ref>), but he was removed by the emperor Justinian after only three
               months and replaced with Theodosius, who stood in the Severian-Miaphysite tradition.
               The imperial policy had been much more lenient in Egypt than in Syria (where
               Miaphysite bps. were no longer to be found since the middle of the 520s). But even in
               Egypt, Chalcedonian pressure increased and led to the deposal of Theodosius, in 536
               or 537 (there is no agreement in the sources) and his replacement with a committed
               Chalcedonian in the person of Paul of Tabennisi. Theodosius found refuge in the large
               community of Miaphysite exiles in Constantinople, protected and apparently somewhat
               supported by the empress <ref rend="bold">Theodora</ref>. Following the death of <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> (d. 538, after having lived as an exile in
               Egypt for twenty years), the Syr. Miaphysites turned to Theodosius for leadership.
               Only in the mid 550s did they consider electing their own patr., first Sergius and a
               few years later <ref rend="bold">Pawlos of Beth Ukome</ref>.</p>
                    <p>In his place of exile, Theodosius carried out, with imperial permission, the
               consecration of bp. <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref>, and together with Yaʿqub he
               was instrumental in setting up a new Syr. Miaphysite episcopal hierarchy in the
               550s.</p>
                    <p>Of Theodosius’s literary <hi rend="italic">oeuvre</hi>, which must have been written
               originally in Greek, only small fragments exist in Greek, while a number of texts
               exist in Coptic and Arabic. It is, however, Syriac literature that has preserved by
               far the largest number and the most significant of his writings.</p>
                    <p>The ‘Documenta ad origines Monophysitarum illustrandas’ (a collection of official and
               semi-official documents of the Syr. Orth. Church in the 6th cent., preserved in ms.
               Brit. Libr. Add. 14,602 of the late 6th or early 7th cent.) contain several of
               Theodosius’s letters dealing with church administration and show him at the center of
               the network of Miaphysite bps. and church leaders (ed. Chabot; useful overview in Van
               Roey and Allen, 265–303). Two letters by Theodosius (one to Severus of Antioch, and
               the other to Anthimus of Constantinople) are preserved in <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref> (ed. E. W.  Brooks, in CSCO 84, 158–63 and 168–73; FT in
               CSCO 88, 107–11 and 114–7) and in <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> (ed. Chabot, Syr.
               290–94 and 294–5; FT in vol. 2, 211–7 and 217–9).</p>
                    <p>As a theologian Theodosius was forced to take a stance against the Agnoetai (a group
               of theologians, followers of an Alexandrian deacon, Themistius, attributing a certain
               form of ‘not-knowing’ to the human soul of Christ). Theodosius’s major works in this
               regard are the ‘Tome to Theodora’ (Van Roey and Allen, 16–56 [Syr. and LT]) and the
               ‘Letter to the Armenians’ (ibid., 57–59). Another theological discussion in which he
               became involved concerned ‘Tritheism’ (which focused on the distinctness of the three
               persons of the Trinity and was represented, among others, by <ref rend="bold">John
                  Philoponos</ref>). This issue was dealt with in the ‘Theological discourse’ and
               some related documents (Van Roey and Allen, 103–263).</p>
                    <p>Theodosius’s high standing in the eyes of the Syrian Miaphysites is reflected in <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>’s chapter on the ‘Lives of five patriarchs’
               (ed. E. W. Brooks, in PO 18.4, 684–90).</p>

                    <p>Holy man and bp. His Syr. name is written with final <hi rend="italic">ālaph</hi>,
               which has led modern scholars to read ‘Theodota’ or ‘Theodote’. Theodotos was from
               the village of ʿĀnāt on the mountain of Beth Igalaye in the region of <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>. From a young age, he was inclined towards the study of the Scriptures
               and asceticism and eventually went to the Monastery of Zuqnin to take up the monastic
               habit. At Zuqnin, he met a monk (later to become a bp.) named Severos, who agreed to
               be his spiritual father. Theodotos moved to Severos’s <ref rend="bold">Monastery of
                  Qenneshre</ref> and remained there until the death of Patr. Theodoros in 666/7.
               From Qenneshre, Theodotos made a pilgrimage to Mt. Sinai and <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> and next sailed to Egypt, spending five years there and only
               leaving to escape being made bp. Back in the region of Amid, he continued to work
               miracles and his ascetic feats made him famous. Fleeing another attempt to elevate
               him to the episcopacy, Theodotos spent his next five years in the region of Claudia.
               He was eventually consecrated bp. of Amid by Patr. Yulyanos II (687–707/8). In his
               old age, Theodotos left Amid and founded his own monastery near the monastery of Mar
               Abay at Qeleth. There he would die on 15 Aug. 698.</p>
                    <p>The Syriac Lifeof Theodotos was written down in Samosata by a priest named Shemʿun
               based on information learned from Theodotos’s disciple, Yawsep. Likely composed in
               the early 8th cent., Arabs appear a number of times in the text and it provides a
               window into this earliest period of Christian-Muslim interactions in the Middle East
               (see <ref rend="bold">Islam, Syriac contacts with</ref>).</p>
                    <p>The Lifeof Theodotos is preserved in two mss.: Damascus 12/18 (late 12th cent.) and
               Mardin 275/8, a copy of the Damascus ms. made by Dolabani. The Lifewas translated
               into Arabic (<ref rend="bold">Garshuni</ref>) in 1733/4 and exists in ms. St. Mark’s
               Jerusalem 199. At some point after this translation was made, the Syriac text was
               damaged and consequently, the Garshuni must be used to reconstruct lost passages. A
               Syriac and Garshuni edition is in preparation by A. Palmer and J. Tannous.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Multifaceted author, historiographer, and translator. Theophilos, who is said to have
               been a Maronite, served as astrologer to the Abbasid Caliph al-Mahdī (r. 775–785) and
               wrote in Arabic several works on astrology, among which an influential book on
               military forecasts, which by the mid-9th cent. had been partly translated into
               Greek.</p>
                    <p>Theophilos’s translations from Greek into Syriac include works by <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>, possibly <ref rend="bold">Galen</ref>, and most importantly Homer.
               Even though <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> attributes to Theophilos the translation
               of ‘two books’ by Homer, which seems to suggest that both the Iliad and the Odyssey
               were involved, there is no evidence that the Odyssey ever existed in Syriac. The
               Iliad, by contrast, was known to several authors, such as <ref rend="bold">Anṭun of
                  Tagrit</ref> and the author of the <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of 1234</ref> (who
               incorporated a long extract into his work), and it is plausible that Theophilos’s
               translation was their source. That the Greek text of the Iliad was available to Syr.
               scholars is proven by the underwriting of ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 17,210 (60 folios
               containing the Greek Iliad in a 5th-cent. hand), which was re-used in the early 9th
               cent. for copying works by <ref rend="bold">Severus of Antioch</ref> (see Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue … British Museum</hi>, vol. 2, 548a–550b).</p>
                    <p>In addition, Theophilos is the author of a historical work, which was used by <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> and through Dionysios was known to <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> and to the author of the Chronicle of 1234. Dionysios
               calls Theophilos a Chalcedonian and accuses him of being biased against the Syr.
               Orth., which did not prevent him, however, from using Theophilos to a considerable
               extent. Even though Theophilos’s historical work does not survive, it is not only
               Dionysios who transmits some of his materials. Scholars nowadays assume that
               Theophilos’s work served as the common source on which, in addition to Dionysios, two
               other historians drew: the Byzantine historian Theophanes (who must have known an
               abridged Greek translation) and the Melkite Agapius of Manbij, who wrote in Arabic.
               In all likelihood, Theophilos’s work was a narrative history that focused on the
               early Islamic period, until the middle of the 8th cent. (see Hoyland, 631–71).</p>
                    <p>While some scholars in the past wanted to see the remnants of Theophilos’s work in
               the imperfectly preserved Maronite Chronicle (which covers the period from Alexander
               to the 660s: ed. E. W. Brooks and J. B.  Chabot, in CSCO 3–4 [1904], 43–74 [Syr.],
               37–57 [LT]), this has now become very unlikely, in view of the lack of overlap
               between the Maronite Chronicle and the ‘common source’ referred to above.</p>

                    <p>Composed in Syriac probably in the 3rd cent. (provenance unknown, though
               traditionally placed at <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>), the Acts of Thomas is one of
               the most important of the various apocryphal texts associated with Thomas. The Acts
               of Thomas survive in Syriac and in an early Greek translation; the latter shows less
               signs of revision and appears to preserve a more primitive form of the text. The
               popular Acts of Thomas was translated into several Eastern Christian languages and
               even found its way into the Latin tradition. In a novella of 13 Acts, it presents
               Judas Thomas as a ‘twin brother’ of Jesus and recounts his missionary efforts to
               India — though the text appears confused as to whether he went to N.W. India (perhaps
               Persia) or S. India. The Acts of Thomas culminates in an account of Thomas’s
               martyrdom at the order of king Mazdai in S. India due to the social disruption caused
               by his ascetic teaching. The composite nature of the work is evident. It includes
               liturgical texts illuminating primitive Syriac baptismal and eucharistic practices,
               and incorporates earlier poems: ‘Hymn of the Bride’ and the much studied ‘Hymn of the
               Pearl’. Apart from supplying the earliest known connection between Thomas and Indian
               Christians, the sermons and narratives provide information about early Christian
               evangelistic attitudes and practices in western Asia and illuminate the ascetic
               values that are typical of the Apocryphal Acts generally and of early Syriac
               spirituality in particular. Various attempts have been made to characterize the Acts
               of Thomas as Gnostic, Manichean, or anti-Manichean. Different recensions and versions
               do exhibit particular theological tendencies, and some form of the Acts of Thomas was
               adapted and used by Manicheans. However, the judgment that the original Acts of
               Thomas was basically Gnostic may owe more to the unfamiliarity on the part of many
               western scholars with the distinctive character of early Syriac Christianity.</p>

                    <p>Thomas Christians is the term often used for Christians in south-west India (Malabar)
               belonging to Churches of Syr. tradition, since they trace their origins back to St.
               Thomas who, according to tradition, arrived in South India in 52. The early name
               given to them locally was ‘Nazrani’, which corresponds to <hi rend="italic">nāṣrāye</hi>, which was used by the Sasanian authorities for Christians
               (subsequently taken over in Arabic). Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the 16th
               cent. the Thomas Christians were all part of the Ch. of E. Since the late 16th cent.,
               however, successive divisions have taken place, with the result that today in Kerala
               there are seven different Churches of Syriac tradition: those of the original E.-Syr.
               liturgical tradition are: the <ref rend="bold">Malabar Catholic Church</ref> and the
                  <ref rend="bold">Chaldean Syrian Church</ref> (the latter belonging to the Ch. of
               E., and not the Chaldean Catholic Church); and of W.-Syr. liturgical tradition: the
                  <ref rend="bold">Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church</ref>, under the Patriarchate of
                  <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>; the independent <ref rend="bold">Malankara Orthodox
                  Syrian Church</ref>; the <ref rend="bold">Malankara Catholic Church</ref>; the small
                  <ref rend="bold">Malabar Independent Syrian Church</ref>, and the reformed <ref rend="bold">Mar Thoma Syrian Church</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Written and archaeological sources for the pre-Portuguese period are minimal, local
               written ones having been destroyed at the <ref rend="bold">Synod of Diamper</ref>
               (Udayamperur, 1599). Sea trade between the Red Sea and the south Indian port of
               Muziris (usually identified as Kodungalur/ Cranganore) was well developed by the 1st
               cent. AD, and there is nothing impossible in the strong local oral and written
               traditions that St. Thomas came to south India (although the Syriac <ref rend="bold">Acts of Thomas</ref>, of perhaps the 3rd cent., seem to bring him to the north).
               Several 3rd-cent. Greek sources, however, link him with Parthia. <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> refers to Thomas being killed in India, and states that a merchant
               had brought some of his bones to <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (<hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi>of Nisibis 42.1–2). Mylapore as the site of Thomas’s martyrdom is not
               attested until the Middle Ages, in accounts by Western travellers (<ref rend="bold">Shlemon of Baṣra</ref>, ‘Book of the Bee’, ed. Budge, 119 [tr. 105], knew a
               tradition that ‘he was buried at Maḥluph in the region of the Indians’). Much
               confusion has been caused, especially in Greek and Latin sources, by the ambiguity of
               the term ‘India’, which often clearly refers to Ethiopia or South Arabia.</p>
                    <p>It is unclear when the link with the Ch. of E., in the Persian Empire, was
               established. According to the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref> ( [PO 26],
               I.8), Dodi, bp. of Baṣra (evidently 3rd/4th cent.) left his see to go to India where
               he converted many people; later (PO [117], II.9;) Maʿne, metropolitan of <ref rend="bold">Fars</ref> (late 5th cent.), is said to have composed <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi>, <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">ʿenyāne</hi> in
               (Middle) Persian for liturgical use and sent these books ‘to the islands of the sea
               and to India’. In the early 6th cent. Cosmas Indicopleustes, a friend of the
               Catholicos Mar <ref rend="bold">Aba</ref>, speaks of a church at Male (Malabar) and a
               bp. ‘appointed from Persia’ at Kalliana (identified either as Kalyan, Mumbai-Pune
               area, or as Quilon; ‘Topography’, III.15), and in the mid-7th cent. one of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿyahb III</ref>’s Letters (ed. Duval, p.252) implies that India’s
               line of bishops was dependent on the metropolitan see of Rev Ardashir (in Fars, on
               the Persian Gulf). The link with Fars helps explain why Pahlavi, rather than Syriac,
               features on the various 9th-cent.(?) stone crosses (an improved reading for one of
               these is given by Ph. Gignoux, <hi rend="italic">Studies in Honor of
                  J. C.  Greenfield</hi>, ed. Z. Zevit et al. [1995], 411–22). One of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>’s lost letters was to the Indian Christians concerning
               the election of a bp., and elsewhere he speaks of monks regularly travelling to and
               from India.</p>
                    <p>Although India was supplied with bishops (and from Timotheos’s time, metropolitans)
               from the Middle East, the effective control lay in the hands of the indigenous
               Archdeacon.</p>
                    <p>References to two early migrations from the Middle East to Kerala are first recorded
               by 16th-cent. western writers, based on local oral accounts. The first migration is
               linked to Knai Thoman, represented in western sources as Thomas of Cana, the
               Canaanite (thus also in one Syriac text, Mingana 1926, 481, 513), who is said to have
               come with a group of Christians including a bp. Yawsep (sometimes, of Edessa) in 345.
               Numerous inconclusive attempts to explain the name Knai have been made. The tradition
               is especially important for the endogamous Knanaya (or ‘Southists’) who trace back
               their origins to this Thomas. A later group said to have come from the Middle East
               was led by two bishops, Mar Shabur and Mar Prot (Phrahat, or Peroz?), together with
               ‘the resplendent’ Sabrishoʿ; an exact date, 823, is even given in one Syriac source
               (ed. Land, <hi rend="italic">Anecdota Syriaca</hi>, vol. 1, 27, tr. 125). This
               Sabrishoʿ is often identified with ‘Marovan Sapir Iso’, the builder of the Tharisa
               church in Quilon which was granted certain privileges in a set of copper plates in
               Old Tamil, dated 849.</p>
                    <p>The only pre-Portuguese Syriac document from India is a Lectionary of the Pauline
               Epistles, copied in Shengala (Cranganore) in June 1301, in the time of ‘the Turkish
               Catholicos Patriarch <ref rend="bold">Yahbalaha</ref> V [!, in fact  III] and
               Metropolitan Mar Jacob, governor of the holy throne of Mar Thomas the Apostle’ (ms.
               Vat. Syr. 22); the scribe identifies himself as deacon Zkarya, aged 14.</p>
                    <p>A very important Syriac source from shortly after the arrival of the first Portuguese
               is a letter of 1504, with a historical introduction (ed. Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, III.ii, 589–99; tr. in Mingana 1926, 468–73). This tells how in 1490
               two Indians travelled to Gazarta (modern Cizre) to ask the Cath. for bishops; two
               bishops were consecrated and sent to India, and then in 1501 the next Catholicos sent
               three further ones, who in 1504 dispatched back the letter in question, describing
               the situation of the Thomas Christians (‘some 30,000 households’). One of the two
               Indians in 1490 was ‘Joseph the Indian’ who later provided the account of Malabar
               that formed Book VI of Fracanzano da Montalboddo’s immensely popular <hi rend="italic">Paesi novamente retrovati</hi> (1507). And one of the bishops
               consecrated in 1501 was Mar Yaʿqub who was to play a prominent and difficult role in
               dealing with the Portuguese; he died some time before 1554. A slightly later Syr. bp.
               was Mar Yawsep, consecrated for Malabar by the Chald. Patr. in 1558 (five years after
               the separate Chald. Catholic line had come into being). Western missionaries in
               Bassein, however, were successful in preventing him from reaching his destined flock.
               While in Bassein, and even during his long sea voyages, he diligently copied Syriac
               mss., several of which survive (van der Ploeg 1983).</p>
                    <p>Although the Thomas Christians had at first welcomed the arrival of fellow Christians
               from Europe, by the end of the 16th cent. the situation had changed. The last Indian
               bp., Mar Abraham, died in 1597, and in 1599 the metropolitan see of Angamali was
               demoted to a bishopric under the archbishop of Goa. The next year the Malabar Church
               was put under the Portuguese Royal Patronage (Padroado). The destruction of all
               Syriac books considered heretical at the Synod of Diamper (1599) and the Romanization
               of the rite (though Syriac was still allowed) witness to the domineering character of
               the European hierarchy in India. Any attempts to contact bishops — even Chald.
               Catholic ones — in the Middle East were foiled. In the end, (false) rumors of the
               drowning of a bp. from the Middle East, Mar Atallah, led to open revolt in 1653, with
               the ‘Oath of the Coonan Cross’ (Mattancherry), when the Archdeacon Thomas was
               ‘ordained’ as bp. by 12 priests, claiming to have a letter from Mar Atallah
               legitimizing this. This effectively split the Thomas Christians into two nearly equal
               halves, those who remained under the control of Rome, and those who were in due
               course to come under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Antioch.</p>
                    <p>Contact in due course was made by the adherents of Thomas with a Syr. Orth. bp., Mar
               Gregorios, in 1665, and links with the Syr. Orth. Church were further strengthened in
               1685, when Maphrian Baselios Yaldo and Mar Ivanios were sent to India by Patr.
               ʿAbdulmasīḥ I; although Mar Baselios died shortly afterwards, he left a great
               impression (thus at Kothamangalam a long inscription in his honor was put up in
               1874). In this way the W.-Syr. liturgical tradition (and script) was gradually
               introduced into Malabar, and seems to have been fully effected by the end of the
               first quarter of the 19th cent. (van der Ploeg 1983, 39). Prior to this, in 1772, a
               quarrel had led to schism and the establishment of the separate small Malabar
               Independent Syrian Church, based in Thozhiyur.</p>
                    <p>Further divisions came in the 19th cent., when a reform movement among the Syr.
               Orth., led by Abraham malpan and supported by Anglican missionaries, led to the
               emergence of the Mar Thoma Church, which formally came into being in 1888. The second
               half of the 19th cent. also witnessed the renewal, after a break of some 400 years,
               of the ancient link with Ch. of E., with the emergence of the Chaldean Syrian
               Church.</p>
                    <p>Towards the end of the 19th cent. requests began to be made by the Syr. Orth. to the
               Patr. of Antioch that a Cath. (corresponding in rank to that of the earlier <ref rend="bold">Maphrian</ref>) be appointed for India. Patr. Peṭros IV (III) agreed to
               consider the matter, but nothing was done until the deposed <ref rend="bold">Patr.
                  ʿAbdulmasīḥ II</ref> visited India in 1912 and consecrated Pawlos Mar Ivanios as
               Cath., an action which effected a schism with the party loyal to <ref rend="bold">Patr.
                  ʿAbdullāh II</ref>. Though a re-unification of the two sides was achieved in 1964,
               the break was renewed in 1975. Drawn-out and expensive litigation over property
               remains a running scandal.</p>
                    <p>A different division within the W.-Syr. tradition took place in 1930, when Mar
               Ivanios, together with a sizable group of Syr. Orth., entered into communion with
               Rome, thus marking the beginnings of the Malankara Catholic Church. In the E.-Syr.
               tradition one further division took place in 1968, just within the Chaldean Syrian
               Church, when loyalties became divided between the two Patriarchs, Mar <ref rend="bold">Shemʿon</ref> (New Calendarists) and Mar <ref rend="bold">Darmo</ref> (Old
               Calendarists), leading to the establishment, from 1971, of two rival metropolitans in
               Kerala. This schism, however, was successfully healed in 1995, when the entire
               Chaldean Syrian Church was united with Patr. Mar Denḥa IV (New Calendarists).</p>
                    <p>Syriac remained the language of the liturgy until well into the 20th cent. in most of
               the Churches of Syriac tradition; today, however, it has almost entirely been
               replaced by Malayalam, even among the Syr. Orth. where it has held out longest. A
               large number of Syriac mss. have been copied in Kerala (van der Ploeg). Less frequent
               has been the use of Syriac for <ref rend="bold">inscriptions</ref>, the earliest being
               dated 1575 (Mulanthuruthy); in more recent times it has principally been the Syr.
               Orth. who have retained Syriac for funerary and commemorative inscriptions; an
               impetus to this practice seems to have been given by Mar Kurillos Yuyaqim, from Ḥbob
               in <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>, who came to Malabar in 1846, where he died in
               1875. A Corpus of Syriac inscriptions in Kerala, by F. Briquel Chatonnet, A.
               Desreumaux, and J. Thekeparampil, has recently been published. During the second half
               of the 19th and well into the 20th cent. a number of Syriac <ref rend="bold">printing</ref> presses were functioning; particularly important ones were the St.
               Joseph Press, Mannanam (for E. Syr.), and the Mar Julius Press, Pampakuda (for W.
               Syr.).</p>

                    <p>Cath. of the Ch. of E. Timotheos was born in the village of Ḥazza (near <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref> in Iraq). His education was supported by his uncle
               Gewargis, the bp. of Beth Bgash. In Bashosh and Marga he studied with the famed
               scholar <ref rend="bold">Abraham bar Dashandad</ref>. Abraham was renowned as a scholar
               of the Bible and of <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>. He was also an effective teacher
               of techniques of translation from Greek into Syriac. Timotheos succeeded his uncle as
               bp. of Beth Begash.</p>
                    <p>In 779, the Cath. <ref rend="bold">Ḥenanishoʿ II</ref> was poisoned. At the convocation
               of bishops in 780, Timotheos was elevated to the patriarchate, a position he would
               hold through the rule of five caliphs. Timotheos worked to improve the status of
               Christians in the Caliphate and beyond through a variety of initiatives.</p>
                    <p>First, he worked to improve the moral and educational level of both clergy and laity.
               He encouraged scholarship, including the development of linguistic skills. He both
               translated (Aristotle’s Topics) and encouraged the translation work of others,
               assuring that a large number of texts were translated from Greek into Syriac and
               Arabic. More than two hundred letters were known, about 59 of which survive.
               Timotheos was also the author of ‘The Ordinances of Ecclesiastical Judgments and of
               Inheritance’. This still unpublished tome sought to bring reasoned order to the
               churches. Timotheos’s contributions to biblical studies, hermeneutics, and bible
               translation were significant. He even obtained a copy of Origen’s Hexapla in order to
               have access, for himself and his translators, to the best possible biblical text.
               Timotheos also wrote, according to ʿAbdishoʿ <ref rend="bold">bar Brikha</ref>, a
               commentary on a text of <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nazianzus</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Timotheos also established the juridical structures of the E.-Syr. Church including
               the development of the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>, a collection of the
               decisions of the councils of the E.-Syr. Church. Most importantly, he improved
               understanding between Christians and Muslims. His dialogue with Caliph al-Mahdī
               (775–85) is preserved in both Syriac and Arabic. Beyond the formal discussions, his
               diplomatic skills facilitated the development of the E.-Syr. church in the Caliphate
               and throughout Asia.</p>
                    <p>The organization and spread of Christianity in Asia and the Middle-East consumed a
               lot of Timotheos’s energy. He organized and/or revitalized organization of the
               churches in areas as diverse as <ref rend="bold">China</ref>, Tibet, Yemen, India, and
               Central Asia. He encouraged the production of theological literature in the
               indigenous languages and the development of indigenous non-Syrian leadership of
               churches. While Christians had been establishing communities along the trade routes
               of Asia for centuries, Timotheos provided structure and intellectual renewal for the
               ongoing traditions.</p>

                    <p>Miaphysite Patr. of Alexandria 457–60, 475–7. His nick-name ‘Ailouros’, or ‘weasel’,
               was due to his lean build. He attended the second Council of Ephesus in 449, together
               with Patr. Dioscorus. After the lynching of the pro-Chalcedonian Patr. Proterius in
               457 he was made Patr. but was expelled by the emperor in 460, eventually to be
               restored under Basiliscus. His writings (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 5475–5489),
               originally in Greek, survive for the most part only in Syriac and Armenian. His major
               work, ‘On the Unity of Christ’, against the Council of Chalcedon (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 5475) is complete in Armenian (ed. K. Ter Mekerttschian and E.
               Ter-Minassiantz, 1908; text only) but only in an abridged form in Syriac (not yet
               fully published). Several of his letters and a refutation of another work against the
               Chalcedonian Definition of Faith and the Tome of Leo survive only in Syriac.</p>

                    <p>Metropolitan of India. Abimalek was born in Marbishu in Turkey and graduated from the
               Archbishop of Canterbury’s Assyrian Mission school for priests in 1901. He was made
               an archdeacon in 1904. In 1907, in reply to a petition sent three years earlier from
               the community at Trichur, Mar Benyamin Shemʿon consecrated him for the see of
               Malabar. In India he was an autocratic leader and his career was marked by
               litigation. As the senior bp. in the church he visited Iraq in 1919, 1920–1, and
               1927– 1928. On the second visit he protested against the consecration of Mar <ref rend="bold">Eshai Shemʿon</ref> and was made regent to the boy Patr. But his claim
               to keep this title in 1927 was rejected by the family, and he was deported back to
               India. His special achievement was the foundation of the Mar Narsai Press in Trichur,
               which became the main church <ref rend="bold">printing</ref> office in English, Syriac,
               and Malayalam.</p>

               texts, <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref> attributes to him a refutation of astrology,
               ‘hortatory discourses’ (<hi rend="italic">buyyāye</hi>), anti-heretical disputations,
               and a ‘letter on <hi rend="italic">qāle</hi>’, that is, strophes with prefixed
               versicles that are chanted.</p>

                <ab type="infobox">(9th cent.) [Ch. of E.]</ab>
                <div type="body">
                    <p>E.-Syr. abbot and bp., the author of a monastic history. Toma son of Yaʿqob, was born
               in the 810s in the village of Neḥshon (Book of Governors, II, 311) in the district of
               Beth Sharonaye, in the diocese of Slokh, <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref>.</p>
                    <p>In 832, as a ‘young man’ he became a monk in the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Beth
                  ʿAbe</ref> (‘The Forest Monastery’), in Marga, ca 100 km. north-east of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>. It was one of the most renowned E.-Syr. monasteries, from
               which many bps., metropolitans, and catholicoi of the E.-Syr. Church hailed. When in
               the year 837 a former monk and abbot of Beth ʿAbe, Abraham, became Cath.
               (Abraham  II, 837–50), Toma, his friend in the monastery, became his secretary. A
               few years later (in 840s) Abraham appointed Toma bp. of Marga. We know nothing more
               about his life, and even the date of his death remains unknown.</p>
                    <p>For a long time it was thought that Toma was also appointed by Cath. Abraham II
               metropolitan of <ref rend="bold">Beth Garmai</ref>, and that he was a brother of Cath.
               Theodosios (853–58). However, in the light of Fiey’s research (1965, 362–4), it
               appears that Toma of Marga and Toma the metropolitan of Beth Garmai are two different
               persons.</p>
                    <p>Toma wrote three books, all within the genre of monastic history.</p>
                    <p>The first of them, which may have been entitled ‘The Histories of certain holy men’,
               is only known from his own mention of it in the ‘Book of Governors’. It is probable
               that the material of the former book was re-used by Toma in the latter.</p>
                    <p>Toma’s second work was ‘The History of the Monastery of Rabban Cyprian’ (in Birtha,
               in the diocese of Marga), which contained an account of the first monks (before <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Kashkar</ref>) in this region. This, although written
               earlier, was incorporated as the 6th book of Toma’s third and most comprehensive
               work:</p>
                    <p>The Book of the Governors (Syr. <hi rend="italic">ktābā d-rešāne</hi>), scil. of the
               Monastery of Beth ʿAbe (better: Book of Abbots), is also known in Western scholarship
               as <hi rend="italic">Historia Monastica</hi>. This short title is known only from the
               colophon, whereas the full Syriac title is: ‘Useful stories and accounts of holy men
               and monks who for generations lived in the holy monastery of Beth ʿAbe, written by
               the venerable Mar Toma bishop of Marga’. The work was most probably written ca. 850
               when Toma already was the bp. of Marga. He dedicated it to ʿAbdishoʿ, another monk in
               the same monastery, who encouraged him to write. It was modelled on the pattern of
               the Paradise of <ref rend="bold">Palladius</ref>, known to Toma in the redaction of
                  <ref rend="bold">ʿEnanishoʿ</ref> (ca. 670) (Budge, <hi rend="italic">The
               Book</hi>, vol. 1, xxxi–xxxiii). It provides not only a series of lives of the
               abbots, but also information on the catholicoi, metropolitans, and bps., as well as
               on the establishment of schools, theological controversies, etc. There is much
               material both on monks from other monastic houses (those on Mount Izla) and on the
               development of E.-Syr. monasticism in general from the 6th until the 9th cent. Toma
               also provides important accounts of the non-monastic history of the Ch. of E., such
               as the conversion of the peoples living southeast of the Caspian Sea and the missions
               to South Arabia, Persia, and <ref rend="bold">China</ref>. He writes on the relations
               of the Christians with the Persian and later Muslim authorities, but also on matters
               such as the murder of the Sasanian king Khusrau and the expansion of the Muslim
               empire.</p>
                    <p>Toma has also shown his poetical skills by inserting into Book 3 a <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> in the 12–syllable meter on Maranʿammeh, metropolitan of <ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref>, i.e. of Adiabene, who had also been a monk of Beth
               ʿAbe.</p>

               dialects spoken by the many Assyrians living in Georgia. His original work on these
               dialects resulted in a great number of publications written in Georgian and/or
               Russian. Some of them were subsequently translated into western languages. He also
               published a description of Classical Syriac (1979, in Russian) and a short historical
               grammar of Aramaic, covering nearly three millennia of the history of the Aramaic

                    <p>Bp. of Mabbug (Hierapolis northeast of <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>) at the beginning
               of the 7th cent.; diplomat and Bible translator of excellent Greek education. Only
               one exact chronological date is transmitted (his translation of the NT 615/16), but
               his activities on the official stage of his Church link him with persons and events
               of his time and provide a general idea about the chronology of his life. <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, Ecclesiastical History (I, 50 = vol. 1, col. 267) and
                  <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, Chronicle (X, 25 = vol. 4, 391) give a summary
               of his career: Born at Heraclea (Ḥarqel) in the Euphratensis (northwest of Mabbug) he
               pursued Greek studies in his youth at the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Qenneshre</ref>
               (on the Euphrates) and became a monk in the monastery of Tarʿil (in the same region),
               subsequently Bp. of Mabbug. He was expelled from his see by the Chalcedonians and
               fled to Alexandria (Egypt) where he translated the NT. His Greek education qualified
               him not only for the translation work but also to serve his Church on the
               ‘ecumenical’ scene. He doubtless could speak Greek fluently and was engaged in the
               negotiations with the Egyptian (Coptic) Miaphysites and with the Chalcedonians.</p>
                    <p>His life is linked with Dometianus (ca. 550–602), the nephew of the Byzantine emperor
               Maurice (582–602), who was appointed Chalcedonian Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref> (Malatya) by his uncle in ca. 580. In 598/99 this Dometianus
               started a persecution of the Miaphysites in the Orient, which made Tumo and other
               bps. (among whom was possibly <ref rend="bold">Pawlos of Tella</ref>) flee to the <ref rend="bold">Enaton</ref>, a monastic district nine miles outside of Alexandria
               (Michael, Chronicle, X,23 = vol. 4, 386). We do not know if he returned after the
               death of Dometianus when the Persians invaded the Byz. East and favoured the
               Miaphysites (but also the Ch. of E.) by expelling the Chalcedonian bishops (Bar
               ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, I,50 = vol. 1, col. 265; Michael, Chronicle, X,25 =
               vol. 4, 391).</p>
                    <p>In 615–6 he was at the Enaton, now linked with his Patr. <ref rend="bold">Athanasios I
                  Gamolo</ref> of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> (594–631). Tumo was his ‘Synkellos’
               and diplomat who shared his efforts to reunite with the Egyptian (Coptic) Miaphysites
               after decades of schism dating from the time of his predecessor <ref rend="bold">Peter
                  of Kallinikos</ref> (581–91). The exile of the Syriac bishops in Egypt during the
               persecution might have invited the Miaphysites to reunite, but the actual
               negotiations were initiated by the Byzantine notable Nicetas and favoured by the
               Emperor Heraclius (610– 641) for political reasons. After the reunion of the Coptic
               and Syrian Miaphysites succeeded in 616 (Bar ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, I,50 =
               vol. 1, col. 269; Michael, Chronicle, X,26 = vol. 4, 392–9; ‘History of the Patr.’,
               ed. B. Evetts, 480–3), Athanasios gave an extensive report to Bp. Quryaqos of <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref> (Diyarbakır). This letter (Michael, Chronicle, X,26 = vol. 4,
               392–9) reveals that both Patr. were not present in person and that Tumo was appointed
               speaker of the Syrians and charged with the negotiations.</p>
                    <p>When the Persians conquered Egypt and devastated the Enaton (619/20), Tumo and his
               version escaped destruction. After 627 the Persian power faded, and the victorious
               Emperor Heraclius was in a strong position when in 631 he met with Athanasios and
               twelve of his bishops (Tumo among them, according to Michael) at Mabbug to discuss a
               christological formula for union (Bar ʿEbroyo, Ecclesiastical History, I,50 = vol. 1,
               col. 271–73; Michael, Chronicle, XI,3 = vol. 4, 409–10). But no agreement was
               reached, and severe restrictions for the Miaphysites followed. In those days Tumo was
               about sixty years old, he died ca. 640. An anonymous Syriac account of Tumo’s life
               (Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, vol. 2, 90–2) confuses him with Tumo of
               Germanicea of the 6th cent.</p>

                    <p>Properly speaking, Ṭur ʿAbdin (‘Mountain of the servants’) does not include the whole
               province of <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> in Turkey, but only the limestone plateau in
               the eastern part of it, between the river Tigris and <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>.
               The first bp. of Ṭur ʿAbdin resided at Ḥaḥ, a town in the north-east of Ṭur ʿAbdin,
               far from the center of the diocese. Ḥaḥ used to be much bigger than it is today, as
               the surrounding ruins and the ancient, relatively large basilica testify. Perhaps,
               its prosperity derived from trade across the Tigris in the period when Rome had
               provinces east of that river. If so, its decline may have begun with the loss of
               those provinces in 363. The <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</ref> later took
               over from Ḥaḥ as the center of the diocese. In 613 Daniel ʿUzoyo became bp. of the
               united dioceses of Dara and Ṭur ʿAbdin, to which, for a while, were added those of
               Tella and <ref rend="bold">Reshʿayna</ref>. This must have been a direct consequence of
               the Persian reconquest of Syria and Egypt. Thirty-five years after burning the
               Monastery of Qarṭmin in 570, the Persians took the Castle of ṬurʿAbdin (Qalʿat
               al-Haytam) in 605. The first idea of the conquerors seems to have been to bring in
               bishops from the Persian Ch. of E., but the bp. they placed in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> was rejected as a ‘Nestorian’ heretic; so they gave power instead to
               the Syr. Orth., a sect persecuted by the Roman Emperors in the 6th cent., who could
               therefore be relied on not to help Byzantium. As far as the Christian population was
               concerned, the situation remained unchanged under the Arabs and subsequent Muslim
               rulers.</p>
                    <p>Daniel (615–24) was given four dioceses, which probably means that the Syr. Orth.
               were much depleted by persecution at the time, especially in the cities, where
               imperial policing had been easier. He was abbot of Qarṭmin and that monastery now
               became the center of the diocese of Ṭur ʿAbdin. Monasteries had been the centers of
               resistance to the Council of Chalcedon (451).</p>
                    <p>In 1088/9 the diocese of Ṭur ʿAbdin was divided. After 450 years in abeyance, Ḥaḥ
               again became the episcopal see; but the bishops of Ṭur ʿAbdin now resided at <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Ṣalīb</ref>. A memorial inscribed shortly after this date at
               Qarṭmin has been read as an attempt to prevent the new bp. in the north-east of Ṭur
               ʿAbdin from claiming all the bishops of the region as his predecessors. If that is
               right, then the Monastery of Qarṭmin must have felt the division as a heavy blow to
               its prestige.</p>
                    <p>On 6 Aug. 1364, with the support of the other bishops of Ṭur ʿAbdin, the bp. of
               Ṣalaḥ, who resided in the Monastery of Mor Yaʿqub, outside that village, received a
               diploma from the Ayyubid ruler of Ḥesno d-Kifo, recognizing him as Patr. of Ṭur
               ʿAbdin. He had been excommunicated by Ishmaʿil, the Patr. of
                  <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, who resided near Mardin. During the 475 years which
               followed, there were five reconciliations between the two patriarchates, ending with
               that of 1839. In this time the custom arose of appointing a <ref rend="bold">Maphrian</ref> (or Catholicos) for the eastern part of Ṭur ʿAbdin. The most
               famous of these Maphrians was <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun II</ref> of Beth Manʿem, a
               prolific writer in Syriac and Kurdish, whose works are still copied in Ṭur
               ʿAbdin.</p>
                    <p>With the exception of <ref rend="bold">Masʿūd</ref>, a 15th-cent. mystical writer who
               lived in Ṭur ʿAbdin, the later history of the region is one long list of raids, wars,
               droughts, famines, plagues, and persecutions. For example, in 1200 the bp. of Qarṭmin
               was suffocated in the cave of Bar Siqay by the Mongol Hunnish raiders, together with
               thirty-two monks and 330 ordinary people; in 1405 and 1413 there were devastating
               epidemics in Ṭur ʿAbdin; and in the 1490s all the monasteries of Ṭur ʿAbdin were laid
               waste by a confederation of Kurdish tribes. This is a small part of all that the
               people of Ṭur ʿAbdin have suffered and survived. From the 13th cent. until the 20th
               they had Yezidis from Iraq as their neighbours and companions in persecution. In
               1895, when the Ottoman Sultan ordered an attack on the Armenians, Ṭur ʿAbdin was
               spared. The region was not so fortunate in 1915, when it suffered a similar blow,
               from which the Christian villages never recovered. This year is remembered as <ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref> (‘the Sword’). They suffered again for their involvement in
               the Kurdish uprising of 1926, particularly in the diocese of Beth Rishe, where the
               Monastery of Mor Malke was destroyed. It was restored in 1955 and is still
               functioning, as are the monasteries of Ṣalaḥ (Mor Yaʿqub) and Qarṭmin (Mor
               Gabriel).</p>
                    <p>Whether or not the Christian remnant in Ṭur ʿAbdin proves to be sustainable, the
               churches and monasteries, if they are not neglected by the authorities, will survive
               as evidence of the importance of the region in the late Roman period. Bp. Shemʿun of
                  <ref rend="bold">Ḥarran</ref> (died 734), who was from the village of Habsenas, made
               his native Ṭur ʿAbdin prosperous once more with investments in the busy city of
               Nisibis; some of the surviving churches (including the church of the Monastery of Mor
               Yaʿqub at Ṣalaḥ, as may be inferred from the original position of the building
               inscription discovered by S. R. Palmer) were renovated from the foundations in the
               early Islamic period, circumventing the ban on new church buildings.</p>

               These texts are in several different languages and are often bilingual. At present

                    <p>There are said to be 400–500 small fragments in Syriac (Gillman and Klimkeit 1999,
               251), very few of which have yet been published. They probably range in date from 9th
               to 12th/13th cent. Besides some biblical fragments, there are many liturgical ones;
               these include some of the earliest witnesses to the <hi rend="italic">Ḥudrā</hi> (ET,
               from Sachau’s edition of 1905, in P. Y. Saeki, <hi rend="italic">The Nestorian 
                  Documents and Relics in China</hi> [1951], 337–47). Hagiographical texts include
               the Acts of St. George, and the Life of Barshabba, first bp. of Merv. Otherwise
               unknown texts include a dialogue between a Jew and a Christian, and a historical
               narrative concerning <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>. Two non-literary texts have been
               published (by Maroth), both in Serṭo and dating from ca. 10th cent.: one contains
               recipes for medical concoctions (one is against loss of hair), while the other is a
               draft of a letter, evidently to a high Byzantine official, written in very florid
               language.</p>
                    <p>Bilingual texts are liturgical (mostly NT lectionary texts and Psalms). The majority
               are Syriac and <ref rend="bold">Sogdian</ref> (in alternating sentences, or with
               opening Syriac words only), but there is also one Syriac and New Persian (Psalms),
               several Syriac and Uighur-Turkish, and (surprisingly) one Greek and Sogdian,
               suggesting the presence of Melkites, too.</p>
                    <p>The great majority of the Christian texts are in Sogdian, and all are evidently
               translations from Syriac. Among the biblical (almost all, NT lectionaries) and
               liturgical texts are the Nicene Creed (in a Psalms ms., anticipating later usage),
               the <hi rend="italic">Gloria in excelsis</hi>, an early form of a commentary on
               Baptism and the Eucharist, known in both E.- and W.- Syr. tradition, and a verse text
               by <ref rend="bold">Babai of Nisibis</ref> (‘On the final evil hour’, not extant in
               Syriac). Hagiography is well represented, with fragments of the following: Barshabba,
               Cyriacus and Julitta, Eugenius, Eustathius, Finding of the Cross, <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan of Dailam</ref>, Acts of Peter, Pethion, Sarapion, Sergius and Bacchus,
               four martyrdoms under Shapur II (Shahdost, Tarbo, 120 martyrs, and Barbaʿshmin), and
               the <ref rend="bold">Sleepers of Ephesus</ref>. Also prominent are monastic texts,
               which include <ref rend="bold">Evagrius</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">Antirrheticus</hi>,
                  <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ</ref>’s Commentaries on <ref rend="bold">Isaiah of
                  Scetis</ref> and the Paradise of the Fathers, some Sayings of the Fathers, and
               some unidentified texts, including parts of a homily on the three periods of the
               solitary life.</p>
                    <p>In Middle Persian there is one fragment of a Psalter, and some forty or more in
               Uighur Turkish; these include a fragment on St. George (ed. W. Bang, in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>39 [1926]).</p>
                    <p>In contrast to the ms. finds from the Turfan area, Syriac is barely represented at
               all at Dunhuang, further east: only two fragments have so far come to light, one of a
               Pauline Lectionary (W. Klein and J. Tubach, in <hi rend="italic">ZDMG</hi> 144
               [1994], 1–3; cf. H. Kaufhold, in <hi rend="italic">ZDMG</hi> 146 [1996], 49–60), and
               the other of a Psalter (D. Qing, in <hi rend="italic">OC</hi> 87 [2001], 84–93). Two
               Syriac fragments of liturgical texts were also found at Kara Khoto, a center of the
               Tangut (N. Pigulevskaya, in <hi rend="italic">ROC</hi> 30 [1938], 3–46).</p>

                    <p>Ṭuroyo is the collective name for the various Modern Syriac dialects used in <ref rend="bold">Ṭur ʿAbdin</ref>. Its place within the spectrum of Modern Aramaic is
               closer to the numerous North Eastern Neo-Aramaic dialects than to the small western
               ones. The earliest texts written in Ṭuroyo belong to the late 19th cent. and were
               often written specifically for the benefit of western scholars (Heinrichs).
               Collections of recorded oral material have been made by Prym and Socin (1881), and
               especially by H. Ritter (3 vols., 1967, 1969, 1971). The wider written use of Ṭuroyo
               belongs to the second half of the 20th cent., starting in Qamishli. More recently in
               the <ref rend="bold">diaspora</ref> it sometimes features in cultural magazines, either
               in Syriac script, or in a transcription devised by Dr. Yusuf Ishaq in Sweden. In
               recent years a number of writers have started to use Ṭuroyo as a literary language,
               especially for short stories (notably Jan Sawoce) and children’s books. There is an
               edition of the Four Gospels in Ṭuroyo (1995). There are grammars by A. Siegel (1923),
               O. Jastrow (3rd ed. 1985 [reference grammar]; 1992 [<hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch</hi>]), and H. Ritter (1967–1990), and a number of dictionaries: H. Ritter
               (1979, Ṭuroyo-German); Kyrillus Jacob and Asmar Elkhoury (1985, Suryoyo-Swodoyo), Y.
               Ishaq (1988, Swedish-Ṭuroyo).</p>

                    <p>Urmia (Urūmiyya, Rīzāya), a city in northwest Iran, west of Lake Urmia, is first
               mentioned in E.-Syr. sources in 1111, whereas the mentioning of bishops in Azerbaijan
               (Hoshaʿ of Ganzak in 486, Ḥenanishoʿ in 605), testify to earlier presence of the Ch.
               of E. in this region. In 1284, the Ch. of E. Patr., Mar <ref rend="bold">Yahbalaha
                  III</ref>, reportedly visited the Church of Mart Maryam in Urmia and dreamt about
               the imminent death of Khan Ahmad. From the 16th cent. onwards, bishops of Urmia are
               attested regularly in both western and eastern sources. In the 19th cent., the town
               became the center of western missionary activities in the region: Presbyterian
               missionaries of the American Board (1835), Roman Catholic Lazarist missionaries
               (1841), Lutherans (1881), Anglicans (1886), and Russian Orthodox (1897). Their
               activities contributed to the growth of Catholicism and the birth of an Assyrian
               Protestant (Evangelical) Church in the region, as well as to the strengthening of
               both the Ch. of E.’s and the new churches’ educational and clerical programs. In
               addition, the American mission press initiated the publication of both Classical
               Syriac and Neo-Aramaic texts, among which the first vernacular Bible translations in
               1846 (NT) and 1852 (OT) and the first magazine, <hi rend="italic">Zahrire
                  d-Bahrā</hi> (‘Rays of Light’), in 1849. Towards the end of the 19th  cent., Urmia
               witnessed the birth of <ref rend="bold">Assyrian</ref> nationalism. During the First
               World War, when the region’s Christians were under attack from Kurds and Turks, many
               found refuge in the missionary compounds. In 1918, however, the massive flight from
               Urmia towards the English in northern Iraq, cost many lives. After the war, Assyrian
               Christians returned to Urmia, and whereas most of the villages in the region were
               lost to the Christian population, the town itself remained an important center of
               Assyrian Christians of all denominations in Iran.</p>

                    <p>Professor of Syriac at the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium, from 1969 to
               1974. Born in Lier in 1903, Ceslas (Florent) Van den Eynde entered the Dominican
               Order in 1922 and was ordained a priest in 1928. His doctoral dissertation, submitted
               at the Oriental Institute of the University of Louvain and published in 1939, dealt
               with the Syriac version of the commentary on the Song of Songs by <ref rend="bold">Gregory of Nyssa</ref> (probably ca. 500), and its reception in later Syriac
               tradition.</p>
                    <p>In addition to his teaching and other obligations at the Dominican Seminary in
               Louvain, Van den Eynde worked on the edition and translation of the 9th-cent. OT
               commentaries of <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdad of Merv</ref>, a project begun by his
               Dominican confrère Jacques-Marie Vosté (d.  1948). The critical edition of these
               commentaries, covering more than eleven hundred pages of Syriac text, appeared in six
               volumes between 1950 and 1981. The accompanying six volumes of translation, with
               substantial introductions and annotations, constitute the first systematic study of
               E.-Syr. OT interpretation. This seminal work has served as a model and a point of
               reference for all subsequent studies in the field. It was only at a later age that
               Van den Eynde was appointed professor of Syriac in the newly created Dutch-speaking
               Oriental Institute, following the division of the University of Louvain in 1968.</p>

                    <p>Patristic and Syriac scholar. Born in Vorselaar, in the Flemish countryside of
               Belgium, Van Roey studied at the Seminary of Malines (Mechelen) and at the Catholic
               University of Louvain. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1939. In spite of the
               restrictions imposed by the war, he continued his study at Louvain, focusing on
               Arabic, which he studied with G. Ryckmans, and on Syriac, with J. Lebon. His doctoral
               dissertation in theology (1945) dealt with an 8th-cent. Syriac letter, written by a
               certain <ref rend="bold">Eliya</ref> in defense of his recent conversion from the
               Chalcedonian to the Syr. Orth. Church. Three years later, after a period of study in
               Paris, where he met <ref rend="bold">J.-B. Chabot</ref>, Van Roey defended his doctoral
               dissertation in ‘Eastern Philology and History’ (1948), which was on <ref rend="bold">Nonos of Nisibis</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Van Roey was appointed professor at the University of Louvain in 1949 and taught
               patristics and Eastern Christianity. Following the division of the University in
               1968, he played an important role in reorganizing both the Faculty of Theology and
               the Oriental Institute of the Dutch speaking university. In the latter institute
               (later department) he taught Arabic and, for some time, Syriac and Armenian. He was
               co-founder of the periodical <hi rend="italic">Orientalia Lovaniensia Periodica</hi>
               (1970) and of the serial publications <hi rend="italic">Orientalia Lovaniensia
                  Analecta</hi> (1975) and <hi rend="italic">Corpus Christianorum, Series
                  Graeca</hi> (1977).</p>
                    <p>With a wide-ranging interest in history and theology, Van Roey focused on theological
               literature either originally written in Syriac or translated from Greek. Many of his
               projects, begun during his busy years as professor and university administrator, came
               to full fruition after his retirement in 1983. Among his publications, the edition
               and translation of 6th-cent. theological writings (with P.  Allen), of <ref rend="bold">Peter of Kallinikos</ref> (with R. Y.  Ebied and L. R.  Wickham), of Eliya, and
               of Nonos are particularly noteworthy. He also did important work on the 16th-cent.
               Syriac scholar <ref rend="bold">Andreas Masius</ref>. While fully committed to the
               Flemish cause in Belgium, Van Roey’s academic languages were Latin and French. It was
               only in later years and in the context of international collaboration that he began
               to use English. A Festschrift was offered to him in 1985 (ed. C.  Laga et al.).</p>

                    <p>Vaschalde’s Syriac career flourished at The Catholic University of America (CUA)
               where he received a Ph. D. in 1901. His dissertation, an edition, translation, and
               study of three letters of <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>, was published in
               1902. Vaschalde taught Syriac and Coptic at CUA from 1910 to 1939. His work on the
               Coptic versions of the Bible remains an important resource for scholars today. In
               1930 he became the editor for the Coptic section of the Corpus Scriptorum
               Christianorum Orientalium (CSCO). Most of his Syriac publications appear in this
               series, including editions and translations of writings of Philoxenos of Mabbug, <ref rend="bold">Babai the Great</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Edessa</ref>, and <ref rend="bold">Dionysios bar Ṣalibi</ref>.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Scholar, educator, pastor. Vööbus was born in Vera, Estonia and educated at the
               University of Tartu. Ordained in 1932, he served (1933–40) as pastor of St. Paul
               Lutheran Church in Tartu. His encounter with Syriac mss. at the Staatsbibliothek in
               Berlin (1935) filled him with ‘reverent awe’ and precipitated a lifelong search for
               ancient documents. When his homeland was overrun alternately by the Russian and
               German armies, he twice fled to Germany, barely escaping arrest by the Soviets (1940
               and 1944), only to be interned (with his wife Ilse) by the Nazis (1941) for his
               opposition to fascism.</p>
                    <p>After earning his doctorate (1943), Vööbus taught first as assistant professor of
               Ancient Church History at the University of Tartu (1943–44), and then (1946–48) as
               associate professor at the Baltic University at Hamburg-Pinneberg in Germany, where
               he also provided pastoral care (1944–48) in the refugee camps. The Lutheran Seminary
               in Chicago (now the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago) offered him (1948) the
               chair of New Testament and Early Church History, a position which he held until his
               retirement in 1977. During his retirement he continued to teach part-time at LSTC, to
               travel in search of oriental mss., to publish, and to lecture as visiting professor
               of Syriac language and literature at the Oriental Institute of the University of
               Chicago.</p>
                    <p>Vööbus led an enormously productive life. During his more than forty expeditions to
               the Near East his relentless search in dozens of monastery libraries and private
               collections in Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, and in other places, enabled him to
               access over 2,000 rare mss., most of which had been unknown in the west or were
               thought to have been lost. He captured more than 150,000 pages of the most
               significant mss. on microfilm. This precious ms. collection is still kept at LSTC,
               though it is now administered by the Oriental Institute of the University of
               Chicago.</p>
                    <p>Vööbus’ own studies of these important documents resulted in the writing of more than
               80 monographs and some 300 articles in international journals in English, French,
               German, and Estonian. Twenty-six of these monographs appeared in the series CSCO.
               Through these endeavours, Vööbus vastly expanded the store of available original
               sources and initiated new areas of investigation in the field of ancient Syriac
               Christianity and beyond.</p>
                    <p>Among the wide range of topics covered in Vööbus’ publications, the following main
               areas may be singled out: the Syriac text of the <ref rend="bold">Bible</ref> (both OT
               and NT); Syriac asceticism; the <ref rend="bold">Didascalia Apostolorum</ref>; <ref rend="bold">juridical literature</ref> primarily of the W.-Syr. tradition; the
               transmission of the <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of
                  Serugh</ref>; and the <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Always the devoted patriot, Vööbus also did much to preserve the memory of the
               history and culture of the Estonian people, publishing 14 volumes (1969–85) in the
               series Studies in the History of the Estonian People (SHEP), a sub-series within his
               40-volume series Papers of the Estonian Theological Society in Exile (PETSE), which
               he had inaugurated in 1951 as a monument to the vigour of Lutheran scholarship in
               Estonia. Himself a victim of persecution, Vööbus held that a scholar has the duty to
               speak out as ‘a voice for the voiceless in suffering’. As such he wrote countless
               open letters, tractates, etc. warning against the dangers of communism. The extant
               bibliographies make only passing reference to this passionate advocacy on his
               part.</p>
                    <p>Professor Vööbus was elected to a number of learned societies, among them L’Académie
               Internationale Libre des Sciences et des Lettres (Paris), L’Académie Royale des
               Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique, The American Philosophical
               Society, and the Syriac Academy of Baghdad.</p>

                    <p>Syriac-speaking Christians painted their churches throughout their long history. In
               the Early Christian period, these paintings closely followed the style and
               iconography of painting in Constantinople. In the city of Resafa, Syria, built by
               Justinian in the 6th cent., remains of wall paintings are well preserved in the
               soffits of the windows of the Cathedral and a large cross was painted in the apse of
               a side chapel. The remains of an Adoration of the Magi from the 6th cent. are visible
               in the Cathedral of <ref rend="bold">Bostra</ref>, in the Ḥawrān (S. Syria). A
               remarkable painting of the Enthroned Christ with angels still adorns the Temple of
               Bel in Palmyra, which was used as a Christian church. There are many other examples
               not so well preserved.</p>
                    <p>Following the Arab conquests, Christians continued to paint their churches and these
               paintings were reportedly much admired, even by Muslims. When <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref> fell to the Crusaders in 1099, eastern Christians, both within
               the occupied lands and outside of them, experienced what Leroy calls a ‘Renaissance’
               in all aspects of their religious and cultural life (see <ref rend="bold">Renaissance,
                  Syriac</ref>). This growth is evident in their painted churches.</p>
                    <p>Fine paintings from the late 12th cent. adorn the walls of the Church of Sts. Sergios
               and Bacchos in <ref rend="bold">Qara</ref>, Syria, and in the nearby Dayro d-Mor
               Yaʿqub. The little church of Mar Elian in <ref rend="bold">Ḥimṣ</ref> still preserves
               paintings that have been damaged by recent restoration. There is an account of
               painters from the monastery of Mar Elian, in Qaryatayn, who came to paint churches in
               Lebanon and paintings have been restored in the chapel of Maʿarrat Ṣaydnāyā, near
                  <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref>. Wall paintings from the 13th  cent. also remain in
               the castles of Marqab and Crac des Chevaliers. Although the paintings in the castles
               were commissioned by the Crusaders, there is every indication that they were painted
               by local painters, trained in the Syr. tradition. The best preserved of the paintings
               in Syria are in <ref rend="bold">Dayr Mār Mūsā al-Ḥabashī</ref>, near Nabk (Syr.
               Orth.), where the walls of the chapel were elaborately painted on at least four
               different occasions in the 11th and 12th/13th cent.</p>
                    <p>By the end of the 12th cent., Christians of different communities, Syr. Orth., Ch. of
               E., Maron., Chald., Syr. Cath., Melk., and even Abyssinians and Copts had moved into
               Lebanon to profit from new opportunities in trade and commerce offered by the
               Crusader states. The liturgies of many of these churches in Lebanon were in Syriac.
               Fragments of church painting from the late 12th and 13th cent. in the mountains of
               Lebanon witness to a continuing tradition of church decoration during this period. In
               both Syria and Lebanon, the earlier paintings are inscribed in Greek, whereas by the
               13th cent. the common language for the inscriptions was Syriac (mostly in
               Esṭrangela), Arabic (often in <ref rend="bold">Garshuni</ref>), or a combination of
               both.</p>
                    <p>Churches decorated with outstanding paintings in Lebanon are the Church of Mar Phocas
               in <ref rend="bold">Amyūn</ref>, Mar Saba in <ref rend="bold">Eddé</ref>, Mar Tadros in
                  <ref rend="bold">Bahdeidat</ref>, Mar Charbel in <ref rend="bold">Maʿad</ref>, and<ref rend="bold"/>Sts. Sergios and Bacchos<ref rend="bold"/>in <ref rend="bold">Kaftun</ref>.
               In addition, there are more than two dozen churches with fragmentary remains of
               painting on the walls. These paintings are all in the north of Lebanon, centered
               around the rich commercial area of Tripoli, in the Holy Valley of the Qadisha in the
               Lebanon range and in the lower foothills around Byblos and Batrun. Some of these
               paintings were hidden for many years under a coating of whitewash. Others remain
               untouched in the hermit caves by the river and under the cliffs of the Qadisha Gorge.
               Taken all together, they present an overview of the varied painterly tradition during
               the Crusader occupation, a tradition that survived into the Mamluk period. Paintings
               still exist also from the 16th and — until very recently — the 17th cent. Some of
               these paintings were destroyed in the last few years but have been recorded. The
               remainder are in precarious condition.</p>
                    <p>In Syria, this tradition of Christian painting was continued during Muslim rule. In
               Lebanon, the paintings indicate the rich and continuing tradition of Christian art in
               lands dominated by Crusaders. Both traditions are evidence of a flourishing Christian
               society that acted as liaison between Arabs and Franks. In this cultural
               ‘Renaissance’, the Syr. Orth. were especially prominent. In the 12th and 13th cent.
               they moved into Lebanon from the outlying areas of Damascus, <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>, Diyarbakır (<ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>), and <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, in order to occupy the monasteries behind Tripoli, taking over many
               Maronite establishments. The Mamluks allowed them to prosper in Lebanon, and they
               were joined by a further influx of monks from lands as distant as Abyssinia. By the
               end of the 15th cent., especially after 1488, the Maronites had assumed control of
               the Qadisha Valley and the adjacent mountainous areas. These areas remain largely
               Maronite today.</p>

                    <p>Syriac Christianity from the beginning allotted women important positions as widows,
               deaconesses, and consecrated virgins; these roles were canonically named,
               ecclesiastically supervised, and granted significant responsibilities by the 3rd
               cent. Syriac churches also developed distinctive roles for women that differed from
               other Christian areas. Notable was the office of Covenanter, or Sons and Daughters of
               the Covenant (<hi rend="italic">bnay</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bnāt qyāmā</hi>; see
                  <ref rend="bold">bnay qyāmā</ref>), which appears during the 3rd cent. and continues
               at least into the 10th in both W.- and E.-Syr. churches. These were men and women who
               had taken vows of celibacy and simplicity, working in the service of the local bp.
               The rise of institutionalized <ref rend="bold">monasticism</ref> in the 4th cent. did
               not eclipse their work. For the women, this office included the crucial task of
               singing doctrinal hymns (<hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi>) in the liturgy of the civic
               churches. Later tradition ascribes the establishment of these women’s choirs to <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> himself.</p>
                    <p>No known Syriac text written by a woman survives until modern times, although the
               large corpus of anonymous Syriac hymnography and <ref rend="bold">hagiography</ref> may
               include women’s contributions. Important Syriac women saints, both historical and
               legendary, gained renown in the Greek and Latin churches and sometimes beyond:
               Pelagia the Harlot of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>, Mary the Niece of Abraham of
               Qidun, and Febronia of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref> are among the best known.
               Furthermore, biblical women were often prominent in Syriac hymns and homilies, with
               stories much elaborated beyond the biblical text. Appreciation for the
               interconnection between biblical women and female saints may be seen in the Syriac
               ‘Book of Women’, containing the biblical books of Ruth, Esther, Judith, and Susanna
               as well as the ‘Book of Thecla’ (from the ‘Acts of Paul and Thecla’).</p>
                    <p>Additionally, ancient Syriac tradition produced striking feminine imagery for the
               divine, especially for the Holy Spirit (following grammar: <hi rend="italic">ruḥā
               </hi>‘spirit’, being a feminine noun in Syriac). Perhaps related, devotion to the
               Virgin <ref rend="bold">Mary</ref> was profoundly developed from an early stage in
               Syriac, anticipating by a century and more similar developments in Greek and Latin
               communities.</p>
                    <p>Female monasticism flourished in late antique Syriac Christianity, with an apparent
               encouragement of women’s literacy and learning. These declined quickly under Islamic
               domination, until modern times. Already in the early modern period, there is evidence
               of women’s leadership and patronage of religious learning in E.-Syr. communities. The
               holy woman Hindiyya, an 18th cent. Maronite nun in Lebanon, produced lengthy mystical
               writings in Arabic; the 20th cent. brought the renewal of Syriac women’s monastic
               communities in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. In the 21st cent., both E.- and W.-Syr.
               women’s choirs have undergone significant revival, with enhanced liturgical roles
               and, in Europe and Sweden, annual competitions and celebrations of their
               chanting.</p>

               University (Scotland), and subsequently studied at Halle with Emil Rödiger, and at
               Leiden with R. Dozy. He was appointed Professor of Arabic at University College,
               London in 1885, moving the next year to a similar chair at Trinity College, Dublin,
               where he remained till 1861, when he was appointed to a post in the British Museum,
               in order to catalogue the large collection of Syriac mss. acquired from <ref rend="bold">Dayr al-Suryān</ref>. Finally, in 1870, he was appointed as Sir Thomas

               periodically from the 11th cent. BC through the Tang Dynasty (AD 618–907). By 635 the
               E.-Syr. missionary known as Aluoben had received permission from the Chinese emperor
               Taizong (627–49) to promote the Ch. of E. in his kingdom, using the capital as a
               base. The Christian movement appears to have flourished alongside other religions
               under a sort of imperial patronage until a Confucianist and Taoist repression against
               foreign religions occurred in the late Tang (ca. 846).</p>
                    <p>A black limestone stele inscribed in Syriac and Chinese by the Christian monk
               Jingjing (Syr. Adam) and dedicated in 781 was originally erected at the site of a Ch.
               of E. monastery, probably in the capital but possibly at a more remote location. It
               tells of Aluoben’s mission and the story of Christianity’s illustrious growth in
               China since 635. The Syriac inscription gives the names of 74 bishops, presbyters,
               and deacons working in China at the time; the Chinese inscription expounds on the
               Christian faith, using terms adapted to the Buddhist- and Taoist-influenced setting.
               Jesuit missionaries discovered the stele in 1623 or 1625 and exploited its antiquity
               for the promotion of Christianity in their own mission efforts. The content of the
               inscription has stimulated lively missiological discussion regarding the historical
               and appropriate contextualization of the Christian gospel.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Seleucia-Ctesiphon</ref> and Cath. When Yahbalaha was elected,
               the Christians in the Persian Empire enjoyed the freedom accorded to them by Emperor
               Yazdgard I and formally laid down in the Synod of <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq</ref> (410).
               This situation of tolerance must have continued under Isḥaq’s successor, Cath. Aḥai
               (410–15), about whom very little is known. Our main source about Yahbalaha’s tenure
               is the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>, which includes an account of the
               synod held in 419 or 420, shortly before Yahbalaha’s and Yazdgard’s death (420).
               Prior to the synod, Yahbalaha had been sent by Yazdgard as an ambassador to the Roman
               Empire ‘for the peace and the reconciliation of the two empires, which are the robust
               shoulders of the world’. The Roman Emperor (Theodosius II) responded to Yahbalaha’s
               mission by sending Aqaq of <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref> to Persia. It is during Aqaq’s
               presence in the Persian capital that the synod was held, Aqaq playing a role similar
               to the one <ref rend="bold">Marutha of Maypherqaṭ</ref> played at the synod of 410.</p>
                    <p>One important concern of the synod was to boost conformity among Christians in the
               two empires by adopting the canons issued at various synods in the Roman Empire. In
               the account of the synod it is said that the process of adjustment between the
               Christian communities in the two empires, begun in 410, had not been completed and
               that division and confusion had arisen. Since the account does not include canons, it
               cannot be ascertained which new rules were introduced, even though there is reason to
               assume that on this occasion Greek canonical collections were in fact brought to the
               Ch. of E. The fact that only twelve signatures are found (as compared to the 38
               signatures for the 410 synod) may indicate that the synod was not widely supported.
               Its limited success may also be due to Yazdgard’s changing attitude toward the
               Christians and to the resumption of persecution around 419. This was a prelude to
               renewed warfare between the two empires (421–22) and created an atmosphere of crisis,
               in which Yahbalaha’s successor <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ</ref> convened the synod of
               424.</p>

                    <p>Mar Yahbalaha III, an ethnic Uighur and a monk of the Ch. of E., was born in the
               vicinity of Khān Bālīq (Beijing). As a young monk, he took the name Markos and became
               devoted to his spiritual master, <ref rend="bold">Ṣawma</ref>. Sometime around 1275 the
               two of them set out on a pilgrimage with the intention of visiting <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>. In spite of travel permits from Kublai Khan, the two encountered
               numerous difficulties before reaching <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> and meeting with
               the Cath. of the Ch. of E., Mar Denḥa. When the Cath. died (1281), Markos was chosen
               as his successor and took the name Mar Yahbalaha III. His electors may have hoped
               that by raising someone from the East to the patriarchal throne they would gain some
               advantage with their Mongol overlords.</p>
                    <p>Mar Yahbalaha is remembered for his efforts to establish diplomatic contacts with the
               Mongols and for his defense of the Ch. of E. against harassment and massacres by
               local Muslim rulers. Despite valiant efforts, Yahbalaha witnessed the decimation of
               his Church. A particularly savage massacre of Christians took place at Arbil (<ref rend="bold">Arbela</ref>). These sad events in the history of the Ch. of E. were
               recorded by Ṣawma who also kept a record of his diplomatic mission to Christian
               Europe. The story of Mar Yahbalaha first became known in the English-speaking world
               in 1928. In that year the British orientalist E. A. Wallis Budge published his <hi rend="italic">Monks of Kublai Khan, Emperor of China</hi>.</p>

                    <p>Translator, philosopher, logician, and theologian. His full name is Abū Zakariyyā
               Yaḥyā b. ʿAdī b. Ḥamīd b. Zakariyyā (some mss. copied in Iran add: b. Yaḥyā b.
               ʿUthmān b. Ḥamīd b. Buzurjmihr). He was born in 893/4 in <ref rend="bold">Tagrit
               </ref>and spent most of his adult life in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref>. He died 13
               Aug. 974 at the age of 81 and was buried in the church of Mār Tūmā in Baghdad. He was
               a student of the Ch. of E. philosopher Abū Bishr Mattā b. Yūnus (d. ca. 940) and the
               celebrated Muslim philosopher Abū Naṣr al-Fārābī (d. ca. 950). Yaḥyā had a number of
               prominent students, both Christians and Muslims. His Christian students include Abū
               ʿAlī ʿĪsā b. Zurʿa (d. 1008) and al-Ḥasan b. Suwār b. al-Khammār (d. after 1017), the
               latter of whom instructed <ref rend="bold">Ibn al-Ṭayyib</ref>(d. 1043). His Muslim
               students include Abū Sulaymān al-Sijistānī (d. ca. 985), ʿĪsā b. ʿAlī (d. 1001; to be
               distinguished from the Syriac lexicographer <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿ bar ʿAli</ref>), and
               Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī (d. 1023). Like his contemporary Ibn al-Nadīm (fl. 987), who
               wrote the <hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-Fihrist</hi>, Yaḥyā was a professional scribe
               and bookseller in Baghdad. He is, however, better known as the master of philosophy
               of his time.</p>
                    <p>Yaḥyā’s <hi rend="italic">oeuvre</hi>includes more than 130 items, all in Arabic,
               thatspan the fields of philosophy, logic, metaphysics, ethics, physics and
               mathematics, and theology (an indispensible inventory is provided by Endress 1977
               with important additions and corrections by Samir 1979). Following in the tradition
               of <ref rend="bold">Ḥunayn b. Isḥāq</ref> (d. 873), Yaḥyā edited, translated (often via
               Syriac), and commented on many Greek philosophical texts. Chief among these were the
               works of <ref rend="bold">Aristotle</ref>, especially the ‘Topics’ and ‘Physics’. Yaḥyā
               was, however, also an author in his own right. One of his more important works is his
                  <hi rend="italic">Maqāl fī al-tawḥīd</hi>‘Discourse on unity’ (ed. Kh.  Samir
               1980), in which he defines the unity of God in such a way as to affirm monotheism
               (important to his Muslim audience) while maintaining three attributes of God, namely
               goodness, wisdom, and power (pointing to a Trinitarian understanding of God). In
               addition to his writings on logic and philosophy, Yaḥyā was a prolific author in
               Christian theology with many of his works being of an apologetic nature. Some of his
               apologetic writings are directed against the Muslim <hi rend="italic">mutakallimūn</hi> with whom he was in regular contact (see <ref rend="bold">Islam,
                  Syriac contacts with</ref>). Yaḥyā, for instance, wrote a lengthy response to the
                  <hi rend="italic">Kitāb fī al-radd ʿalā al-firaq al-thalāth min al-naṣārā
               </hi>‘Refutation of the three sects of the Christians’ by Abū ʿĪsā Muḥammad b. Hārūn
               al-Warrāq (d. ca. 862) (ed. Platti 1987). Yaḥyā also wrote apologetic works against
               the Ch. of E. in which he defended the Christological formulation of the Syr. Orth.
               Church (see, e.g., Platti 1981–1982, 1983). Finally, mention should be made of
                  Yaḥyā’s <hi rend="italic">Tahdhīb al-akhlāq</hi>‘The Reformation of Morals’
               (Arabic with ET Griffith 2002), which is one of the earliest and most important works
               on ethics in Arabic literature.</p>

                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Dayro d-Mor Matay</ref> and learned author. Born in <ref rend="bold">Barṭelle</ref>, his baptismal name was probably Yaʿqub. He studied
               grammar under <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan bar Zoʿbi</ref> in the famous E.-Syr. monastery
               of Beth Qoqe (in <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref>), and philosophy under Kāmāl al-Dīn
               Mūsā b. Yūnus at <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>. He was first a monk and subsequently
               abbot and bp. of the Dayro d-Mor Matay, with the episcopal name Severos (according to
               Schrier, however, Severos was his baptismal name and Yaʿqub his episcopal one, but
               this would seem surprising). His surviving writings consist of 1. ‘The Book of
               Treasures’, a theological compendium in four parts, composed in 1231; this covers the
               Trinity, the Incarnation, Divine Providence, and the Creation; 2. ‘The Book of
               Dialogues’, in two Books, the first of which covers grammar, rhetoric, poetry, and
               eloquence (on the richness of the Syriac language), while the second deals with
               philosophical topics, divided into two parts, the first covering logic and
               syllogisms, the second with sections on definitions, ethics, physics and physiology,
               mathematics and music, and metaphysics; 3. two verse letters addressed to physicians;
               and perhaps 4. a symbol of faith. He also wrote some other works, now lost; these
               included a commentary on the liturgical services.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (542–78) and missionary. Born in Tella, and
               educated in the nearby monastery of Phesilta. In 527/8 he was sent to Constantinople
               to look after the interests of the Miaphysites. In Constantinople Justinian’s wife
                  <ref rend="bold">Theodora</ref> had put the Palace of Hormisdas at the disposal of
               the considerable number of Miaphysite refugees who had gathered there. In 542/3, when
               the Ghassanid leader, Ḥārith b. Gabala, asked Theodora for some bishops to look after
               the non-Chalcedonian commmunities, Yaʿqub and Theodore were secretly consecrated in
               Constantinople by <ref rend="bold">Theodosius</ref>, Patr. of Alexandria, and were
               designated as bishops of Edessa and of (the Ghassanid) <ref rend="bold">Ḥirta</ref>.
               Yaʿqub subsequently played an important role in providing for the pastoral needs of
               Miaphysite communities all over the Near East; often pursued by the imperial
               authorities, he travelled in disguise, whence his nickname <hi rend="italic">burdʿoyo</hi> ‘(dressed in) saddle-cloth’, Hellenized as <hi rend="italic">Baradaios</hi> (the back formation of ‘Bar Adai’ is due to a modern
               misinterpretation). Towards the end of his life he was much involved in the
               opposition to <ref rend="bold">Pawlos of Beth Ukomo</ref> (Paul ‘the Black’; Patr. from
               564 to 577) and in the ‘Tritheist’ controversy.</p>
                    <p>The two main biographical accounts are: 1. <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>’
               ‘Lives of Eastern Saints’, ch. 49–50 (ed. Brooks, <hi rend="italic">PO</hi> 18,
               488–95 and <hi rend="italic">PO</hi> 19, 499–504); and 2. a longer anonymous Life
               (also in Brooks, <hi rend="italic">PO</hi> 19, 574–614). The latter in particular
               attributes to him an exaggerated number of ordinations. Writing from a European
               perspective, and influenced by the subsequent hostile designation of the Syr. Orth.
               as ‘Jacobites’, Kleyn described Yaʿqub as ‘the founder of the Monophysite Church’.
               While undoubtedly he played a very important role, along with Theodore, in ensuring
               the survival of the Syriac (and other) communities who were opposed to the imperial
               religious policy which sought to impose the Chalcedonian Definition on the Church, he
               should better be seen as someone motivated primarily by pastoral concerns.</p>
                    <p>Nine letters written by him (sometimes alongside others) are preserved in a ms.
               containing a large number of miaphysite texts (ed. Chabot); other texts under his
               name are an Anaphora, a profession of faith, and a homily on the Annunciation
               preserved only in Arabic translation; the authenticity of the last two, in
               particular, is doubtful (the homily is also transmitted under the name of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Nuḥ the Lebanese</ref>!).</p>
                    <p>His liturgical commemoration is on 31 July.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Bp. of <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref> (ca. 684–9, 708) and scholar. Born in the village
               of ʿEn Deba in the district of Gumya, in the province of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>. He entered the monastery of <ref rend="bold">John bar Aphtonia</ref> in
                  <ref rend="bold">Qenneshre</ref> on the upper Euphrates, where he studied the
               Scriptures and Greek, and spent some years in Alexandria. The remainder of his life
               was spent in the region of Syria which was by then under Muslim control. He was
               ordained by his friend the Patr. <ref rend="bold">Athanasios of Balad</ref> and in ca.
               684 was appointed bp. of Edessa. However, he resigned after only a few years over
               what he regarded as a lax attitude to canon law with which he refused to compromise.
               He made a public demonstration of his position by burning a copy of the canons in
               front of the residence of the Patr. Yulyanos. He then went to the Monastery of Mor
               Yaʿqub at Kaysum, near Samosata, and wrote two treatises, one of them against those
               who broke canon law. Subsequently he was invited to the Monastery of Eusebona to
               teach the Psalms and the reading of Scripture in Greek: although he was a
               Syriac-speaker and wrote exclusively in Syriac, Yaʿqub was an enthusiastic proponent
               of Greek language, literature, and Miaphysite theology. But after eleven years he was
               forced to leave because of the anti-Greek attitude prevalent in the convent. He moved
               on to the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Tell ʿAda</ref> along with his disciples and
               worked on his revision of the Old Testament. In 708 Ḥabbib, who had replaced Yaʿqub
               as bp. of Edessa, died, and Yaʿqub was recalled to the bishopric. However, he himself
               died only four months later on 5 June at Tell ʿAda, to which he had returned in order
               to fetch his library and students. He was buried there, and miracles were said to
               have been performed at his tomb.</p>
                    <p>Yaʿqub was a polymath, and although some of his works have failed to survive, many
               were very influential in the Syr. Orth. Church. His literary works include:</p>
                    <p>1. A revision and annotation of earlier Syriac translations of the Greek ‘Cathedral
               Homilies’ and ‘Oktoechos’ of the Miaphysite scholar <ref rend="bold">Severus of
                  Antioch</ref>. Completed ca. 701.</p>
                    <p>2. Yaʿqub’s ‘Hexaemeron’, the first Syriac work to describe the world from the
               perspective of the biblical creation account. Unfinished at the time of Yaʿqub’s
               death and completed by his friend <ref rend="bold">Giwargi bp. of the Arab
               tribes</ref>.</p>
                    <p>3. Many letters on matters ranging from canon law to bible interpretation. Yaʿqub’s
               correspondents include <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon the Stylite of Litarba</ref> near <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>, Pawlos of Antioch, Eustathios of Dara, Qurisona of Dara,
               the priest Abrohom, the deacon Gewargis, the sculptor Toma, and Barḥadbshabba.</p>
                    <p>4. A revision of the Old Testament text, which survives for the Pentateuch, Sam, Is,
               Dan, and Wisd. It seems to be a hybrid of the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref>,
               Septuagint, and Syro-Hexapla texts, perhaps with the aim of supplementing the Syriac
               tradition.</p>
                    <p>5. Commentaries on the Bible, but these only survive as scholia in catenae and ms.
               collections.</p>
                    <p>6. Works on canon law, including a treatise on the forbidden degrees of affinity.
               Yaʿqub’s interpretations are also found in a question and answer series addressed to
               the priest Addai.</p>
                    <p>7. A chronicle covering the period from the end of <ref rend="bold">Eusebius of
                  Caesarea</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History to his own time (ca. 692). Unfortunately
               most of this work has perished, but it was used in the 11th cent. by the E. Syr.
               chronographer <ref rend="bold">Eliya of Nisibis</ref>.</p>
                    <p>8. A handbook of philosophical terms, the ‘Encheiridion’.</p>
                    <p>9. The first systematic Syriac grammar. It survives only in fragmentary form, but it
               was an important influence on <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s grammatical work. In
               the examples he gave of grammatical rules, Yaʿqub used Greek vowel letters inserted
               into the consonantal text (similar forms can be found in his Sam ms.), and this
               method was modified by his successors to become the now familiar W.-Syr. system.
               Yaʿqub also wrote a letter to Giwargis bp. of Serugh on orthography.</p>
                    <p>10. Liturgical works: Yaʿqub revised the liturgy of St. James, wrote the ‘Book of
               Treasures’ which included orders and prayers for baptism, consecration of the waters
               on the eve of Epiphany, and marriage. He translated the <hi rend="italic">Sedro</hi>
               of Severus for baptism, and composed a horologium with services for the hours of the
               week, and a calendar of feast days.</p>
                    <p>11. Several prose homilies: on the Eucharistic sacrifice, unleavened bread, against
               Dyophysites, and against transgressors of canon law. Two metrical homilies, on the
               Trinity and Incarnation, and on Faith against the Ch. of E., have been attributed to
               Yaʿqub, but his authorship of the latter is disputed.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>First recorded bp. of <ref rend="bold">Nisibis</ref>. Although Yaʿqub’s name appears in
               a variety of late antique sources, trustworthy historical data about him are quite
               limited. The closest we have to an eye-witness report of Yaʿqub are the ‘Nisibene
               Hymns’ (13–16: CSCO 218–219) of <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>. In the Hymns, which were
               most likely written ca. 359, Yaʿqub is identified as ‘Father’ of the church of
               Nisibis, to which ‘he gave birth and whose infancy he nourished with milk’ (14:21).
               Yaʿqub reared the church, ‘dealing with her as a child, loving her, and teaching her
               piety’ (14:18). Yaʿqub, who was known for his eloquence (14:15) may have been an
               early example for Ephrem in his subsequent role as teacher and poet. Finally,
               Yaʿqub’s burial place in Nisibis ‘protected Nisibis ... during the time of her
               pruning’ (13:19–20). Yaʿqub may well have been recognized as a charismatic figure
               even before his death. It was this early reputation which laid the groundwork for
               Armenian and Greek legends that came to dominate his historical memory: while no
               authentic works were preserved under his name, he would be identified as the author
               of the ‘Demonstrations’ now known to be the work of <ref rend="bold">Aphrahaṭ</ref>, of
               apocryphal Letters addressed to Cath. <ref rend="bold">Papa</ref> of Seleucia, and of
               the spurious ‘Canons of Nicea’. In Armenian tradition he came to be revered as a
               founder of <ref rend="bold">Armenian Christianity</ref> and a relative of Gregory the
               Illuminator. Yaʿqub is also widely seen as one of the bps. who participated in the
               Council of Nicea (325).</p>
                    <p>Historiographical problems relating to the figure of Yaʿqub are complicated by the
               elaboration of what purport to be historical reports from the 4th and 5th cent.
               Alongside the quite generalized remarks of Ephrem, the reports of <ref rend="bold">Theodoret of Cyrrhus</ref>, in the ‘History of the monks of Syria’, and of
               Gennadius, in the ‘Epic Histories’, contributed to the subsequent legend of Yaʿqub as
               a holy man and a model of the episcopacy. This material, which is more of the nature
               of <ref rend="bold">hagiography</ref> than history, is nonetheless important for
               tracing the development of traditions related to the growing cult of Yaʿqub and to
               tensions surrounding the emerging concept of the episcopacy.</p>

                    <p>Poet, known as ‘the Flute of the Holy Spirit and the Harp of the Church’; bp. of
               Baṭnan da-Srug (519–21). Most of the little information about his life comes from two
               notices (ed. Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, vol. 1, 286–9, and Abbeloos, <hi rend="italic">De vita et scriptis Jacobi...</hi> [1867], 311–2); there are also
               two panegyrics (ed. Krüger, <hi rend="italic">OC</hi> 56 [1972]) and a late
               Biography. An outline based on all these sources was compiled by P. Y. Dolabani (<hi rend="italic">Swodo mpaygono…</hi> [Mardin, 1952]).</p>
                    <p>Born in Kurtam, on the Euphrates, his poetic gifts became evident early on. He was a
               student at the <ref rend="bold">School of Edessa</ref>, and this explains the
               appearance in his <hi rend="italic">mimre</hi> of some exegetical traditions that go
               back to <ref rend="bold">Theodore of Mopsuestia</ref>. At an unknown date he was
               appointed Chorepiscopos of Ḥawra, and then at the age of 67 he was consecrated bp. of
               Baṭnan in 519 by Pawlos bp. of Edessa. The date of his death is given as 29 Nov. 521
               in the notice published in <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, and this is the date of his
               liturgical commemoration; other sources, however, give different dates (and even a
               different year, 520; see Vööbus, <hi rend="italic">Handschr. Überlieferung</hi>, vol.
               1, 4). A contemporary source (‘Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Yeshuʿ the Stylite</ref>’,
               54) states that, at the time of the Persian invasion of north Mesopotamia (502/3),
               ‘the respected Yaʿqub, the periodeutes, who composed many <hi rend="italic">mimre</hi> on Scriptural passages, and <hi rend="italic">sugyoto</hi> and <hi rend="italic">zmiroto</hi> ... wrote letters’ of encouragement to different
               cities.</p>
                    <p>Yaʿqub is primarily known for his verse <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> in the
               12-syllable metre (which is named after him); these are said to have numbered 763. At
               least 380 survive, and over half of these have been edited by P. Bedjan. The majority
               of these are highly imaginative expositions of biblical passages; a number of others
               deal with saints (e.g. <ref rend="bold">Shemʿun the Stylite</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, George, etc.). The attribution of some <hi rend="italic">mimre</hi>
               remains uncertain: thus that on the myron is also attributed to <ref rend="bold">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>; definitely not by Yaʿqub, despite the
               attribution, is the <hi rend="italic">mimro</hi> on <ref rend="bold">Alexander</ref>
               (ed. Reinink, CSCO 454–5). A number of <hi rend="italic">madroše</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sugyoto</hi> in mss. are also attributed to him, at least some of
               which are very probably genuinely his.</p>
                    <p>Yaʿqub’s prose writings consist of 1. six <hi rend="italic">turgome</hi>, or prose
               homilies, for Nativity, Epiphany, Lent, Palm Sunday (Hosanna), Good Friday and the
               Resurrection; 2. Lives of holy men of his own lifetime, Daniel of Galash and Hannina
               (unpublished; summaries by F. Nau, in <hi rend="italic">ROC</hi>15 [1910], 60–64);
               and 3. a collection of 43 Letters (not all of which are complete).</p>
                    <p>Various liturgical texts are attributed to Yaʿqub, in particular, three Anaphoras
               (ed. H. G. Codrington, in <hi rend="italic">Anaphorae Syriacae</hi>, II.1 [1951]) and
               the Maronite baptismal rite (ed. A. Mouhanna [OCA 212; 1980]). Though the attibutions
               are uncertain, these texts share many themes to be found in Yaʿqub’s <hi rend="italic">mimre</hi>. Liturgical <hi rend="italic">boʿawoto</hi> are
               attributed to Yaʿqub, as well as to Ephrem and <ref rend="bold">Balai</ref> (depending
               on their meter); some of those attributed to Yaʿqub are just excerpts from his <hi rend="italic">mimre</hi>. Likewise, many <hi rend="italic">bote d-ḥašo</hi> (ed.
               Strothmann [GOFS 32; 1989]) are adapted from Yaʿqub’s <hi rend="italic">mimre</hi>
               (see <hi rend="italic">JSS</hi> 36 [1991], 201–4). Surprisingly, a passage from
               Yaʿqub’s <hi rend="italic">turgomo</hi> for the Resurrection is to be found in the
                  <hi rend="italic">Ḥudrā</hi> (ed. Darmo, vol. 2, 553–4; see <hi rend="italic">OCP</hi> 55 [1989], 339–43).</p>
                    <p>Yaʿqub is commemorated on 29 Nov. in both the Syr. Orth. and the Maron. Calendar.
               Although Assemani and others have claimed that Yaʿqub was Chalcedonian, it is now
               known that he objected to the Council of Chalcedon: this is clear from some of his
               Letters and from a <hi rend="italic">mimro</hi> (probably genuine) lamenting the
               Council. Basically, Yaʿqub disliked the analytic approach to theology current in the
               controversy that followed the Council of 451; his preference was for the theology of
               symbol and paradox that characterised Ephrem’s approach.</p>
                    <p>The appreciation with which Yaʿqub’s <hi rend="italic">mimre</hi> have always been
               held is indicated by the large number of mss. containing them. The oldest of these go
               back to the 6th cent., while several mss. of the 11th to 13th cent. contain huge
               collections, sometimes with well over 200 <hi rend="italic">memre</hi>. There are
               also translations into Armenian, Arabic, Ethiopic (by way of Arabic), and
               Georgian.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Cath. (552–67), successor of Mar <ref rend="bold">Aba I</ref>, in a period of tension
               between the Church and the Persian authorities. Yawsep is primarily known as the
               convener of the Synod of 554, a report of which is preserved in the <ref rend="bold">Synodicon Orientale</ref>. Following an introductory narrative (in which Yawsep
               speaks in the 1st pers. sing., and refers to the internal and external problems faced
               by the Church) and a brief profession of faith (ET in Brock), the report contains 23
               canons aiming at restoring order and discipline in the hierarchy of the church and
               warning against possible abuses by the cath., the bishops, the priests, and the
               laypeople. Even though the report reflects the difficult circumstances of Yawsep’s
               first years, there is no evidence of controversies surrounding the person of the
               Cath. As a matter of fact, the E.-Syr. sources agree that during the first three
               years of his tenure Yawsep ruled with dignity. After three years, however, he is said
               to have become arrogant and to have given himself over to all sorts of misbehavior as
               well as to simony. This eventually led the metropolitans and bps. to depose Yawsep,
               with the consent of Emperor Khusrau, whose favor Yawsep had at first enjoyed. It is
               unclear whether Yawsep’s successor, <ref rend="bold">Ḥazqiel</ref>, was appointed
               immediately after his deposal (567), or only three years later, after Yawsep’s
               death.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, who appears to be well-informed about this episode,
               reports that ‘according to some’ Yawsep, upon his deposal, composed apocryphal
               letters under the names of <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Nisibis</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>, written in support of <ref rend="bold">Papa bar ʿAggai</ref> who, in
               the early 4th cent. had been deposed for reasons of abuse of power. Yawsep would thus
               have retrojected his own experience into that of Papa, claiming with the help of the
               forged letters that he, just like Papa, was innocent. It should be noted, however,
               that Yawsep cannot possibly have been the author of the entire dossier of the Papa
               letters, since some of them already existed, and were read, at the synod of <ref rend="bold">Dadishoʿ</ref> (424).</p>
                    <p>A more positive note is appended to the lengthy discussion on Yawsep in the Chronicle
               of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref> (185–86). The author quotes the historian Bar Sahde
               (ca. 600?) for noticing that when the plague struck, Yawsep devoted himself to
               burying the dead who were lying in the streets, adding Bar Sahde’s comment that this
               was Yawsep’s only meritorious deed. Finally, in a brief fragment, of uncertain
               origin, published by Mingana under the name of <ref rend="bold">Barḥadbshabba</ref> (ET
               in Becker), Yawsep is portrayed as a strong opponent of the <ref rend="bold">School of
                  Nisibis</ref>, ‘which he hated’.</p>

                    <p>Ṣliba d-beth Maʿrūf was born in <ref rend="bold">Telkepe</ref>, where he was ordained a
               deacon at the age of fifteen. In 1689, he moved to Diyarbakır (<ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>), where he became the disciple of Patr. Yawsep I, who ordained him a
               priest and later Metropolitan of Diyarbakır. In 1696, he succeeded Yawsep I as the
               next <ref rend="bold">Chaldean Catholic</ref> Patr. of ‘Babylon of the Chaldeans’ under
               the name of Yawsep  II. In Diyarbakır, he attended one of the local Muslim schools,
               where he studied Arabic, philosophy, and some theology. Besides his activities as Bp.
               and Patr., he copied mss. and wrote a number of theological, liturgical, and poetical
               works in Syriac, <ref rend="bold">Sureth</ref>, and Arabic. He entertained close
               relations with the Latin missionaries, who had made Diyarbakır one of the important
               centers of their missionary activities. This explains the many European influences on
               his theological thinking. On the other hand, he also had a thorough knowledge of the
               Syriac literary tradition, which is, however, less reflected in his theological
               writings. Yawsep II can be considered as one of the Chald. theologians who
               substantially contributed to the partial Latinization of his community in the fields
               of liturgy, spirituality, and dogma.</p>
                    <p>His most important works are: 1. ‘The Joy of the Just and the Medicine of the
               Sinners’ (<hi rend="italic">rwāzā d-kene w-sammā d-ḥaṭṭāye</hi>), originally in
               Arabic, translated by himself into Syriac. This work is based on the ideas of the
               Spanish Jesuit Eusebio Nieremberg y Ottín, who enjoyed great popularity among Latin
               missionaries; 2. The ‘Enlightening Lamp’ (<hi rend="italic">lampedā nuhrānā</hi>),
               also translated from Arabic into Syriac, a compendium of the Roman Catholic
               ‘Ecumenical’ Councils till Ferrara-Florence (1439); 3. A ‘Book of Logic’ (<hi rend="italic">ktābā d-logiqi aw d-mallilutā</hi>), originally in Arabic and
               translated by Yawsep into Syriac; 4. The extremely popular in Chaldean circles ‘Book
               of the Magnet’, a devotional-moral handbook, the Syriac text of which goes back to
               Arabic sources, which were basically translations of Latin devotional works; 5. The
               equally popular ‘Polished Mirror’ (<hi rend="italic">maḥziṭā mriqtā</hi>), in both
               Arabic and Syriac, a dogmatic work against the ‘Jacobites’ and the ‘Nestorians’, as
               appears from the Arabic title. It is essentially a defense of the Catholic dogma and
               the primacy of the Pope, again based on Latin sources.</p>
                    <p>Yawsep also composed a number of liturgical works, a <hi rend="italic">penqitā</hi>
               and a <hi rend="italic">gazzā</hi>, in which he introduced some Latin feasts and
               commemorations (<hi rend="italic">dukrāne</hi>) of saints, as well as an Explanation
               of the ecclesiastical services (<hi rend="italic">puššāq tešmšātā ʿedtānāyātā</hi>).
               In the spiritual field, he wrote a <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> on spiritual exile,
                  <hi rend="italic">aksnāyutā</hi>, added some verses to <ref rend="bold">Bar
                  ʿEbroyo</ref>’s <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> ‘On Perfection’ (his famous <hi rend="italic">memrā zawgānāyā</hi>), and composed a commentary on the latter’s <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> ‘On Divine Wisdom’. Finally, he is the author of a great
               number of poetical compositions of different genres (<ref rend="bold">dorekyātā</ref>,
                  <hi rend="italic">turgāme</hi>, <hi rend="italic">madrāše</hi>), both in Syriac
               and Sureth. As Patr. of a Uniate Church he had an elaborate correspondence with Rome,
               which is partly preserved, e.g. a Roman Catholic profession of faith, sent to the
               Pope (in Arabic).</p>

                    <p>Printer, educator, and scholar. Yawsep came from the village of Marbishu in <ref rend="bold">Hakkari</ref>. He was educated by the English mission in <ref rend="bold">Urmia</ref> and ordained deacon ca. 1894 by the Matran Mar Isḥaq Ḥenanishoʿ. He
               taught in the mission school, copied manuscripts (the earliest of his copies for one
               of the mission clergy, David Jenks, is dated 1891), prepared texts for the press, and
               learned practical <ref rend="bold">printing</ref>. In 1901 he left for the United
               States (where his activities are unrecorded), but had returned to Urmia by 1906 when
               an article on divorce law under his name was published in the first issue of the
               newspaper <hi rend="italic">Kawkba</hi>. In 1909 he was the secretary of the
               ‘Patriarchal Church Committee’ in Urmia. In 1910 he went to England and formed a
               connection with the Trinitaran Bible Society of London, who reprinted the Urmia
               edition of the <ref rend="bold">Peshitta</ref> Old Testament under his nominal
               editorship, and supported his ‘Bible Training School’ in Qurana in Tergawar.</p>
                    <p>Yawsep’s career as a printer had three phases: 1. In Urmia, using the Anglican press,
               he printed the ‘Paradise of Eden’ (1916) and the <hi rend="italic">Nomocanon</hi> of
                  <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ</ref>(1918). 2. In <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, he set up
               the ‘Assyrian Press’, using money collected from the Assyrians in the Baʿqūba refugee
               camp in 1919. This collection enabled him to go to India with his cousin Mar <ref rend="bold">Abimalek Timotheus</ref>and supervise the cutting of Syriac type there.
               A price-list of publications shows 16 finished books published ca. 1921–28, including
               school and religious texts, the most important of the latter being the <ref rend="bold">Qdām w-Bāthar</ref>(1923), <hi rend="italic">Margānitā</hi> (1924), <hi rend="italic">Ṭaksā</hi> (1928), and ‘Paradise of Eden’ (1928). (A <hi rend="italic">Ḥudrā</hi> and large Syriac-English dictionary were never finished.)
               Following Yawsep’s ordination as priest in 1927 by Mar Timotheus (then a figure of
               opposition to the patriarchal family), <ref rend="bold">Eshai Shemʿon</ref> confiscated
               the equipment of the Assyrian Press in 1928. 3. Yawsep re-equipped his press with
               locally available types. In 1934 he named his business the ‘Diqlath Press’ and
               continued to work it until his death in 1952. The publications of this press are not
               well documented.</p>
                    <p>As a schoolmaster and scholar, Yawsep had his greatest influence through his
               ‘Assyrian School’ for boys in Mosul, which he conducted in the same building as the
               press. The next generation of educated Assyrians were largely his old pupils, making
               him the ‘father of modern (As)syrian literature in Iraq’ (Macuch). Yawsep was not a
               critical scholar but a learned and staunch defender of the traditions of the Ch. of
               E. He drew up the Church’s official patriarchal list (printed as an appendix to the
                  <hi rend="italic">Margānitā</hi>) at the behest of Mar Shemʿon in 1924.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Theologian, abbot, and solitary of the Ch. of E., who has been viewed as the
               systematizer of the mystical and ascetic life for the Syriac-speaking churches. The
               primary source for Yawsep’s life is ‘The Book of Chastity’ by <ref rend="bold">Ishoʿdnaḥ</ref>of Baṣra (ca. 868–70). Yawsep was born to Persian Zoroastrian
               parents in the village of Nimrud early in the 8th cent. (ca. 710?). After the village
               rebelled against Caliph ʿUmar b. ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz (r. 717–20), the latter retaliated,
               and soldiers captured the seven-year-old Yawsep, eventually selling him as a slave to
               an Arab, then later to a Christian of Qardu in present-day northern Iraq. Impressed
               by the life of the monks of the nearby monastery of Yoḥannan of Kamul, Yawsep asked
               to be baptized and was allowed to enter at a young age into the monastery of Abba
               Ṣliba in <ref rend="bold">Beth Nuhadra</ref> in northern Iraq. After the obligatory
               novitiate in the cenobitic community, Yawsep established himself as a hermit in Qardu
               for a number of years. Later he was made the head of the monastery of Mar Bassima,
               also in Qardu, but eventually he returned to the eremitic life in the mountain of
               Zinai in <ref rend="bold">Adiabene</ref> of northeast Iraq. In the neighborhood of his
               hermitage was another monastery, that of Rabban Bakhtishoʿ, and before long Yawsep
               was persuaded to become their abbot, remaining until his death. <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref> (d. 1318) said that Yawsep had written an incredible
               number of works, 1900 in total, but only ten were extant by ʿAbdishoʿ’s time. His
               most systematic work, ‘A letter on the three stages of the monastic life’, was not
               positively identified as his work until the last thirty years. In the ms. tradition
               it was attributed to <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref>, but a number of items
               in and about the text had raised questions about its authorship for quite some time.
               A synod called in 786–787 by the Patr. of the Ch. of E. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos
                  I</ref> condemned a trio of writers — <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan Iḥidaya</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Yoḥannan of Dalyatha</ref>, and Yawsep Ḥazzaya — for some of their
               theological ideas. Yawsep was accused of messalianist tendencies, supposedly claiming
               that it is necessary to reject prayer and the office in order to receive the gifts of
               the Spirit. Allied to this is the alleged doctrine that the <hi rend="italic">gmirā</hi> (the perfect or mature person) no longer has any need of active
               prayer, the offices, reading, or manual labor. Neither charge has any substantive
               foundation in the known writings of Yawsep. The synod denied the possibility of
               perfection for human nature, except for that of Christ.</p>

               in the first half of the 6th cent. In this position Yawsep was in charge of teaching
               correct reading and the first level of interpretation. Later sources present him as
                  <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>’s successor as director of the School, but this is
               contradicted by contemporary sources. No further information on Yawsep’s life is
               available, except the fact that he was from Beth Huzaye, as his name indicates, i.e.,
               Huzistan, the ancient region of Susiana.</p>
                    <p>A note in ms. London, Brit. Libr. Add. 12,138, dated to 899 and containing an E.-Syr.
                  <ref rend="bold">Masora</ref>, points to Yawsep as the inventor of the nine
               ‘accents’ or punctuation signs (f. 312v), which are preserved in the later tradition
               with some variation. They mark the division of the sentence and prescribe the tone of
               the pronunciation (particularly in interrogative, imperative, and exclamatory
               clauses) as well as the rhythm of the recitation. Whether Yawsep invented them or
               rather adapted and systematized a pre-existing system remains uncertain. In any case,
               Yawsep’s contribution to establishing the correct reading and pronunciation of
               Classical Syriac in the E.-Syr. tradition must have been significant, even if <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>’s remark that Yawsep ‘changed the Edessene reading
                  (<hi rend="italic">qrāytā</hi>) into the eastern one prevailing among the
               Nestorians’ may be an exaggeration.</p>
                    <p>In addition, Bar ʿEbroyo mentions Yawsep as the author of a work on homographs (i.e.
               words written with the same consonants, but having a different pronunciation and
               meaning), which may have been the first in this genre. Unfortunately it has not been
               preserved. Moreover, Yawsep’s name is connected with the Syriac translation of the
                  <hi rend="italic">Technè Grammatikè</hi>, an influential Greek work on grammar
               written by <ref rend="bold">Dionysius Thrax</ref> (ca. 170 – ca. 90 BC). Whereas the
               E.-Syr. mss. are explicit in ascribing the translation to Yawsep and are supported in
               this by <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>, the work is anonymous in the
               W.-Syr. tradition.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Author, possibly pseudonymous, of an important anonymous historical text bearing the
               title ‘A historical narrative of the period of distress which occurred in <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>, <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>, and all Mesopotamia’. The
               period in question is the years 494–506, during which Edessa suffered famine and
               plague (494–502) and the region experienced a Persian invasion and a Roman-Persian
               war (502–506). The work was almost certainly written, in Edessa, shortly after the
               end of this war. A single sentence before the epilogue alludes to the last years of
               the emperor Anastasius (d. 518), but this is generally thought to be a later scribal
               insertion.</p>
                    <p>The manner of the text’s transmission is responsible for the uncertainty regarding
               the author’s identity. It is not preserved by itself in any ms., but only as a
               section of the much larger <ref rend="bold">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>, also known as
               the Chronicle of (Pseudo-) Dionysios of Tel Maḥre, itself preserved in a single ms.
               (Vat. Syr. 162). One folio in this section of the ms. is from a later scribe, who
               identified himself as Elishaʿ, from the monastery of Zuqnin, and requested God’s
               mercy not only for himself, but also for ‘the priest Mar Yeshuʿ the stylite, from the
               convent of Zuqnin, who wrote <hi rend="italic">ktobo hono d-ʿuhdono hono</hi> of the
               bad times which have passed and of the calamities and troubles which that tyrant
               inflicted among men’. From this scribal note, which has been translated and
               understood in several different ways, Yeshuʿ has been variously interpreted as the
               scribe of the ms., the author of the entire Chronicle of Zuqnin (or both scribe and
               author), or the author (or an early scribe) of the discreet section devoted to the
               period 494–506. If the Yeshuʿ referred to here is in reality the author or scribe of
               the whole Chronicle of Zuqnin, he must have lived sometime after 775 (the date at
               which it ends); in that case ‘the calamities and troubles which that tyrant inflicted
               among men’ cannot refer to the Persian king Kawad who invaded Roman territory in 502,
               but must be related to events in the 8th cent. Irrespective of the resolution of this
               problem, however, references to ‘Yeshuʿ the stylite’ in scholarly literature are
               invariably directed to the narrative of 494–506, although for this reason such
               references are sometimes given as ‘Pseudo-Yeshuʿ’.</p>
                    <p>The narrative of 494–506 is the earliest extant work of Syriac <ref rend="bold">historiography</ref>. Usually designated ‘The Chronicle of (Pseudo-) Yeshuʿ the
               stylite’, it falls into different sections, and to some extent different genres.
               While the first main section is indeed a chronicle, giving a year-by-year account of
               the locust plague, famine and epidemic in Edessa in 494–502, the other main section,
               a narrative of the Roman-Persian war of 502–6, is more akin to the genre of a
               political history, as is the account of Persian-Roman relations preceding the war,
               placed by the author in front of the chronicle of plague in Edessa. There is a highly
               rhetorical prologue and epilogue addressed to a (real or fictitious) abbot named
               Sergios. The work is an astonishingly rich source for the historian of late
               antiquity. Conditions of life in Edessa, including economic conditions, are described
               in great detail, and it is the fullest and most accurate account in any language of
               the war with which it deals.</p>

               became bp. of Zabe between 884 and 891. In the summer of 900 he was consecrated cath.
               He died on 16 May 905. A few canons of a synod that he convened in October 900 are
               quoted in the Nomocanon of <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ bar Brikha</ref>. The rest of the
               canons are preserved in Arabic translation only. In Syriac Yoḥannan authored ‘Canons
               and admonitions (<hi rend="italic">zuhhāre</hi>) of the altar service’; in Arabic a
               treatise on ‘Principles’ (<hi rend="italic">fi al-usūl</hi>) and a Letter on the Fast
               of the Ninevites. In addition, a work on ‘Juridical decisions and rules for division
               of inheritance’ based on Islamic law is attested for him. This may perhaps be
               identical with a collection known in present-day scholarship as ‘Syriac texts on
               Islamic Law’, which is transmitted in both the E.- and W.-Syr. tradition as well as
               in an Arabic translation. While a marginal note in the Arabic translation attributes
               the work to Yoḥannan, the E.-Syr. mss. transmit it anonymously, and W.-Syr. mss.
               attribute it either to a Patr. Yuḥanon (whose identity cannot be ascertained) or to
               ‘Mor Ignatius and Mor Yuḥanon’. Its authorship, therefore, remains uncertain.</p>

                    <p>Author of a summary history of the world. Evidently from Penek in Beth Zabdai, he

               </hi>‘Book of the main events’, a history of the world in 15 Books, ending up with
               his own time. A verse treatise on monastic life by him is also preserved, as well as

               into Arabic, and ‘the Small Compendium’ was particularly influential: it was
               translated three times into Arabic, and twice into Latin. In Arabic only Books 5–7
               survive (in the translation by Mūsā b. Ibrāhīm al-Ḥadīthī, fl. ca. 930), but both
               Latin translations are preserved complete: the first, by Gerard of Cremona (12th
               cent.) was first printed in 1525, and the second, by Andreas Alpagus (who made
               considerable use of the first), was published in Venice in 1550.</p>

                    <p>Teacher of biblical interpretation at the <ref rend="bold">School of Nisibis</ref>.
               Yoḥannan was a relative of <ref rend="bold">Abraham of Beth Rabban</ref> and both he
               and Abraham were probably related to <ref rend="bold">Narsai</ref>, the first director
               of the School of Nisibis and the ‘master’ (<hi rend="italic">rabbān</hi>) who is
               referred to in the second part of both their names. Yoḥannan may have served as an
               assistant or a co-administrator to Abraham during the latter’s tenure as head of the
               School. It is noteworthy, however, that <ref rend="bold">Barḥadbshabba</ref> the
               historian, our main source on Abraham, does not mention Yoḥannan’s name at all, while
               the other Barḥadbshabba, the author of the Cause, emphasizes Yoḥannan’s significance
               in the School.</p>
                    <p>Like Abraham, Yoḥannan is credited with biblical commentaries, none of which have
               survived. He is regularly quoted, however, by later E.-Syr. biblical commentators. In
               one of his letters (no. 9), Patr. <ref rend="bold">Timotheos  I</ref> is probably
               referring to Yoḥannan’s commentary on Leviticus when he tries to dissuade his
               correspondent from understanding Yoḥannan’s interpretation of Lev. 18:18 as allowing
               a Christian to marry his wife’s sister after the death of his wife, a practice which
               Timotheos strongly opposed.</p>
                    <p>Outside the field of biblical interpretation, Yoḥannan is said to have authored
               treatises against the Jews, and against the Eutychians (Barḥadbshabba) or the Magi
               (Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref>), along with discourses, one of which dealt
               with the Persian emperor Khusrau (r. 531–78), either when he gained control over <ref rend="bold">Nagran</ref> (572) or at his death. Since, however, Barḥadbshabba
               situates Yoḥannan’s death during the plague which raged in Northern Mesopotamia in
               the first half of the 560s, we are left with a chronological problem here, reminding
               us of how little is known about this intriguing figure.</p>

                    <p>Commonly known as Yoḥannan Saba (‘Elder’). An E.-Syr. monk, author of a Syriac
               collection of mystical discourses, letters, and maxims (‘chapters of knowledge’).
               Born in Ardamut, a village northeast of <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, in northern Iraq.
               As a youth he regularly visited the monastery of Mar Aphnimaran to read ascetical
               literature and to practice fasts and vigils. Eventually he entered the coenobium of
               Mar Yozadaq in the Qardu mountains (in present-day Turkey). After seven years he
               adopted the eremitic life in the mountains of Beth Dalyatha (‘house of the
               vine-branches’), north of Qardu. In his old age he returned to Qardu, where a group
               of monks made him their abbot, until his death. His ascetic writings circulated
               anonymously (by ‘the spiritual elder’) and were translated into Arabic and Ethiopic.
               Some of his homilies slipped into the Greek collection of <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq of
                  Nineveh</ref> and thence into Latin and other languages of medieval Europe. His
               writings have survived only in W.-Syr. mss., presumably because his works were banned
               by <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref>, Cath. of the Ch. of E., in 786/7. He prescribed
               a spiritual path beginning with repentance and ascetic exercises, progressing through
               purity and serenity, and culminating in perfection. His system was based on
               guidelines in the Sermon on the Mount: ‘Be perfect as your heavenly Father is
               perfect’ (Mt 5:48); ‘Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God’ (Mt 5:8),
               ‘in their heart’, Yoḥannan mystically adds.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Theologian and theoretician of the spiritual life. His identity has been confused
               with at least two other persons named Yoḥannan of Apamea: a contemporary writer
               accused of heresy by <ref rend="bold">Philoxenos of Mabbug</ref> (who also called this
               writer ‘Yoḥannan the Egyptian’); an 8th-cent. writer condemned under <ref rend="bold">Timotheos I</ref> of the Ch. of E. <ref rend="bold">Theodoros bar Koni</ref> and
                  <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> reported heretical ideas attributed to Yoḥannan
               Iḥidaya, but these ideas have yet to be found in extant texts of Yoḥannan Iḥidaya. A
               number of texts are now available, written during the period 430–50. Yoḥannan Iḥidaya
               does not give evidence of allegiance to any side in the Christological controversies
               of that period, though de Halleux and Strothmann believe he had affinities to the
               miaphysite position. Yoḥannan Iḥidaya’s theological system features two tripartite
               structures of the spiritual life. First are the orders (<hi rend="italic">ṭakse</hi>)
               of spiritual development: the way of the body (<hi rend="italic">pagrānutā</hi>), the
               way of the soul (<hi rend="italic">napšānutā</hi>), the way of the spirit (<hi rend="italic">ruḥānutā</hi>) — which bears close resemblance to <ref rend="bold">Evagrius</ref>’s system. Second are the levels (<hi rend="italic">mušḥātā</hi>)
               which a person attains: purity (<hi rend="italic">dakyutā</hi>), serenity (<hi rend="italic">šapyutā</hi>), and perfection (<hi rend="italic">gmirutā</hi>). The
               latter can only be fully attained after the resurrection. Central to Yoḥannan
               Iḥidaya’s theology is the vision of the New World which will come only after the
               resurrection of the dead, but which is prefigured for the individual in the sacrament
               of baptism. Yoḥannan Iḥidaya’s influence on later Syriac writers, both Eastern and
               Western, is significant, particularly in his conceptualization of the tripartite
               ‘orders’ of the spiritual life. Probably due to the confusion and controversy over
               his identity, his works were seldom transmitted under his name. Those now identified
               by modern scholarship are largely letters and dialogues with several essays on
               prayer.</p>
                    <p>Under his name are preserved a Commentary on Qohelet, the authenticity of which is
               disputed (ed. Strothmann), as well as fragments of a Commentary on Job, which most
               likely does not belong to him (ed. Van Rompay).</p>

                    <p>Monk of the Monastery of Mar Michael ‘Companion of the Angels’, <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, Yoḥannan was the author of a long poem of moral exhortation entitled
                  <hi rend="italic">Ktābā d-šappirut dubbāre</hi>, transmitted in a number of both
               E.- and W.-Syr. mss.; three of the <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> are based closely on
               Wisdom books of the Hebrew Bible (those on Qohelet and Bar Sira are ed., with GT, by
               Deppe and by Strothmann). The work was published in Rome in 1868 by Eliya Yoḥannan
               Millos, Chald. metropolitan of ʿAqra, together with various other texts, under the
               title <hi rend="italic">Directorium Spirituale</hi>; on the title page Millos gives
               the date of its composition as 1245 (though on what authority is not clear; on p. 113
               there is a note to say that the <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> on the Mysteries was

                    <p>Born in <ref rend="bold">Mosul</ref>, he became monk and abbot of the <ref rend="bold">Monastery of Rabban Hormizd</ref> near <ref rend="bold">Alqosh</ref>. In 1552, a
               synod of E.-Syr. bishops elected Yoḥannan Patr. of the Ch. of E. in order to protest
               against the not canonical, but in this period institutionalized system of hereditary
               succession, where the dignity of Patr. was mostly passed from uncle to nephew and
               thus remained within the same family. This synod was not recognized by the legitimate
               Patr. Shemʿon VII bar Mama and a part of the E.-Syr. bishops. In order to obtain
               recognition, at the initiative of Latin missionaries, Yoḥannan Sullaqa contacted
               Roman Catholic authorities and traveled to Rome by way of <ref rend="bold">Jerusalem</ref>, where his travel companions sent a letter to Pope Julius III
               requesting him to ordain Yoḥannan Sullaqa as their Catholicos Patr. On the basis of
               the later oral testimony of Yoḥannan Sullaqa in Rome, the Roman authorities
               incorrectly assumed that Patr. Shemʿon VII had died in 1551, which paved the way to
               ordain him a bp. and appoint him as ‘Patr. of Mosul’ (1553). After his ordination
               Yoḥannan Sullaqa took the name of Shemʿon VIII, returned to the Middle East, and,
               recognized by the Ottoman authorities, established himself in <ref rend="bold">Amid
               </ref>(Diyarbakır), where he ordained a Metropolitan and several bishops in order to
               secure his succession as head of the new E.-Syr. Uniate Church. He died in 1555,
               probably assassinated at the instigation of Shemʿon VII (d. 1558), as appears from a
               panegyric on Yoḥannan Sullaqa, composed by his successor <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdishoʿ of
                  Gazarta</ref>.</p>
                    <p>Yoḥannan Sullaqa is the author of three different professions of faith (1553),
               originally composed in Syriac. Two of them (of Catholic inspiration) were translated
               into Latin by <ref rend="bold">Andreas Masius</ref>; the third is found in the
               panegyric of ʿAbdishoʿ and clearly belongs to the Ch. of E.</p>

                    <p>Following the death of Patr. Yuḥanon IX (1057), Yuḥanon was elected by the Oriental
               bps. and consecrated in <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>, while simultaneously a different
               candidate was elected and consecrated with broader support (Athanasios VI Ḥoye).
               Yuḥanon subsequently stepped down and opted for a quiet life of study and
               scholarship, thus allowing Athanasios to take office. When five years later, however,
               Athanasios died, Yuḥanon was urged to come back and was unanimously elected as
               Athanasios’s successor, serving for nine years, until his death in 1072 (or 1073).
               Yuḥanon spent most of his life in Amid, rather than in <ref rend="bold">Melitene</ref>,
               due to the Byzantine oppression of the Syr. Orth. Our main sources for Yuḥanon’s life
               are <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> (XV.1; ed. Chabot, 573–5 and 579 [Syr.];
               vol.  3, 162–4 and 170–2 [FT]) and <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref> (Ecclesiastical
               History, ed. Abbeloos and Lamy, vol. 1, 435–48).</p>
                    <p>According to Michael Rabo, Yuḥanon was a very prolific writer, who ‘filled the
               universe with his letters and volumes’ (XV.3: ed. Chabot, 579 [Syr.]; vol. 3, 171
               [FT]; cf. Bar ʿEbroyo, vol. 1, 447). He specifically mentions his work on <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Isḥaq</ref> (of Antioch): Yuḥanon is
               said to have brought (selections from) their work together in one volume, which he
               wrote in his old age with his own hands, prevented by death, however, from finishing
               it. Yuḥanon’s name is in fact associated with Isḥaq’s <hi rend="italic">memre</hi> in
               ms. Vat. Syr. 119 (cf. S. E. and J. S. Assemani, <hi rend="italic">Bibliothecae
                  Apostolicae Vaticanae … Catalogus</hi>, I.3 [1759], 115–23) and in ms. Berlin 56
               (cf. E. Sachau, <hi rend="italic">Verzeichniss der syrischen Handschriften</hi>,
               188–90). A letter addressed to the Cath. of the Armenians, in which Armenian
               criticism against the Syr. Orth. is refuted and certain views and practices of the
               latter are defended, is transmitted as the first part of a larger compilation dealing
               with the Armenians. It was edited, translated, and studied twice in 1912 by two
               scholars working independently of one another. There is also an Anaphora transmitted
               under Yuḥanon’s name. Michael reports that Yuḥanon wrote 4 books (of poetry) on the
               sack of Melitene (by the Turks in 1058), but these have not been preserved (Chabot
               574; vol. 3, 159).</p>
                    <p>In Arabic a letter to the Coptic Patr. Christodoulos (1047–77), defending the Syr.
               Orth. practice of mixing salt and oil with the Eucharistic bread, survives. In
               addition, P. Sbath reports that a treatise on the unity and trinity of God, against
               the Muslims, exists in one of the mss. of his collection (see Graf).</p>

                    <p>Translator, scribe, minor writer, and bp. He was born Yuḥanon bar Shuqayr in <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref>. His family was originally from Ṣadad and is mentioned in
               ms. sources as early as 1527. He became a monk in <ref rend="bold">Dayr Mār Mūsā
                  al-Ḥabashī</ref> and was later ordained priest there. He became the vicar of <ref rend="bold">Damascus</ref> in 1752 and was consecrated its bp. in 1754 in <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>. He died in June 1783 and was buried in Damascus.</p>
                    <p>His literary works include: 1. A translation of the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> into Arabic in 1759, based on two Syr. mss.; 2. He may have
               authored the biographies of four patriarchs and the lists of the bishops they
               consecrated from 1687–1759; 3. A letter on the Orthodox faith, probably against
               Michael Jarweh; 4. Hymns in colloquial Arabic, some of which are used today.</p>

                    <p>Aaron bar Maʿdani received the name of Yuḥanon when he became Metropolitan of <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> around the year 1230. In 1231/2 he was ordained <ref rend="bold">Maphrian</ref> of the East and appointed Patr. in December 1252. As
               Patr. he was not recognized by all bishops, some of whom had sworn allegiance to bar
               Maʿdani’s rival, Dionysios Angur, ordained a few months earlier. Only after the
               latter’s violent death in 1261 was he accepted as Patr. of the whole Church till his
               death in 1263 in the monastery of Baksimeṭ (Cilicia).</p>
                    <p>Bar Maʿdani is a typical representative of the <ref rend="bold">Syriac
                  Renaissance</ref>. He studied Arabic in <ref rend="bold">Baghdad</ref> and,
               according to <ref rend="bold">Bar ʿEbroyo</ref>, he acquired great proficiency in the
               literary language. He is the author of several Arabic liturgical and moral homilies
               in rhymed prose. There is some uncertainty whether these are (partly) based on an
               earlier Syriac original. His collection of Syriac poems deals with different
               subjects: two poems on the soul, symbolically designated as <hi rend="italic">Poraḥto</hi> ‘Bird’, inspired by the imagery and style of Ibn Sīnā’s ‘Recital On
               the Bird’ and his ‘Ode On the Soul’; on the way of the Perfect; on the invasion of
                  <ref rend="bold">Edessa</ref>; on the ascetic Aaron and several other shorter poems
               on different themes. The authorship of the latter poems deserves closer examination
               on account of a certain similarity in style with Bar ʿEbroyo’s poetry and the fact
               that early compilations contain poems of both Bar Maʿdani and Bar ʿEbroyo. Bar
               Maʿdani also wrote an Anaphora, which was incorporated into later W.-Syr. liturgical
               compilations.</p>

               of the Plerophoria that he presented at a synod in Gubba Barraya, ca. 585, he was
               excommunicated. Nothing is known of his subsequent career. Excerpts of some of his

                    <p>Monk, missionary, church leader, (titular) Bp. of Ephesus, hagiographer, and
               historian. From the region of <ref rend="bold">Amid</ref>, Yuḥanon entered the monastic
               life as a child. Exiled in the 520s during the Miaphysite persecutions under emperors
               Justin I and Justinian, Yuḥanon traveled throughout the eastern Roman provinces and
               Egypt, settling in Constantinople ca. 540 among the displaced Miaphysite community.
               In 542, Emperor Justinian chose Yuḥanon to lead a missionary campaign in Asia Minor
               during which Yuḥanon claims to have converted 80,000 pagans and schismatics, and
               founded 98 churches and 12 monasteries. Consecrated Bp. of Ephesus ca. 558 by <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</ref>, Yuḥanon seems never to have resided in his
               diocese. Yuḥanon served as archimandrite of a monastery and leader of the
               Constantinopolitan Miaphysites until his imprisonment under Justin II in the 570s,
               where he remained until his death. His hagiographical collection ‘Lives of the
               Eastern Saints’, written in the 560s, and his Ecclesiastical History, written in
               three parts and covering up through 588, provide some of our most important

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Monk, stylite, and author. In spite of a reasonable amount of information, several
               crucial questions concerning Yuḥanon remain without an answer, due to the fact that
               so little of his work has survived. It is also unclear whether we are dealing with
               one person or with more persons having similar names.</p>
                    <p>First, Yuḥanon is known for his exchange of letters with <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of
                  Edessa</ref> and with <ref rend="bold">Giwargi bp. of the Arab tribes</ref>.
               Seventeen of the letters by Yaʿqub are addressed to Yuḥanon (Van Ginkel, 78–81),
               while four extant letters of Giwargi have him as the addressee. One letter written by
               Yuḥanon himself survives in ms. Brit. Libr. Add. 12,154, f. 291r (see Wright, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi>, vol. 2, 988b), but remains unedited. It deals with
               the prophecy contained in the biblical verse Gen. 49:10, and is addressed to the
               priest Daniel Ṭuʿoyo (i.e., belonging to the Arab tribe of the Ṭuʿoye); its author is
               named as ‘Yuḥanon Esṭunoyo in the monastery of Litarba (LYTʾRB)’. Yuḥanon clearly
               belonged to the network of Syr. intellectuals who discussed in their letters a wide
               range of topics dealing with history, chronology, philosophy, astronomy, literature,
               and biblical interpretation. Litarba (LYTʾRB or LYTRYB) is commonly identified with
               Athareb near <ref rend="bold">Aleppo</ref> (see Castellana). Yuḥanon was younger than
               Yaʿqub and it is generally assumed that he died in 737/8.</p>
                    <p>Second, Yuḥanon is credited with the authorship of a chronographical work (with a
               particular interest in chronology), which was used and referred to in the later
               tradition, esp. in <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref> and <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>. Apart from these references and a limited number of
               quotations, this work, which probably reached to ca. 726/7, is not preserved.</p>
                    <p>Third, a short grammatical work was preserved in the E.-Syr. ms. Alqosh (olim) 139
               (or 133?; see J. Vosté, <hi rend="italic">Catalogue de la Bibliothèque
                  syro-chaldéenne du Couvent de Notre-Dame des Semences près d’Alqoš</hi>[1929], see
               108, ms. 293), which Moberg studied on the basis of a copy provided by A. Scher. Its
               author is introduced as ‘Yuḥanon Esṭunoyo in the Monastery of Mor Zʿuro near Serugh’.
               Moberg pointed out this work’s dependence on the grammar of Yaʿqub of Edessa (as well
               as on the Syr. translation of <ref rend="bold">Dionysius Thrax</ref>), but was
               reluctant to identify the author with Yuḥanon of Litarba.</p>
                    <p>Fourth, ‘Yuḥanon Esṭunoyo of Beth Mor Zʿuro at Serugh’ (echoing the name of the
               grammarian) is mentioned as the main character in a theological discussion with an
               opponent (who poses as a non-Christian and may be a Muslim), of which a brief report
               is preserved in the Maronite ms. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Syr. 202 (ff. 135v–139r). Whether
               we are dealing here with the correspondent of Yaʿqub of Edessa (as Suermann assumes)
               is uncertain (see Hoyland, 516–17).</p>

               despite their state of decay. After 1124/5, when he was appointed metropolitan of
               Mardin and the surrounding region, he was in a position to carry out restorations
               both there and in local village churches and monasteries (a list is given), and to
               encourage the revival of the monastic life. He is also said to have written (or

                    <p>Saint and first patr. of the Syriac Maron. Church of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>.
               Maronite sources situate the election of Yuḥanon and the formation of the
               patriarchate against the backdrop of the Christological controversies as they related
               to the See of Antioch. Following the death in 609 of Anastasius II, the last
               Chalcedonian patriarch to reside in Antioch, titular Chalcedonian patriarchs of
               Antioch were appointed by Constantinople, a situation which continued until 702.
               Thereafter, the See remained vacant until 742 when Caliph Hishām allowed the election
               of Sṭephanos III to take place. During the period of vacancy filled by Sṭephanos,
               Syriac-speaking Chalcedonians were without a local hierarchy. It was to remedy this
               situation that the monks of the Monastery of St. <ref rend="bold">Maron</ref> elected
               one of their own as Chalcedonian patriarch of Antioch who took the name ‘Yuḥanon of
               Maron’.</p>
                    <p>Maronites refute arguments raised against the historicity of Yuḥanon and the
               legitimacy of the patriarchate. They cite Rome’s rejection of the election of
               Macedonius as patr. of Constantinople in 649 as evidence of the fact that, had
               Yuḥanon’s election been viewed as illegitimate, Rome would have rejected it as well.
               The question of the legitimacy of Yuḥanon’s election, as well as the charge of
               Maronite complicity in the monothelete heresy, were further propagated by William of
               Tyre (d.  1186), who depended exclusively on manipulated passages in the Annals of
               Eutychius of Alexandria (Saʿīd b. Baṭrīq) as his source of information on the
               Maronites. In the years following the Muslim Arab conquest of Syria, the region that
               came to be identified as Dār al-Islām (‘the House of Islam’) was effectively cut off
               from Constantinople and the West. In support of their perpetual orthodoxy, Maronites
               cite the consistent recognition of their patriarchate by Rome and their disavowal of
               monotheletism once they learned of its condemnation at the Council of Constantinople
               in 680. Maronite sources indicate that Yuḥanon and his successors were canonically
               constituted and held the title ‘of Antioch’.</p>
                    <p>Several ecclesiastical works are attributed to Yuḥanon Maron, including an Anaphora,
               or eucharistic prayer, which bears his name, and a treatise (<hi rend="italic">mimro</hi>) on the priesthood. The feast of Yuḥanon Maron is celebrated in the
               Catholic Church on 2 March .</p>

                    <p>Former monk of the Monastery of Eusebona, he became the <hi rend="italic">synkellos</hi> (secretary) of Patr. <ref rend="bold">Athanasios I Gamolo</ref>,
               whom he succeeded in 630/1. As Patr. he is especially known for his conversations
               with a Muslim Emir, probably ʿUmayr b. Saʿd b. ʿUbayd, which took place in 644. The
               Syriac report of this encounter by his secretary is preserved in a single ms. written
               in 874. There are a number of elements in the text, especially a discussion on
               inheritance law, which suggest that the original report was reworked by later
               redactors, possibly in the 8th or even the 9th cent.</p>
                    <p>According to the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Dionysios of Tel Maḥre</ref>, preserved
               in the work of <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref>, Yuḥanon  III (Yuḥanon I, if one
               does not follow the W.-Syr. computation of the patriarchal lists) would have been
               responsible for the supervision of the translation of the Gospel from Syriac into
               Arabic (not preserved). He composed a letter to Marutha on the persecution of the
               Miaphisite Christians in Persia by <ref rend="bold">Barṣawma of Nisibis</ref>
               (preserved in Michael’s Chronicle). His other writings comprise: a <hi rend="italic">pleropuryā</hi> (apologetic treatise) on the aphtartodocetic doctrines of <ref rend="bold">Julian of Halicarnassus</ref>; another on Christology with strong worded
               condemnations of the ‘Nestorians’ and the Chalcedonians; a homily on the consecration
               of the Holy Myron (and, according to the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Siirt</ref>, ch.
               110 [PO 13.4, 634]; the text itself of the consecration of the Myron as well as of
               the Blessing of the Water at Epiphany); a number of <hi rend="italic">sedre</hi>,
               prayers of intercession arranged in a specific order (<hi rend="italic">sedrā</hi>)  — which gave him his name <hi rend="italic">d-sedre</hi> ‘of the

                    <p>Bp. of Tella (d-Mawzlat) 519–21. Born 482 in Kallinikos in the province Osrhoene, he
               received a good education and was fluent in both Syriac and Greek. In 507 he joined
               the monastic community of Mar Zakkay in Kallinikos and was ordained (among others by
                  <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of Serugh</ref>) bp. of Tella in (Nov.–Dec.?) 519. As
               Miaphysite bp. he was exiled in 521/2, and lived in hiding around <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref> and in Persia. In exile he ordained thousands of deacons and
               priests, and thereby established a Miaphysite church hierarchy which became the
               foundation of the Syr. Orth. Church. In 532/3 he attended a discussion of faith with
               Chalcedonian bishops in Constantinople. For building an underground church, he was
               persecuted after 536, caught in the mountains around Shighar in Persia in early Feb.
               537 and brought to <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref> where he died 6 Febr. 538.</p>
                    <p>He is remembered in two Lives, one by <ref rend="bold">Eliya</ref> (CSCO 7–8, 31–95
               [23–60]) and one by <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref> (PO18, 513–26). His own
               works show him as a reform bp. involved in the ecclesiastical and christological
               controversies of his days and include Canons for priests and deacons, questions and
               answers (especially concerning the Eucharist), a commentary on the Trisagion, and a
               profession of faith.</p>

                <div type="body">
                    <p>Greek author and bp. Zacharias was born in Maiuma, the port of Gaza, in the late
               460s; he studied at the School of Gaza and then went on to higher studies in rhetoric
               and philosophy in Alexandria, where he belonged to a group of zealous Christian
               students known as <hi rend="italic">philoponoi</hi> (‘lovers of labour’). He first
               met <ref rend="bold">Severus</ref> in Alexandria and he later followed him to <ref rend="bold">Beirut</ref> to study law. In the early 490s he moved to Constantinople
               to practice law, and met Severus again during the latter’s time in the capital,
               508–11. Details of the later years of his life are very scanty; at some time, perhaps
               shortly before 536, he became bp. of Mytilene. The date of his death is unknown. Of
               his various writings (<hi rend="italic">CPG</hi> 6995–7001), a few are only known in
               Syriac translation; the most important of these are his Ecclesiastical History and
               ‘Life of Severus’. The former covers from the Council of Chalcedon (451) to the end
               of the reign of Zeno (491), which was incorporated into <ref rend="bold">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>’s Ecclesiastical History as Books 3–6, perhaps in a
               slightly adapted form. The original Greek was used by Evagrius Scholasticus in his
               Ecclesiastical History; the Syriac translation is occasionally quoted by <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> in a fuller form than is found in Pseudo-Zacharias.
               The ‘Life of Severus’ was written to refute a scurrilous pamphlet claiming that
               Severus had been involved in pagan practices during his student days; it covers up to
               512, when Severus became Patr. of <ref rend="bold">Antioch</ref>. Also surviving is the
               Syriac translation of Zacharias’s Life of the monk Isaiah, and a fragment of a Life
               of <ref rend="bold">Peter the Iberian</ref> (distinct from the Life attributed to <ref rend="bold">John Rufus</ref>), ed. Brooks, CSCO 7–8 (1907), 1–16, 18. His two main
               surviving works in Greek are a philosophical dialogue entitled ‘Ammonios’ (against
               the Aristotelian notion of the eternity of the world), and 7 ‘Chapters against the
               Manichaeans’ (ed. with ET, S. Lieu, in <hi rend="italic">JAC</hi> 26 [1983],
               152–218). In the past some scholars have tried to distinguish between the rhetor, the
               scholasticus, and the bp., but for their probable identity, see Honigmann.</p>

                    <p>A Syr. Orth. monastery dedicated to Mar Ḥnonyo (Arab. Ḥanānyā) located outside <ref rend="bold">Mardin</ref>, and the seat of the patriarchate from 1293 until after
               World War I. The date of its construction is not known, but it may have been
               originally dedicated to a certain Mar Shlemon and was at some point associated with
                  <ref rend="bold">Mar Awgen</ref>. Tradition states that the chapel was built by
               Ḥanānyā II (793–816), bp. of Mardin and Kfartut, and for this reason it was later
               known by his name. From the 14th cent. it became popularly known by <hi rend="italic">kurkmo</hi> (Arab. <hi rend="italic">Zaʿfarān</hi> ‘saffron’), though the reason
               for this is not known. It was ruined and renovated over ten times, the most prominent
               of which was the renovation by <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Mardin</ref> (1087/8–1165)
               that turned it into a monastery appropriate for the seat of the patriarchate. Patr.
                  <ref rend="bold">Michael Rabo</ref> was the first to be consecrated there in 1166
               and to make it a patriarchal seat, though he did not reside there for most of his
               tenure, and after sometime it reverted to a bishopric seat. In 1293, Patr. Ignatius
               b. Wahib (who shared the title with two other patriarchs, Michael in Sīs and
               Constantine in Malatya) made it his seat, and it remained a patriarchal seat until
               Patr. <ref rend="bold">Eliya III</ref> who was forced to vacate it by the authorities
               in the aftermath of the <ref rend="bold">Sayfo</ref> massacres. Its library (mostly now
               in the Church of the Forty Martyrs in Mardin) housed 350 mss. at the turn of the 20th
               cent. Patr. Peṭros III/IV and <ref rend="bold">ʿAbdullāh  II</ref> brought two printing
               presses in 1881 and 1889 from England, and in 1911 a new set of types were obtained
               by <ref rend="bold">Afram Barsoum</ref> (then a monk at the monastery) who financed the
               operation himself. Its most prominent bp. in the 20th cent. was <ref rend="bold">Dolabani</ref> who organized its library. After Dolabani it remained without a
               bp. (but still a seat of a diocese) until the consecration of bp. Saliba Özmen in
               2003. It is now home to two monks and a few dozen local students and is a formal
               tourist attraction with thousands of Turkish tourists visiting every year.</p>

                    <p>Jacob Zingerle was born on 17 March 1801, to a Roman Catholic merchant family in
               Meran, Southern Tyrol. After completing his high school education, Zingerle studied
               philosophy and theology at the university of Innsbruck. During this period,
               Zingerle’s interest in ancient languages was first stimulated, and he began his
               pursuit of Arabic, Greek, and particularly Syriac. In 1820, while still a university
               student, Zingerle entered the Benedictine monastery Marienberg at Meran, taking the
               name ‘Pius’. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1824. Zingerle initially served as
               assistant priest to a couple of local parishes before being called back to Marienberg
               in 1830, where he became a teacher at the monastery-run high school.</p>
                    <p>Zingerle spent most of the next three decades of his life in Meran. He combined his
               work as instructor and later principal of the school with a busy translation, and
               publication, schedule that yielded, amongst others, six volumes of <ref rend="bold">Ephrem</ref>’s works and several collections of Syriac poetry in translation. In
               1861, Pius IX called Zingerle to Rome, installing him as professor of Arabic at the
               Sapienza. Zingerle also served as <hi rend="italic">scrittore</hi> for the Vatican
               Library, an office that allowed him access to primary sources that would fuel his
               scholarship for the rest of his life.</p>
                    <p>Health concerns and homesickness brought him back to Marienberg in 1864, where he
               remained until his death on 10 Jan. 1881. During this final period of his life,
               Zingerle published, amongst other works, a Syriac chrestomathy and dictionary; he is
               best remembered for his translations of Ephrem’s and <ref rend="bold">Yaʿqub of
                  Serugh</ref>’s sermons.</p>

                    <p>A universal chronicle which begins with the creation of the world and ends with the
               year 775/6, the time of composition. It is known from a single ms., partially
               palimpsest, purchased by <ref rend="bold">J. S. Assemani</ref> from <ref rend="bold">Dayr
                  al-Suryān</ref> in Egypt in 1715 and added to the treasures of the Vatican Library
               under the siglum Codex Zuqninensis Vat. Syr. 162. Separate folios belonging to the
               last part of the chronicle were acquired in 1842 from the same monastery by H.
               Tattam, and are now housed in the British Library (Add. 14,665, ff. 2–7). The
               author’s name is not given; the first folios which may have included it are missing.
               A likely candidate, however, is <ref rend="bold">Yeshuʿ the Stylite</ref> of Zuqnin,
               whose name is commemorated in a 9th cent. colophon inserted in the chronicle by a
               Syriac monk residing in Egypt. The work is conveniently divided into four parts
               reflecting more or less the major literary sources compiled by the author. Part I
               spans from the creation of the world to the reign of Constantine, and in it the
               Chronicle of <ref rend="bold">Eusebius of Caesarea</ref> is a major source. Part II
               goes from the time of Constantine to the time of Theodosius II, on the basis of the
               Ecclesiastical History of Socrates Scholasticus and such other literary sources as
               the so-called Chronicle of Yeshuʿ the Stylite. Part III, based among others on the
               Ecclesiastical History of <ref rend="bold">Yuḥanon of Ephesus</ref>, covers the reigns
               of Zeno, Anastasius, Justin I, and Justinian. Part IV, essentially the personal
               contribution of the chronicler, deals with the reign of Justinian and continues to
               the year 775. The accounts dealing with the period between 767 and 775 are
               particularly detailed and altogether they form a unique source on the economic
               policies of the early Abbasids, namely Caliph Abū Jaʿfar al-Manṣūr, and on the
               history of the Syr. Orth. Church in the Jazīra in those years.</p>
