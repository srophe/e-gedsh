                    <p>Thomas Christians is the term often used for Christians in south-west India

                        India in 52. The early name given to them locally was ‘Nazrani’, which
                        corresponds to <hi rend="italic">nāṣrāye</hi>, which was used by the
                        Sasanian authorities for Christians (subsequently taken over in Arabic).

                        successive divisions have taken place, with the result that today in Kerala
                        there are seven different Churches of Syriac tradition: those of the

                        was well developed by the 1st <abbr>cent.</abbr> AD, and there is nothing impossible in
                        the strong local oral and written traditions that St. Thomas came to south

                        Much confusion has been caused, especially in Greek and Latin sources, by
                        the ambiguity of the term ‘India’, which often clearly refers to Ethiopia or
                        South Arabia.</p>

                    <p>References to two early migrations from the Middle East to Kerala are first
                        recorded by 16th-cent. western writers, based on local oral accounts. The
                        first migration is linked to Knai Thoman, represented in western sources as
                        Thomas of Cana, the Canaanite (thus also in one Syriac text, Mingana 1926,
                        481, 513), who is said to have come with a group of Christians including a
                        <abbr>bp.</abbr> Yawsep (sometimes, of Edessa) in 345. Numerous inconclusive attempts to
                        explain the name Knai have been made. The tradition is especially important
                        for the endogamous Knanaya (or ‘Southists’) who trace back their origins to
                        this Thomas. A later group said to have come from the Middle East was led by
                        two bishops, Mar Shabur and Mar Prot (Phrahat, or Peroz?), together with
                        ‘the resplendent’ Sabrishoʿ; an exact date, 823, is even given in one Syriac
                        source (<abbr>ed.</abbr> Land, <hi rend="italic">Anecdota Syriaca</hi>, vol. 1, 27, tr.
                        125). This Sabrishoʿ is often identified with ‘Marovan Sapir Iso’, the
                        builder of the Tharisa church in Quilon which was granted certain privileges
                        in a set of copper plates in Old Tamil, dated 849.</p>
                    <p>The only pre-Portuguese Syriac document from India is a Lectionary of the
                        Pauline Epistles, copied in Shengala (Cranganore) in June 1301, in the time

                    <p>A very important Syriac source from shortly after the arrival of the first
                        Portuguese is a letter of 1504, with a historical introduction (<abbr>ed.</abbr>
                        Assemani, <hi rend="italic">BibOr</hi>, III.ii, 589–99; tr. in Mingana 1926,
                        468–73). This tells how in 1490 two Indians travelled to Gazarta (modern
                        Cizre) to ask the <abbr>

                        </abbr> for bishops; two bishops were consecrated and sent
                        to India, and then in 1501 the next Catholicos sent three further ones, who
                        in 1504 dispatched back the letter in question, describing the situation of
                        the Thomas Christians (‘some 30,000 households’). One of the two Indians in
                        1490 was ‘Joseph the Indian’ who later provided the account of Malabar that
                        formed Book VI of Fracanzano da Montalboddo’s immensely popular <hi rend="italic">Paesi novamente retrovati</hi> (1507). And one of the
                        bishops consecrated in 1501 was Mar Yaʿqub who was to play a prominent and
                        difficult role in dealing with the Portuguese; he died some time before
                        1554. A slightly later Syr. <abbr>bp.</abbr> was Mar Yawsep, consecrated for Malabar by
                        the <abbr>Chald.</abbr>

                        </abbr> in 1558 (five years after the separate <abbr>Chald.</abbr> Catholic line
                        had come into being). Western missionaries in Bassein, however, were
                        successful in preventing him from reaching his destined flock. While in
                        Bassein, and even during his long sea voyages, he diligently copied Syriac
                        <abbr>mss.</abbr>, several of which survive (van der Ploeg 1983).</p>
                    <p>Although the Thomas Christians had at first welcomed the arrival of fellow
                        Christians from Europe, by the end of the 16th <abbr>cent.</abbr> the situation had
                        changed. The last Indian <abbr>bp.</abbr>, Mar Abraham, died in 1597, and in 1599 the
                        metropolitan see of Angamali was demoted to a bishopric under the archbishop
                        of Goa. The next year the Malabar Church was put under the Portuguese Royal
                        Patronage (Padroado). The destruction of all Syriac books considered
                        heretical at the Synod of Diamper (1599) and the Romanization of the rite
                        (though Syriac was still allowed) witness to the domineering character of
                        the European hierarchy in India. Any attempts to contact bishops — even
                        <abbr>Chald.</abbr> Catholic ones — in the Middle East were foiled. In the end, (false)
                        rumors of the drowning of a <abbr>bp.</abbr> from the Middle East, Mar Atallah, led to
                        open revolt in 1653, with the ‘Oath of the Coonan Cross’ (Mattancherry),
                        when the Archdeacon Thomas was ‘ordained’ as <abbr>bp.</abbr> by 12 priests, claiming to
                        have a letter from Mar Atallah legitimizing this. This effectively split the
                        Thomas Christians into two nearly equal halves, those who remained under the
                        control of Rome, and those who were in due course to come under the
                        jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Antioch.</p>
                    <p>Contact in due course was made by the adherents of Thomas with a <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>
                        <abbr>bp.</abbr>, Mar Gregorios, in 1665, and links with the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> Church were
                        further strengthened in 1685, when Maphrian Baselios Yaldo and Mar Ivanios
                        were sent to India by <abbr>Patr.</abbr> ʿAbdulmasīḥ I; although Mar Baselios died
                        shortly afterwards, he left a great impression (thus at Kothamangalam a long
                        inscription in his honor was put up in 1874). In this way the W.-Syr.
                        liturgical tradition (and script) was gradually introduced into Malabar, and
                        seems to have been fully effected by the end of the first quarter of the
                        19th <abbr>cent.</abbr> (van der Ploeg 1983, 39). Prior to this, in 1772, a quarrel had
                        led to schism and the establishment of the separate small Malabar
                        Independent Syrian Church, based in Thozhiyur.</p>
                    <p>Further divisions came in the 19th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, when a reform movement among the
                        <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>, led by Abraham malpan and supported by Anglican missionaries,
                        led to the emergence of the Mar Thoma Church, which formally came into being
                        in 1888. The second half of the 19th <abbr>cent.</abbr> also witnessed the renewal, after

                        communion with Rome, thus marking the beginnings of the Malankara Catholic
                        Church. In the E.-Syr. tradition one further division took place in 1968,
                        just within the Chaldean Syrian Church, when loyalties became divided

                        most of the Churches of Syriac tradition; today, however, it has almost

                        held out longest. A large number of Syriac <abbr>mss.</abbr> have been copied in Kerala
                        (van der Ploeg). Less frequent has been the use of Syriac for <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Inscriptions">inscriptions</ref>, the earliest being dated 1575
