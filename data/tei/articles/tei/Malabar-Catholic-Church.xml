                        liturgical tradition represents the continuity of the Catholic ecclesial
                        tradition in South India that came into being in the 16th <abbr>cent.</abbr> (see <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Thomas-Christians">Thomas Christians</ref>). Under Portuguese and other European
                        missionary influence in the late 16th and early 17th <abbr>cent.</abbr> the local Church
                        became heavily Romanized, especially after the <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Diamper-Synod-of">Synod of
                            Diamper</ref> (1599); Syriac, however, was retained as the liturgical
                        language by Archbishop Francisco Roz, SJ, even though the rite was adapted
                        to Roman norms. Following the revolt against the Padroado and the Jesuits in
                        1653, the Propaganda Fide sent the Carmelite Sebastiani to Malabar (1659) as
                        an Apostolic <choice>
                            <sic>Commissiary</sic>
                            <corr>Commissary</corr>
                        </choice>, and as a result the Catholic party came under the
                        double jurisdiction of the Padroado and the Propaganda Fide, though the
                        influence of the former waned after the Dutch took Cochin in 1663. This
                        event, however, led to the expulsion of Sebastiani, though not before he had
                        consecrated an Indian <abbr>bp.</abbr>, Alexander (1663–87)<choice>
                            <sic/>
                            <corr>,</corr>
                        </choice> to take his place. Sebastiani
                        left an interesting account of his time in Malabar (see Pallath 2006).
                        Another informative account, covering 1773–86, is by a Malabar priest (see
                        Paremmakkal 1971), who went to Lisbon in 1783 for the consecration of
                        another Indian <abbr>bp.</abbr>, Mar Karyatil, who, however, died in Goa (1786) on his
                        way back to Malabar. With the exception of Alexander and Karyatil, all other
                        bishops were Europeans, and it was only in 1896 that three native Indian
                        bishops were again appointed, thus marking the beginnings of an indigenous
                        hierarchy, which was only able to develop again in the 20th <abbr>cent.</abbr>
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1923 Ernakulam was made a metropolitan see, with seven suffragan
                        eparchies, and in 1958 Changanacherry became a second metropolitan see.
                        Since 1962 a number of eparchies outside Kerala have been created (including
                        one for USA, in 2001). On 16 Dec. 1992 Ernakulam-Angamali was raised to the
                        status of a Major Archbishopric, and in 1995 two further metropolitan sees
                        were created (Tellichery and Trichur). There is a separate archbishopric in
                        Kottayam for the Knanaya, or Southists (this goes back to the creation of an
                        Apostolic Vicariate for them in 1911). There are sizable diasporas in North
                        America, Europe, and the Gulf States. The total number of faithful is said
                        to be between three and four million.</p>
                    <p>There are a large number of religious communities for both men and women, the
                        most well known of them being the Carmelites of Mary the Immaculate (CMI),
                        founded in 1831 by the Blessed Kuriakos Elias Chavara (who, among other
                        things, set up a Syriac <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Printing">printing</ref> press in Mannanam in
                        1844).</p>
                    <p>Although very little Syriac literature has ever been produced in S. India,
                        numerous literary and, above all, liturgical <abbr>mss.</abbr> were copied there, and in
                        the 19th and earlier part of the 20th <abbr>cent.</abbr> a number of Syriac printing
                        presses were operative (St. Joseph’s Press at Mannanam was especially
                        productive). Syriac was regularly taught at seminaries, and still is at
                        some, though the shift to Malayam as the liturgical language after the
                        Second Vatican Council has led to a great decline in widespread knowledge of
                        the language. Among works of Syriac scholarship produced in Malabar, two
                        should be singled out: T. Arayathinal’s <hi rend="italic">Aramaic (Syriac)
                            Grammar</hi> (1957; <abbr>repr.</abbr> 2007), and E. Thelly’s <hi rend="italic">Syriac-English-Malayalam Lexicon</hi> (1999), based on Audo’s <hi rend="italic">Simta</hi>.</p>
                    <p>Although the reforms of Vatican II have led to the decline of knowledge of
                        Syriac, at the same time they have encouraged the recovery of the indigenous
                        E.-Syr. liturgical tradition. In practice, however, liturgical renewal has
                        led to much controversy over the direction it should take: a return to the
                        Syriac sources, inculturation (including the adoption of some Hindu
                        customs), or retaining a more western perspective. A vocal advocate for the
                        indigenous tradition of the Thomas Christians and author of many books on
                        the subject was Fr. Placid Podipara<choice>
