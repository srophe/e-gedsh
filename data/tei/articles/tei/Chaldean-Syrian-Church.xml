                        Malabar headed by Antony Thondanatta, and as a result of his desire to
                        extend his jurisdiction to India, consecrated Thoma Rokos as metropolitan
                        based in Trichur (1861). This, however, went against the wishes of Rome, and
                        Rokos was obliged to return to the Middle East in 1862. Since Audo had been
                        forbidden by Rome to consecrate anyone else for Malabar, the result was that
                        Thondanatta was consecrated later that year as Mar ʿAbdishoʿ by Mar Shemʿon

                        his own Metropolitan of Malabar, thus strengthening the schism between the
                        Old and New Calendarists in India. Following the assassination of Mar
                        Shemʿon in 1975 and the election of Mar Denḥa IV as his successor in 1976,
                        Mar Aprem (at that time under Mar Addai II) was active in trying to bring

                        print Syriac liturgical texts. However, it was not until the time of Mar
                        Darmo that many Syriac texts were published; amongst these was the <hi rend="italic">Ḥudrā</hi> (3 vols.; 1960–62), as well as a few literary
                        texts (including some in Modern Syriac). At the time of the disputes between

                        Since Mar Darmo’s death, apart from the printing (in 1982) of Timotheos I’s
                        Letters (1–38), left ready by Darmo, hardly any further Syriac texts were
