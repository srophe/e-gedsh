                    <p>The Syriac medical tradition, as Syriac literature in general, owes a great
                        debt to the Greek heritage, and notably to the Galenism of Late Antique
                        Alexandria (see Temkin). Two periods of Graeco-Syriac translation mark this
                        transfer of knowledge. The first occurred during the early 6th, and the
                        second during the 9th <abbr>cent.</abbr>

                        philosophy in Alexandria. He translated many philosophical texts, but also

                        has to be emphasised that Ḥunayn’s school produced many more and often much
                        better translations than the 6th-cent. translators (see Gutas). Despite
                        their popularity, few of these Syriac versions survived; the Arabic versions
                        by Ḥunayn’s school quickly eclipsed them. We are, however, able to study the
                        Graeco-Syriac translation technique, not least since <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Bar-Bahlul-Hasan">

                        and his entourage (see Bhayro).</p>
                    <p>Syriac authors did not limit themselves to translating Greek sources, but
                        also wrote many independent treatises on various aspects of medicine. But
                        here again, most of the literature is lost today. There are, however, at
                        least two works which ought to be mentioned here. The most substantial
                        extant medical text in Syriac is the so-called ‘Syrian Book of Medicine’ by
                        an unknown author and of unknown date (estimates range from the 6th to the
                        13th <abbr>cent.</abbr>). It consists of three distinct parts: Part One is mainly based
                        on Galen’s ‘On the Affected Parts’ and ‘On the Composition of Drugs
                        according to Places in the Body’; Part Two deals with astro-medicine, that
                        is the impact of the stars on human health; and Part Three contains many
                        popular and magic recipes and treatments. <ref rend="bold"

                        Arabic, Latin, and Hebrew translations (Pormann). It provides an outline of
                        Galenic medicine, the first four books dealing with diseases ‘from tip to
                        toe’; the fifth with bites by insects and poisonous animals, skin condition,

                        Sarapion continues the Greek encyclopaedic tradition as represented by Paul

                        <abbr> ca.</abbr> 640s), but also incorporates the pharmacopoeia of the
                        East (notably Indian) into the system of humoral pathology inherited from
                        the Greeks.</p>
                    <p>We know of many famous Syriac-speaking physicians. Ḥunayn <abbr>b.</abbr> Isḥāq was not
                        only a translator, but also the personal physician of a number of caliphs.
                        Likewise, his teacher Yūḥannā <abbr>b.</abbr> Māsawayh (d. 857) also excelled in the
                        medical art. Both mostly wrote in Arabic, and acquired great fame in the
                        area of ophthalmology. The most prominent Syriac medical family are without
                        any doubt the Bukhtishūʿ. They hailed from the famous city of Gondeshapur
                            (<ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Beth-Lapat">

                        the 10th <abbr>cent.</abbr>
                    </p>
                    <p>This leads us to the final topic: hospitals set up by Syriac Christians. Some
                        scholars have argued that by the 4th <abbr>cent.</abbr> sophisticated hospitals existed
                        in the Christian world (<choice>

                        </choice>in Cappadocia or Gondeshapur); but these claims
                        have rightly been dismissed (see Dols; Horden). It is, however, beyond doubt
                        that Christian charitable ideas had an impact on the development of Islamic
                        Hospitals (Pormann). From a letter to the <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr>

                        </ref> (d.
                        823) we know that a substantial Syriac hospital was in existence by the late
                        8th <abbr>cent.</abbr>; it was called <hi rend="italic">xenodocheion</hi> (Greek for
                        ‘place for strangers’) and <hi rend="italic">bimāristān</hi> (Persian for
                        ‘place of the sick’). Moreover, a number of important Abbasid officials who
                        set up Islamic hospitals  — such as ʿAlī <abbr>b.</abbr> ʿĪsā, the ‘good vizier’ (d. 946)
                        — had Syriac family backgrounds or ties to the Syriac medical elite.</p>
