                        met the Prophet Muḥammad and inspired him to begin preaching to the
                        Arabs.<note/>

                    <p>Sargis Bḥira is the name of a Syriac monk who allegedly met the Prophet
                        Muḥammad and inspired him to begin preaching to the Arabs. The earliest
                        reference to this legendary figure is to be found in the E.-Syr.
                        ‘Disputation of the Monk of Bet Ḥale with an Arab notable’, which is
                        commonly dated to the early 8th  cent. In this religious dialogue the
                        monk-protagonist asserts that the Qurʾānic teaching regarding the Word of
                        God and his Spirit (cf. Qurʾān 4:171) is to be traced back to Sargis’s
                        instruction of the Prophet. In the early 9th  cent., when the polemics
                        between Muslims and Syriac-speaking Christians burgeoned, the rumors about
                        this Christian tutor of the Prophet were spun out into the Syriac ‘Legend of
                        Sargis’. This story relates how a monk received an apocalyptic vision on
                        Mount Sinai about the imminent rise of Arab rule. In this vision, a sequence
                        of theriomorphic appearances, interpreted by an angel, makes clear that the
                        Umayyads fulfilled the prophecy of Gen 17:20 regarding the twelve princes of
                        Ishmael, while the rule of the Abbasids is projected to end with Caliph
                        al-Maʾmūn (<abbr>r.</abbr> 813–833). It is described how, after having received this
                        apocalyptic vision, the monk begins to preach the veneration of one single
                        cross, which leads to his persecution by local ecclesiastical authorities.
                        Fleeing to the desert of Arabia, he meets Muḥammad and informs him that he
                        is destined to become the leader of the Arabs. The monk also tells Muḥammad
                        about his religion and instructs him in a simplified form of Christianity.
                        He urges Muḥammad to convert the Arabs to the one true God and designs a
                        number of religious rituals and precepts for them, which the monk eventually
                        codifies in the Qurʾān. The legend ends with another prophecy about the
                        political and social turmoil under the Abbasids, their final collapse, and
                        the exclusive redemption of Christians at the end of time. This highly
                        polemical tale, which claims that the Qurʾān was written by human hands, has
                        strong apologetic overtones, inasmuch as it suggests that the historical
                        Muḥammad was essentially supportive of Christianity and that he summoned
                        Muslim leaders never to do harm to the Christian communities.</p>
                    <p>The legend survives in two Syriac redactions (E.-Syr. and W.-Syr.). Arguments
                        have been presented by modern scholars as to which Syriac community composed
                        the first version, none of which can be regarded as decisive. There are also
                        two Arabic versions, which go into more detail about the supposed Qurʾānic
                        echoes of Christian teachings.</p>
                    <p>In numerous Muslim biographies of the Prophet, including the early 9th-cent.
                        redactions of <hi rend="italic">al-Sīra al-Nabawiyya</hi> by Ibn Isḥāq,
                        there are references to a monk who recognized Muḥammad, prior to his first
                        revelation, as the awaited new Prophet. In these stories the monk is called
                        only Baḥira, in contradistinction to the ‘Sargis Bḥira’ of the Syriac
                        accounts. Several modern scholars have tried to find a link between the
                        legendary stories about Muḥammad’s alleged teacher and historical figures
                        called Sergios found in Syriac sources. Taking into consideration, however,
                        that the Syriac legend is most probably a polemical adaptation of the
                        Islamic stories, <choice>
                            <sic>i.e. </sic>
                            <corr>i.e., </corr>
                        </choice>presupposing the primacy of the latter, it is likely
                        that Syriac speakers provided this monk with a supplementary name. They may
                        have added the name Sergios, because Baḥira was not commonly known as a
                        proper name in Syriac. It is an epithet for someone ‘tested and approved’ by
                        God, (<choice>
                            <sic>i.e. </sic>

                        </choice>‘venerable’, or ‘eminent’).</p>
                    <p>The idea that Muḥammad was taught by a monk lives on among Eastern
                        Christians. It has been perpetuated in a vast array of accounts with
                        remarkably diverse interpretations of the monk’s supposed intentions and his
                        role in the genesis of Islam.</p>
