                    <p>Ancient city near the Euphrates to the southeast of present-day al-Najaf.
                        Ḥirta was the capital of the pre-Islamic Arab kingdom of the Lakhmids, who
                        were usually allied with the Sasanians and constantly at war with the
                        Ghassānids, allies of Byzantium, to the west. It was an important center of
                        pre-Islamic Arab culture, where many of its poets gathered and where the
                        Arabic script is said to have originated. The name ‘Ḥirtā’ is indicative of
                        its origin as a nomadic encampment, and in Syriac sources it is sometimes
                        called ‘Ḥirtā d-Nuʿmān’ to distinguish it from other such settlements. ʿAmr
                        <abbr>b.</abbr> ʿAdī (<abbr>ca.</abbr> 270–300) is said to have been the first Lakhmid to make Ḥirta
                        his capital. By the 5th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, the population under Lakhmid rule had a large
                        Christian component, called the ʿIbād, which is understood to mean
                        ‘servants’ or ‘devotees’ of the Lord. The Syriac Life of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Shemun-the-Stylite">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/744">Shemʿun the
                            Stylite</persName>
                        </ref> tells us that Nuʿmān I (405–18) revoked the prohibition on
                        his subjects travelling into Roman territory on pilgrimage to Shemʿun’s
                        pillar after a visit from the stylite in a dream. Nuʿmān II (500–3), though
                        not a baptised Christian, is said to have regularly attended church
                        services. Mundhir III (506–54), who had a Christian mother (Māʾ al-Samāʾ)
                        and a Christian wife (Hind, daughter of Arethas/Ḥārith <abbr>b.</abbr> ʿAmr al-Kindī),
                        may have become Christian himself for a brief period before reverting to
                        paganism. The only Lakhmid king to become openly Christian and persist in
                        his faith was Nuʿmān III (583 – ca. 602), the last of the dynasty, who was
                        deposed and killed by the Sasanian king Khusrau II (590–628). Ḥirta was
                        taken by the Muslim army under Khālid <abbr>b.</abbr> al-Walīd in 633. Ḥirta began to
                        decline when the new garrison town of al-Kūfa was founded near ʿĀqolā a few
                        kilometers north of Ḥirta by Saʿd <abbr>b.</abbr> Abī Waqqāṣ in 638, to become the
                        administrative center of al-ʿIrāq under Arab occupation and, for a time
                        under the first Abbasids (750–63), the seat of the caliphate.</p>
                    <p>The first known <abbr>bp.</abbr> of Ḥirta is Hoshaʿ, who attended the synod of the Ch. of
                        E. in 410. The <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr> Catholicoi frequently resided in Ḥirta, especially
                        at times of persecution in areas under direct Sasanian rule, and at least
                        five of them found their resting places in Ḥirta (<ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Dadisho-I">

                    <p>The Lakhmid kings normally resided in palaces outside of Ḥirta, such as the
                        famous palace of al-Khawarnaq to the east of Ḥirta. The township of Ḥirta
                        itself was made up of a series of fortified dwellings, each of them normally
                        associated with a certain clan. Some, at least, of the churches were also
                        associated with specific clans, such as those of the Banū Māzin and Banū
                        ʿAdī. Two churches, unfortunately without indication of their names, were
                        discovered in excavations carried out at Ḥirta by an Oxford expedition led
                        by D. Talbot Rice in 1931. The large number of monasteries that dotted the
                        countryside around Ḥirta were described in the <hi rend="italic">Kutub
                            al-diyārāt</hi>, a special genre of Arabic literature dealing with
                        monasteries, such as Shābushtī’s (d. <abbr>ca.</abbr> 988) ‘Book of monasteries’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-diyārāt</hi>) and Hishām <abbr>b.</abbr> Muḥammad al-Kalbī’s
                        (d. <abbr>ca.</abbr> 819) ‘Book of Ḥīra’ (<hi rend="italic">Kitāb al-Ḥīra</hi>), which is
                        now lost but was used, among others, by the geographer Yāqūt in his <hi rend="italic">Muʿjam al-buldān</hi>. In these works, many of the
                        monasteries around Ḥirta are associated with and named after (often female)
                        members of the Lakhmid royal family, including al-Lajj, a daughter of Nuʿmān
                        II, ʿAlqama, the father of Abū Yaʿfur (503–5), Ḥanẓala, a nephew of the
                        same, Hind the Elder, the wife of Mundhir III, and Hind the Younger, a
                        daughter of Nuʿmān III.</p>
