                    <p>Ever since the 2nd <abbr>cent.</abbr>, when the first Syriac Bible translations were
                        produced, the Bible has played an important role in Syriac Christianity. It
                        is not just that many terms specific to the spirituality of the Syriac
                        Churches have their origin in these versions, they have also contributed to
                        the spread of the dialect of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Edessa">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</placeName>
                        </ref> as a standard
                        language for a large group of Christians. For today’s Syriac churches, they
                        remain important, either in the original tongue or in translations into
                        English or Malayalam. They have, however, also attracted the interest of
                        scholars outside the Syriac communities. This has to do with the fact that
                        the Syriac versions are very ancient and have also come down to us in
                        relatively ancient <abbr>mss.</abbr> (see <ref rend="bold"
                       target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Bible-Old-Testament-manuscripts">Bible, <abbr>OT</abbr> manuscripts</ref> and <ref rend="bold"
                       target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Bible-New-Testament-manuscripts">Bible, <abbr>NT</abbr>
                            manuscripts</ref>). They give us a picture of the original Hebrew and
                        Greek texts at the moment the translations into Syriac were made.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Syriac Translations of the Old Testament</label>
                    <p>The first Syriac version of the <abbr>OT</abbr> must have been made in the second half of
                        the 2nd <abbr>cent.</abbr> At least since the 9th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, it has been known under the name
                            <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Peshitta">Peshitta</ref>. In contrast to other early Christian translations of
                        the <abbr>OT</abbr>, it was based on the Hebrew Bible rather than the Greek Septuagint.
                        This fact gives it a special place among the witnesses to the Hebrew Bible,
                        the pronunciation of which was codified only from the 7th <abbr>cent.</abbr> onwards.</p>
                    <p>When Greek <abbr>OT</abbr> commentaries started to be translated into Syriac in the 4th
                        and 5th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, their translators used the Peshitta for the biblical
                        quotations. Soon they found out that this text did not always agree with the
                        Greek text of the commentaries, which sometimes made it hard to understand
                        what the exegete in question was referring to. For this reason, E.-Syr.
                        translators started to add <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> translations of the
                        biblical text as quoted in the Greek commentary to the verse taken from the
                        Peshitta. They would mark these <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> renderings
                        specifically as ‘the Greek’. At least since <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Mushe-of-Aggel">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/64">Mushe of
                            Aggel</persName>
                        </ref> early in the 6th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, W.-Syr. translators started simply
                        to render the biblical text of the commentary, no longer referring to the
                        Peshitta. Such <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> renderings have often been
                        mistaken for quotations from a version made by the chorepiscopus <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Polykarpos">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/35">Polykarpos</persName>
                        </ref> in 507/508, which may have extended to the <abbr>OT</abbr>: there
                        is evidence at least for Genesis, Exodus, and Isaiah (the so-called
                        Syro-Lucianic fragments edited by Ceriani may belong to it). This version is
                        indicative of the high status accorded to the Greek language and Greek Bible
                        by the person who commissioned it, <ref rend="bold"
                       target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Philoxenos-of-Mabbug">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/44">Philoxenos
                            of Mabbug</persName>
                        </ref>. Philoxenos was afraid that loose renderings might give
                        rise to Dyophysite interpretations.</p>
                    <p>A century later, in 613–17, the status of Greek among the <abbr>W. Syr.</abbr> was such
                        that <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Pawlos-of-Tella">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/82">Pawlos of Tella</persName>
                        </ref> felt the need to make an extremely literal
                        ‘mirror translation’ of the Septuagint, known as the <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Syro-Hexapla">Syro-Hexapla</ref>.
                        Here the unit of translation is the single word or even part of it. The name
                        refers to Origen’s Hexapla, as it claims to be based on a version of the
                        fifth, Septuagint, column supplied with text-critical signs indicating where
                        material has been added or omitted, as well as notes referring to the three
                        revisions: Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion.</p>
                    <p>At a time when the Greek language was losing its status, <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yaqub-of-Edessa">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/113">Yaʿqub of
                            Edessa</persName>
                        </ref> produced his revision of the Peshitta with the help of one
                        or more Greek <abbr>mss.</abbr>; there is no evidence that he used the Syro-Hexapla, as
                        has been assumed by some. It may be seen as a last effort to make the Greek
                        Bible acceptable to Syriac readers. Yaʿqub’s version was a compromise
                        between the two positions defended in Syriac Christianity: the position of
                        Philoxenos, who would have liked to replace the Peshitta with a very literal
                        rendering of the Septuagint, and that of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Eusebius-of-Emesa">

                            Emesa</persName>
                        </ref>, who thought that the Peshitta was reliable because the
                        Syriac language was related to the Hebrew. In addition, Yaʿqub wanted to
                        clarify the text to his readers.</p>
                    <p>Syriac exegetes of the <abbr>OT</abbr> (see <ref rend="bold"

                        49:10 and 49:23). These alternative readings happen to agree with Targum
                        Onqelos. In the 5th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, translations of Antiochene commentaries of such

                    <p>The Syriac versions of the <abbr>NT</abbr> are all based on Greek texts. Though they are
                        the oldest translations in a Semitic language, there is no reason to assume
                        any direct connection between these Syriac (<choice>
                            <sic>i.e. </sic>

                        </choice>Eastern Aramaic) texts and
                        Jesus’ original words in Western Aramaic. Some unusual forms of vocabulary
                        and grammar found in the so-called Old Syriac translation can easily be
                        explained as archaic forms of the Syriac language. They should not
                        necessarily be seen as Western, Palestinian Aramaic forms. For biblical
                        scholars, the importance of the Syriac versions lies primarily in the fact
                        that they are essential witnesses to the text history of the Greek <abbr>NT</abbr>, as
                        they contain demonstrably archaic variants. Many of these must have
                        originated in Greek <abbr>mss.</abbr> that are no longer available to us, but even where
                        this is not the case, they may still give us insight into the theology and
                        mindset of early Christians.</p>
                    <p>The oldest Syriac version of the Gospels is the <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Diatessaron">Diatessaron</ref>
                        (also <hi rend="italic">ewangeliyon da-mḥallṭe</hi> ‘Gospel of the mixed’),
                        written in the early 170s. This version, probably produced by <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Tatian">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/771">Tatian</persName>
                        </ref>
                        and probably in Syriac rather than Greek, was quoted by such authors as <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Aphrahat">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/10">Aphrahaṭ</persName>
                        </ref> and Ephrem; the latter even composed a commentary on it.
                        It remained in liturgical use until at least the early 5th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, when it
                        lost its canonical status and was replaced by the four separate Gospels (<hi rend="italic">ewangeliyon da-mparrše</hi> ‘Gospel of the separated’).
                        Although it was suppressed by force to such an extent that we are left only
                        with quotations, there are reasons to believe that it influenced all later
                        versions. Quotations in Ephrem indicate that the Acts and Epistles had also
                        been translated by the 4th <abbr>cent.</abbr> It has been tentatively suggested that
                        these translations, or forerunners of them, might also go back to Tatian’s
                        efforts (Petersen).</p>
                    <p>The Vetus Syra or <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Old-Syriac-Version">Old Syriac
                            Version</ref> is the oldest version of the four separate Gospels. The
                        two surviving <abbr>mss.</abbr>, the Curetonianus and the Sinaiticus, both date back to
                        the 5th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, but they may be seen as two representatives of a translation
                        probably made in the middle of the 3rd <abbr>cent.</abbr> The <abbr>NT</abbr> Peshitta is the result
                        of a thorough revision of Old Syriac material, using slightly different
                        Greek <abbr>mss.</abbr> The differences between the Old Syriac and the Peshitta can be
                        explained on the basis of the different Greek texts used and the development
                        in the ideas on translation technique: the Peshitta is more literal. In the
                        time of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Rabbula-of-Edessa">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/26">Rabbula</persName>
                        </ref> this version quickly gained currency
                        as the standard version of the Syriac <abbr>NT</abbr>, replacing the Diatessaron and
                        other early translations. The <abbr>NT</abbr> Peshitta also covers the Acts and Epistles,
                        apart from 2 Peter, 2–3 John, and Jude; it also omitted Revelation.</p>
                    <p>As stated above, for theological reasons Philoxenos of Mabbug preferred a
                        more precise rendering of the Greek, which Polykarpos made for him in 507/8.
                        This Philoxenian Version was a revision of the Peshitta. There has been
                        considerable confusion between this version and the <choice>

                        </ref>. On the basis of
                        Philoxenos’s Gospel commentaries, Brock has demonstrated that the
                        Philoxenian is lost, apart from Philoxenos’s own quotations and perhaps a
                        6th-cent. translation of the Minor Catholic Epistles and Revelation. The
                        Ḥarqlean, which covers all 27 <abbr>NT</abbr> books, shares many characteristics with the
                        Syro-Hexapla, which was made in the same place, the <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/The-Enaton">

                        of the Philoxenian with the aim of producing a mirror translation of the
                        Greek. Tuma strove to achieve a formal equivalence between Greek and Syriac
                        which extended sometimes even below word level.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">The Syriac Canon</label>
                    <p>Syriac biblical <abbr>mss.</abbr> usually contain no more than one book or a small group
                        of books, for instance the Pentateuch, the ‘Book of the Women’ (Ruth,
                        Susanna, Esther, and Judith), or the <hi rend="italic">Beth Mawtbe</hi> ‘the
                        Book of Sessions’ (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Proverbs, Qohelet, Ruth,
                        Song of Songs, Bar Sira, and Job; especially in the E.-Syr. tradition).
                        Differences between the very few early <hi rend="italic">pandects</hi>
                        containing the whole <abbr>OT</abbr> show that neither the Syriac canon of the <abbr>OT</abbr> nor the
                        order of books had been defined in the first millenium. Though there are
                        reasons to believe that Chronicles, Ezra-Nehemiah, Esther, Job, and Song of
                        Songs did not form part of the canon in earlier centuries (Haelewyck), the
                        books of the Hebrew Bible are all present in these <hi rend="italic">pandects</hi>. The situation with regard to the so-called Apocrypha or
                        Deuterocanonical works, on the other hand, still differs from <hi rend="italic">pandect</hi> to <hi rend="italic">pandect</hi>. The Milan
                        <abbr>ms.</abbr> (7a1) even contains part of Flavius <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Josephus">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/577">Josephus</persName>
                        </ref>’s ‘Jewish
                        War’. The order of books is often chronological, in which Job, identified
                        with Jobab of Gen. 10:29, is placed directly after the Pentateuch.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the <abbr>NT</abbr>, the <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Addai-Teaching-of">Teaching of
                            Addai</ref> states that members of the church are to read the Gospel,
                        the Epistles of Paul, and the Book of Acts. During the first centuries, ‘the
                        Gospel’ referred to the Diatessaron. As stated above, Ephrem already knew
                        the four separate Gospels in the Old Syriac Version; he referred to them as
                        ‘the Greek’. Only in the time of Rabbula the Peshitta with its four-Gospel
                        canon replaced the Diatessaron. It contained a total of 22 books, as it did
                        not include 2 Peter, 2–3 John, Jude, and Revelation (cf. also <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Apocalypses">Apocalypses</ref>). This canon, also known from Antiochene authors, no
                        longer included the additional (3rd) epistle to the Corinthians which is
                        quoted in Ephrem’s Commentary on the Pauline Epistles (Armenian). It may
                        also have ‘promoted’ 1 Peter and 1 John, which were known to Ephrem but
                        probably not considered canonical by him. 2 Peter, 2–3 John, Jude, and
                        Revelation were translated for the first time in the 6th <abbr>cent.</abbr> (possibly as
                        part of the version made by Polykarpos for Philoxenos) and are also present
