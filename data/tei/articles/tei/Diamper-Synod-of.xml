                    <p>Prior to the Synod of Diamper, the Thomas Christians had been ruled by E.

                        in Kerala in 1558 — by <abbr>Chald.</abbr> bishops. At the same time, the second half of
                        the 16th <abbr>cent.</abbr> had seen an increase in the activities of Latin missionaries
                        in Kerala and moves by the Portuguese to strengthen their control over the
                        Thomas Christians, who were indispensable for them as partners in the spice
                        trade, with the result, for example, that the <abbr>Chald.</abbr>
                        <abbr> bp.</abbr> Mar Abraham, who
                        had arrived in India in 1568, was summoned in 1585 to attend the Third
                        Provincial Council of Goa and was made to agree to the introduction of a
                        number of Latin practices in the liturgy of the Thomas Christians.</p>
                    <p>Following the death of Mar Abraham in 1597, Archbishop Aleixo (Alexis) de
                        Menezes of Goa (1559–1617, Archbishop of Goa 1595–1612) arrived in Kerala in
                        Jan. 1599. After gaining the support of the local rulers and some of the
                        local clergy, partly by ordaining a large number of new priests, and forcing
                        Archdeacon George of the Cross (archdeacon 1594–1640), the leader of the
                        Thomas Christians, to submit to him, Menezes called for a synod to be
                        convened in June 1599. Udayamperur, more easily accessible from the
                        Portuguese stronghold at Kochi than the traditional center of the diocese at
                        Angamali, was chosen as the venue of the synod.</p>
                    <p>The synod, attended by 153 local priests and 660 lay representatives, lasted
                        from the 20th to the 27th of June, and passed more than 200 decrees in rapid
                        succession and evidently without any serious debate. The decrees covering
                        doctrinal, liturgical, and customary matters were designed to bring the
                        Church of the Thomas Christians in line with the post-Tridentine Roman
                        Church, as well as to sever her links with the E.-Syr. (Chald.) Church, and
                        included condemnations of ‘Nestorian’ heresy and prohibition of any
                        recognition of the ‘Patriarch of Babylon’.</p>
                    <p>The Jesuit Francisco Ros (Roz), writing in 1604, reported that Menezes had
                        altered the text of the acts and decrees of the synod which he sent to Rome
                        after the synod had ended, and there are indeed significant differences
                        between the Malayalam text of the decrees and the text which was made known
                        in Europe, although we cannot be sure that the Malayalam text we have today,
                        preserved only in 18th-cent. <abbr>mss.</abbr>, faithfully represents the decrees as read
                        out and passed at the synod. Serious doubts have also been cast on the
                        canonical validity of the synod itself by scholars including J. Thaliath.
                        Valid or not, however, the synod and its decrees, the latter somewhat
                        modified at the diocesan synod of 1603 and by the so-called Rozian Statutes
                        of 1606, were to determine the way of life and the course of events for the
                        Thomas Christians, especially those who remained in communion with Rome, in
                        the subsequent centuries.</p>
                    <p>After the synod, Menezes remained in Kerala until Nov. 1599 and made a tour
                        of the diocese, during which books preserved in the local churches were
                        submitted to his entourage for examination and those deemed heretical were
                        consigned to the flame. It is believed that a large proportion of those
                        Syriac <abbr>mss.</abbr> which were in Kerala at the time were lost in this way, although
                        it is difficult now to determine the exact extent of the loss.</p>
                    <p>In Dec. 1599, Ros was appointed new <abbr>bp.</abbr> of the diocese of Angamali, which was
                        now formally placed under the Portuguese Padroado and made suffragan to the
                        archdiocese of Goa, although it regained its archiepiscopal status in name
                        in 1608 (the see was transferred around the same time to
                        Kodungallur/Cranganore). Ros was followed by a succession of Jesuit
                        archbishops. The dissatisfaction of the Thomas Christians with their rule
                        was to lead to the revolt against them at the Coonan Cross Oath of 1653 and
                        the subsequent division of the Thomas Christians between those who remained
                        in communion with Rome and those who turned to the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> Church.</p>
