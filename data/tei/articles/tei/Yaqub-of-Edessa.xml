                        which was by then under Muslim control. He was ordained by his friend the

                        appointed <abbr>bp.</abbr> of Edessa. However, he resigned after only a few years over
                        what he regarded as a lax attitude to canon law with which he refused to
                        compromise. He made a public demonstration of his position by burning a copy
                        of the canons in front of the residence of the <abbr>Patr.</abbr> Yulyanos. He then went
                        to the Monastery of Mor Yaʿqub at Kaysum, near Samosata, and wrote two
                        treatises, one of them against those who broke canon law. Subsequently he
                        was invited to the Monastery of Eusebona to teach the Psalms and the reading
                        of Scripture in Greek: although he was a Syriac-speaker and wrote
                        exclusively in Syriac, Yaʿqub was an enthusiastic proponent of Greek
                        language, literature, and Miaphysite theology. But after eleven years he was
                        forced to leave because of the anti-Greek attitude prevalent in the convent.

                        of the Old Testament. In 708 Ḥabbib, who had replaced Yaʿqub as <abbr>bp.</abbr> of
                        Edessa, died, and Yaʿqub was recalled to the bishopric. However, he himself
                        died only four months later on 5 June at Tell ʿAda, to which he had returned
                        in order to fetch his library and students. He was buried there, and

                    <p>9. The first systematic Syriac grammar. It survives only in fragmentary form,
                        but it was an important influence on <ref rend="bold"

                        grammatical work. In the examples he gave of grammatical rules, Yaʿqub used
                        Greek vowel letters inserted into the consonantal text (similar forms can be
                        found in his Sam <abbr>ms.</abbr>), and this method was modified by his successors to
                        become the now familiar W.-Syr. system. Yaʿqub also wrote a letter to
                        Giwargis <abbr>bp.</abbr> of Serugh on orthography.</p>
                    <p>10. Liturgical works: Yaʿqub revised the liturgy of St. James, wrote the
                        ‘Book of Treasures’ which included orders and prayers for baptism,
                        consecration of the waters on the eve of Epiphany, and marriage. He
                        translated the <hi rend="italic">Sedro</hi> of Severus for baptism, and
                        composed a horologium with services for the hours of the week, and a
                        calendar of feast days.</p>
                    <p>11. Several prose homilies: on the Eucharistic sacrifice, unleavened bread,
                        against Dyophysites, and against transgressors of canon law. Two metrical
                        homilies, on the Trinity and Incarnation, and on Faith against the Ch. of
                        E., have been attributed to Yaʿqub, but his authorship of the latter is
                        disputed.</p>
