                    <p>From the earliest period of Christian history, contacts and interaction
                        existed between Egypt and the Syriac world. For some of the Coptic writings
                        of the Nag Hammadi Library, such as the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of
                        Philip, the existence of a Syriac original has often been presumed, going
                        back to the 2nd <abbr>cent.</abbr> Even if such a Syr. original once existed, it is
                        unclear whether the Coptic translation would have been made directly from
                        Syr. or from a Greek intermediary. For the five Coptic <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Solomon-Odes-of">Odes of
                            Solomon</ref> that are incorporated in the Gnostic collection known as
                        ‘Pistis Sophia’ (generally dated to the 2nd half of the 3rd <abbr>cent.</abbr>), the
                        source language was almost certainly Greek (regardless of whether the Odes
                        were originally written in Greek or Syr.). Some Coptic Manichean texts,
                        however, were translated directly from a (lost) Syr. original, and recent
                        discoveries in the Dakhla oasis have provided fascinating evidence of the
                        immediate coexistence of Coptic and Manichean Syr. (or at any rate an
                        Aramaic dialect, very close to Syr. in both language and script). The Dakhla
                        findings include, among other things, some wooden tablets with a Syr.-Coptic
                        glossary (<abbr>ed.</abbr> Franzmann).</p>
                    <p>Within the Christian Roman Empire, contacts between Christians in Egypt and
                        in Syria and Mesopotamia intensified. Egyptian desert asceticism attracted
                        interest and visits from Syr. Christians, and several writings about the
                        Desert Fathers became known in Syr. as early as the 5th <abbr>cent.</abbr> It is very
                        telling that the later Syr. tradition of the <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Ephrem-Life-of">Life of
                            Ephrem</ref> lets Ephrem travel to Egypt and spend several years in
                        Scetis, where he met with Bishoi, one of the founders of Coptic monasticism
                        (a legend that lives on in <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/al-Suryan-Dayr">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/360">Dayr

                        </ref> to the present day). This should be seen as part of the
                        process of ‘egyptianization’ of Syr. asceticism (Becker), which tended to
                        legitimization in the Egyptian tradition of desert asceticism, by giving
                        precedence to texts and persons of Egyptian origin, by re-identifying the
                        authors of existing works as Egyptians, and even by inventing Egyptian
                        founding fathers of asceticism, such as <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Awgen-Mar">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/356">Mar Awgen</persName>

                    <p>In the development of Christian doctrine, the patriarchates of Alexandria and
                            <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Antioch">

                        </ref> played an equally important role. Tensions between the
                        two patriarchates, however, came to the fore and formed much of the
                        background against which the Council of Ephesus (431) was held, which was
                        seen as a victory for <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Cyril-of-Alexandria">

                        </ref>, the
                        latter being associated with Antiochene Christianity. In the wake of the
                        Council, however, reconciliation between Antiochene and Alexandrian bishops
                        took place (433). The subsequent Christological debate brought many Egyptian
                        and Syr. Christians closer together in their rejection of the two-nature
                        formula of the Council of Chalcedon (451), to which they opposed the
                        ‘Miaphysite’ doctrine of the one nature in Christ, in which both the full
                        humanity and full divinity are preserved. While both Egyptian and Syr.
                        Christians were divided between Chalcedonians and anti-Chalcedonians, the
                        latter were able in the course of the 6th <abbr>cent.</abbr> to build a church structure
                        that became the foundation for the Miaphysite Coptic Orthodox Church in
                        Egypt and for the Miaphysite <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> Church in Syria. They did so in
                        defiance of the imperial authorities who, after some hesitation in the late
                        5th and early 6th <abbr>cent.</abbr> resolutely chose for strict adherence to Chalcedon
                        with the accession of Emperor Justin I (518). <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Severus-of-Antioch">

                        forged a strong alliance with the Church of Alexandria, arguing that in
                        times of oppression the two Churches needed to act as one. Severus won for
                        himself lasting authority in both the Syr. and the Coptic churches. At his
                        death (538), the Syr. Miaphysites turned for leadership to <ref rend="bold"

                        Miaphysites in Egypt and in Syria should be united. It was only in the late
                        550s that attempts were made to reestablish an independent <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>
                        patriarch. Towards the end of the 6th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, a theological dispute broke out

                        throughout the 6th <abbr>cent.</abbr>). Although the Coptic and Syr. Miaphysite Churches
                        henceforth existed as separate churches, there was full doctrinal agreement,
                        which opened the way to different ways of contact and interaction.
                        Particularly important was the exchange of a ‘synodical letter’ at the
                        election of a new patriarch, expressing and reaffirming the communion
                        between the two Churches. Throughout the 6th <abbr>cent.</abbr> the language of
                        communication between the Alexandrians and Antiochenes was Greek, and the
                        Coptic translations of Severus’s oeuvre are based on the Greek originals,
                        not on the Syr. translations. In the early Islamic period, the language of
                        communication quickly became Arabic, while Syr. and Coptic continued to be
                        used within the individual churches.</p>
                    <p>The absence of any dogmatic barrier made it possible for Syr. Christians to
                        fully integrate into the Coptic Church. This happened on different levels.
                        On the highest level, four Christians of Syr. origin or descent served as
                        <abbr>patr.</abbr> of the Coptic Church (Damian: 579–605; Simon  I: 692–700; Afrahām <abbr>b.</abbr>
                        Zurʿa: 975–78; and Murqus <abbr>b.</abbr> Zurʿa: 1166–1189), while a fifth Syrian, the
                        monk Samuel, was close to being elected in 1092 (Den Heijer 2004). It is not
                        uncommon in the colophons of Syr. <abbr>mss.</abbr> (mostly but not exclusively in those
                        written in Egypt) as well as in Syr. inscriptions to find references to both
                        the Syr. and the Coptic patriarch (Kaufhold). Monks of Syr. origin lived in
                        various monasteries in Egypt, where they sometimes produced Syr.
                        inscriptions, and collected or wrote Syr. <abbr>mss.</abbr> Some of these monasteries are
                        explicitly mentioned in colophons of Syr. <abbr>mss.</abbr>, such as the Monastery of Mar

                        <abbr>mss.</abbr> (along with the Syr. ones, which started being written in the monastery
                        no later than the 10th <abbr>cent.</abbr>). While the status of the monastery between the
                        Coptic and Syr. world has received much attention in recent scholarship, the
                        disappearance of the Syr. element in the early 17th <abbr>cent.</abbr> should be seen
                        rather as the gradual absorption of the Syr. monks into the mainstream of
                        Coptic life than as a radical linguistic or cultural shift within the
