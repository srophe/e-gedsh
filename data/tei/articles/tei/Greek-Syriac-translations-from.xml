                        the late 9th <abbr>cent.</abbr> an enormous number of Greek texts were translated into
                        Syriac.<note/>

                    <p>Over the course of some 500 years, from the late 4th to the late 9th <abbr>cent.</abbr> an
                        enormous number of Greek texts were translated into Syriac. These
                        translations fall into three main categories: biblical texts in Greek;
                        patristic texts (by far the largest surviving category); secular texts
                        (medicine, philosophy, uplifting literature). With the exception of an
                        8th-cent. translation of Homer’s ‘Iliad’ (surviving only in some short
                        excerpts), no Classical Greek poetry was ever translated, an indication that
                        the motivation for undertaking translations was essentially utilitarian in
                        character. Syriac scholars played a significant role in the ‘translation
                        movement’ of the late 8th and 9th  centuries under Abbasid patronage, which
                        provided the Arabic-speaking world with the Greek intellectual heritage of
                        Late Antiquity; their contribution was especially important during the
                        earlier years of this movement, seeing that there was a long tradition of
                        translation from Greek into Syriac, but none yet from Greek into Arabic; for
                        this reason many translators (including the most famous of them all, <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Hunayn-b-Ishaq">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/542">Ḥunayn

                        </ref>) first translated from Greek into Syriac, and then from
                        Syriac into Arabic.</p>
                    <p>In quite a number of cases, the Greek original of a work has been lost, and
                        only the Syriac translation survives. This applies above all to patristic
                        authors whose works were subsequently suppressed in the Greek Church, such
                        as those of <ref rend="bold"

                        preserve a work lost in Greek; examples of this include <ref rend="bold"

                        </ref>’s ‘Homilies on Luke’. A number of secular writings
                        whose Greek original is lost are preserved in Syriac translation, such as
                        Themistius’s ‘On Virtue’ and Alexander of Aphrodisias’s ‘On the Universe
                            (<hi rend="italic">kosmos</hi>)’. Even where the Greek original survives
                        the Syriac translation may often be of considerable importance for editors
                        of the Greek, since the Syriac translations were not only made at a date
                        much earlier than that of the earliest Greek <abbr>mss.</abbr>, but also they are not
                        infrequently preserved in <abbr>mss.</abbr> that date from the 6th and even
                        5th centuries. On the other hand, sometimes the earliest Syriac translations
                        are so free that they are difficult to use for text-critical purposes,
                        whereas it is the later translations, of the 6th and 7th centuries, which
                        are the most useful, in view of their much more literal character.</p>
                    <p>During this half millennium of translation activity a marked shift in
                        translation style can be observed, moving away from free and reader-oriented
                        translations to literal and text-oriented ones; the culmination of this
                        process occurred in the 7th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, whereas during the ‘translation movement’
                        there was a return to a more reader-oriented approach. These changes in
                        translation fashion led to many revisions being made of earlier
                        translations.</p>

                        Nazianzus’s poems got translated. In the <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr> Theodore of Mopsuestia
                        was regarded as the ‘Exegete’ par excellence, while among the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> it
                        was Cyril of Alexandria and Severus who were held in particular honor. Since
                        most 5th-cent. translations were free in character (and are sometimes
                        paraphrases, rather than translations), a need was felt in the 6th and 7th
                        <abbr>cent.</abbr> for either a revision of the earlier translation, or an entirely new
                        one, keeping much closer to the Greek original. Thus the Homily collections
                        of both Gregory of Nazianzus and Severus underwent thorough revisions in the
                        7th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, the former undertaken by <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Pawla-of-Edessa">

                        of the century. The motivation for these revisions was sometimes the need
                        for greater exactitude in the rendering of key theological terms, something
                        which often resulted in the creation of neologisms in Syriac (an aspect
                        commented upon by Yaʿqub of Edessa himself in his ‘Letter on
                        Orthography’).</p>
                    <p>3. Secular: The earliest Syriac translations of Greek secular literature were
                        in the area of popular philosophy with an ethical content, and were mostly
                        made in the 5th <abbr>cent.</abbr> Surviving texts include works by Plutarch, Lucian, and

                        a few hagiographical) texts were translated; amongst these, several poetic
