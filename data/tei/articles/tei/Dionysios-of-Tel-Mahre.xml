                        to another monastery and eventually to the Monastery of Mar Yaʿqub at

                        Theodoros of the same monastery, Dionysios was elected <abbr>patr.</abbr> Then, in three
                        successive days he was ordained deacon, priest, and patriarch (Michael,

                    <p>At the very beginning of his pontificate he had to face opposition from
                        Abraham, whom Dionysios calls Abiram (<choice>

                        his followers of the Monastery of Gubba Barraya. The group was schismatic
                        (Abraham ordained his own bishops), but also held dissenting views in the
                        matter of the liturgical formula <hi rend="italic">Panem caelestem
                            frangimus</hi> (‘We break the heavenly bread’), which they wished to be
                        accepted by the whole <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> Church. The conflict in this matter had
                        been troubling the Church already during the pontificate of Dionysios’s
                        predecessor, <abbr>Patr.</abbr> 
                  <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Quryaqos">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/145">Quryaqos</persName>
                        </ref>. As it
                        proved impossible to solve it, the synod of Kallinikos, at which Dionysios
                        was elected, accepted that the usage of the formula was at the discretion of
                        every <abbr>bp.</abbr> However not even this tolerant solution was accepted by Abraham’s
                        group. Dionysios however succeeded in appeasing at least the people and
                        monks of the diocese of Cyrrhus, who previously had supported Abraham. The
                        latter repeatedly presented himself to the Muslim authorities as the
                        legitimate <abbr>patr.</abbr>, but without receiving official recognition (Michael 507,
                        508–12 / III, 49, 55–9), due to Dionysios’s intervention. In 820 Dionysios
                        went to <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Baghdad">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/41">Baghdad</placeName>
                        </ref> where he received the confirmation of his election from
                        Caliph al-Maʾmūn. In 829, after long talks with the caliph, Dionysios
                        obtained from him a decree to the effect that non-legitimate bishops would
                        not be officially approved by the Muslims. In this way Abraham no longer
                        presented a threat to Dionysios’s authority or the unity of the Church. He
                        died in 837, but the schism nevertheless continued, as Abraham’s supporters
                        elected his brother Shemʿun counter-patriarch. Some bishops, however, turned
                        their allegiance to Dionysios, so that this later phase of the schism was
                        less troublesome, as Dionysios himself reports (Chronicle of 1234,
                        234/206).</p>
                    <p>Another problem Dionysios had to face was the opposition of the eastern
                        (maphrianate) bishops, among whom the main figure was Basil <abbr>bp.</abbr> of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Tagrit">

                        </ref>.
                        As he antagonised also the Muslims of his diocese, he was arrested by the
                        Muslim authorities, which however also led to anti-Christian acts of
                        violence, including destruction of churches, <choice>

                        Dionysios, together with his brother, <ref rend="bold"

                        </ref>, went to Egypt to meet Emir ʿAbdallāh, from whom he
                        received an edict commanding any further destruction of churches to stop and
                        to rebuild the ones that had been destroyed (Michael, 516 / III, 63–4).</p>
                    <p>Dionysios’s relations with the Muslim authorities were so good that on the
                        caliph’s request he even intervened far beyond his own jurisdiction, namely
                        in the matters of a group of Coptic Christians, known as Bashmurites, who
                        had revolted against their Muslim oppressors. It seems that thanks to his
                        intervention the caliph did not punish them with death but deportation.</p>
                    <p>During his pontificate Dionysios ordained 99 bishops (Michael, 754–55 / III,
                        453–55). He died on 22 Aug. 845 and was buried in his former monastery of
                        Qenneshre.</p>
                    <p>Dionysios was the author of an historical work in two parts, dealing with
                        ecclesiastical (written earlier) and with secular matters, altogether in 16
                        books. Dedicated to <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Iwannis-of-Dara">

                    <p>Dionysios’s sources are not directly known, but the analyses by J.-B. Chabot

                        in the Chronicle to the year 724, and some other Syriac, but also Greek and
                        Arabic sources.</p>
                    <p>Due to an erroneous attribution by J. S. Assemani, Dionysios was until the
                        end of the 19th century considered to be the author of the anonymous <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Zuqnin-Chronicle-of">Chronicle of Zuqnin</ref>, which consequently became known as that of
                        Pseudo-Dionysios of Tel Maḥre.</p>
                    <p>Dionysios also promulgated some disciplinary canons, preserved in the
                        Synodicon of the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> Church (<abbr>ed.</abbr> Vööbus). Another text of his is his
                        profession of faith in Arabic, most probably one that he sent to the Coptic
                        <abbr>patr.</abbr> of Alexandria (as was customary for newly elected patriarchs of both
                        churches), in which, however, he says nothing about the current issues (the
