                        Nisibis as its metropolitan see, included the dioceses of Arzun, Qardu, Beth
                        Zabdai, Beth Rahimai, and Beth Moksaye, which all had large Armenian
                        populations and which occasionally show up as dioceses of the Armenian
                        Church. In these and in other borderlands, there must have been a
                        significant amount of bilingualism, reflecting a ‘veritable
                        interpenetration’ between the two groups (Garsoïan 1992, 63).</p>
                    <p>In the 1st <abbr>cent.</abbr> BC, the western part of Armenia was incorporated into the
                        Roman Empire, while the larger part (‘Great Armenia’) remained within the
                        Iranian sphere of influence, at times enjoying independence, at times ruled
                        by Parthian and later Sasanian monarchs. Around 387 the Roman and Sasanian
                        Empires agreed on a formal partition of Armenia (even though the frontier
                        subsequently shifted). Despite the fact that in its formative period
                        Armenian Christianity, not unlike Syr. Christianity, was divided over two
                        empires, this did not lead — as in the case of the Syrians — to doctrinal
                        division. This is often attributed to a stronger sense of ethnic and
                        cultural identity among the Armenians than among the Syrians. In the Islamic
                        period Armenians occasionally had their own kingdom, such as under the
                        Bagratid dynasty, from the end of the 9th to the middle of the 11th <abbr>cent.</abbr>
                        From the late 12th <abbr>cent.</abbr> to 1375, an independent Armenian kingdom existed in
                        Cilicia (‘Little Armenia’), where many Armenians had settled. Cilician
                        Armenia accepted union with Rome at the Council of Sis in 1307, but this
                        union, which failed to receive support outside Cilicia, came to an end with
                        the demise of the Cilician kingdom. In the Ottoman Empire, Armenians at
                        first flourished. The patriarchate of Constantinople (Istanbul) was created
                        to represent Armenian interests (and often other Christians’ interests as
                        well) at the capital. Armenians also lived in parts of Persia and Russia,
                        and there were diaspora communities as far as Lemberg (Galicia, present-day
                        Lwow in Poland). Significant emigration to Europe and North America started
                        in the middle of the 19th  cent. The early 20th <abbr>cent.</abbr> saw the Armenian
                        genocide, which largely coincided with the <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Sayfo">Sayfo</ref>, and which was
                        followed by further dispersion. The short-lived independent Armenian
                        Republic (1918– 1920) became part of the Soviet Union in 1920, to regain its
                        independence only in September 1991.</p>
                    <p>Christianity came to Armenia no later than the 3rd <abbr>cent.</abbr> and the Armenian
                        Church was first organized by Gregory the Illuminator in the early 4th <abbr>cent.</abbr>
                        An important factor in the development of Armenian Christianity was the
                        invention of the Armenian script by Maštoc‘ (Mesrop), traditionally dated in
                        or around 407, and preceded by Maštoc‘’s travels through Syria and Edessa.
                        This was followed by a period of intense translation activity, from both
                        Greek and Syriac. Prior to the invention of their own script, Armenians used
                        Greek and Syriac as their literary and liturgical languages.</p>
                    <p>Among the translations of the earliest period (first half of the 5th <abbr>cent.</abbr>)
                        are several Syriac texts, such as the Demonstrations of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Aphrahat">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/10">Aphrahaṭ</persName>

                        Armenian works include the undoubtedly genuine ‘Hymns on Nicomedia’, which
                        were written shortly after 358, and of which only a few Syriac fragments
                        exist (<abbr>ed.</abbr> Renoux), and the Commentary on the <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Diatessaron">Diatessaron</ref>
                        (<abbr>ed.</abbr> Leloir). While for these two works (as well as for Aphrahaṭ) we are
                        dealing with quite faithful translations of Syriac originals, the
                        relationship to the Syriac original is more problematic for other works
                        attributed to Ephrem, such as a collection of hymns (<abbr>ed.</abbr> Mariès and
                        Mercier), which seem to contain Syriac materials, but may represent later

                    <p>In the aftermath of the Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council’s
                        condemnation of Antiochene theology, Armenian Christianity moved away from
                        the Syriac sphere of influence and increasingly turned to the Greek imperial
                        church. The Council of Chalcedon (451) at first did not have an impact on
                        the Armenians, who at the same time were involved in the Battle of Avarayr
                        (the outcome of which led to full Sasanian rule over Armenia). It is only in
                        the course of the 6th <abbr>cent.</abbr> that church leaders and councils determined
                        Armenia’s own theological position, partly in response to missionary
                        activity carried out by representatives of the emerging Syr. Miaphysite
                        Church and of the Dyophysite E.-Syr. Church. Even though the Armenians

                        exchanges between Syr. and Armenian Christians continued throughout the
                        centuries. In the early Islamic period, both the <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr> and the Syr.
                        Orth. Church had a presence in parts of the Armenian lands. Since the 8th
                        <abbr>cent.</abbr>, there was in Khilat (or Akhlat), on the western shore of Lake Van, an
                        E.-Syr. metropolitan <abbr>bp.</abbr> as well as a <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>

                        Terter River (Van Lantschoot 1932). The E.-Syr. metropolitan see of Khilat
                        was later given up as an independent see and added to Nisibis, whose

                        (Fiey, <hi rend="italic">Nisibe</hi>, 106). Translation activity from Syriac

                    <p>Among the cities in which Armenians and Syrians lived together for many
                        centuries, Edessa assumes a special position. The Armenian presence there
                        can be traced back to a very early period and some sources (including Yaʿqub
                        of Edessa, in his Chronicle) present king Abgar and the original population
                        of Edessa as Armenian. The story of Abgar’s conversion to Christianity
                        became widely popular in Armenian, whereby an increasing Armenization took
                        place, from its first attestation in Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History and
                        the 5th-cent. work attributed to Labubna, or Łerubna (the Edessene king’s
                        scribe who is also mentioned in the Syr. <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Addai-Teaching-of">Teaching of

                        Arcruni and Uxtanes. When the short-lived Crusade principality of Edessa
                        fell to the Seljuks in 1144, the Armenians were bewildered as much as the
                        Syr. Christians were (see Dionysios bar Ṣalibi), as is shown by the lament
                        written by Nerses Shnorhali (<abbr>ET</abbr> van Lint), the later <abbr>Cath.</abbr> of all Armenians
                        (1166–99), who is known for his friendly relationship with Michael Rabo.</p>
                    <p>The contacts between Armenian and Syr. Christians are also reflected in art,
                        as is illustrated in the 9th-cent. illuminated Gospel <abbr>ms.</abbr> of Queen Mlke
                        (Venice, San Lazzaro 1144), which has been connected with the Syriac <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Rabbula-Gospels">Rabbula Gospels</ref> (Stone <abbr>et al.</abbr>).</p>

                        lexica are attested, reflecting language contact and bilingualism. Both
