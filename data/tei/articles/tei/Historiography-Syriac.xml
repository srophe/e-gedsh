                    <p>The beginnings of writing history in Syriac remain unknown, but one may
                        connect it to the existence of notes on various events that were kept in the
                        royal archives of Osrhoene (although there must have been similar archives
                        in other <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Aramaic">Aramaic</ref>-speaking countries, <choice>
                            <sic>e.g.</sic>
                            <corr>e.g., </corr>
                        </choice>in <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Adiabene">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/993">Adiabene</placeName>
                        </ref>, we have
                        no information about them). The notes per se are not historiography, but
                        they could be used to construct a narrative of some kind about the past.
                        After the end of the kingdom of Osrhoene, the materials from the royal
                        archives, at least partly, found their way to the episcopal archives. This
                        can be inferred from the first W.-Syr. local chronicle that we know, the
                            <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Chronicle-of-Edessa">Chronicle of
                            Edessa</ref>, written soon after 532 in which local material from both
                        the pre-Christian epoch (such as the chronologically first note: ‘The year
                        180 [of the Seleucid era  = 132/1 BC]: kings began to reign in Edessa.’) and
                        Christian epoch was included.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Chronicle Writing</label>
                    <p>The Chronicle of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Edessa">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</placeName>
                        </ref> opens the
                        series of local chronicles (which occasionally also have notes on non-local
                        events, <choice>
                            <sic>e.g.</sic>
                            <corr>e.g., </corr>
                        </choice>on the birth of Jesus or the accession of Roman emperors). A
                        comparison of this Chronicle with other chronicles of similar character has
                        revealed that it is an excerpt from a more extensive, not extant, work
                        conventionally called the Original Chronicle of Edessa. Some of the notes
                        (lemmata) of the latter that are not present in the extant Chronicle of
                        Edessa can be found in other Syriac chronicles, <choice>
                            <sic>e.g.</sic>
                            <corr>e.g., </corr>
                        </choice>the Chronicle to the
                        year 819. In its first part it seems to have followed quite closely the
                        Original Chronicle of Edessa, but in the second part it notes other events:
                        a series of lemmata recount events connected with the <ref rend="bold"
                       target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Gabriel-Monastery-of-Mor">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/226">Monastery of Mor Gabriel</placeName>
                        </ref>, from which it may be inferred that its
                        author was a monk of that monastery.</p>
                    <p>What the local chronicles also have in common is their annalistic structure,
                        which means that they present historical events in short pieces of
                        information, called lemmata. These begin with a year date and state what
                        happened that year. A typical such lemma is for instance ‘The year 672:
                        Walgash, bishop of Nisibis, died...’.</p>
                    <p>There were certainly other chronicles of this type, which however have not
                        survived. We have several fragments of such works, sometimes only a few
                        folios long, but still valuable for the historical information they provide,
                        as for instance one very mutilated folio that brings information on the Arab
                        conquest of Syria in the beginning of the 7th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, or a fragment of a
                        Chronicle up to the year 813 (<hi rend="italic">Chronica minora</hi>, II
                        &amp; III).</p>
                    <p>In addition to historical information of local character soon another type of
                        historiographic literature developed, the so-called universal (or world)
                        chronicles. This genre was implanted in Syriac by translation of two
                        chronicles written in Greek, those of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Hippolytus-of-Rome">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/537">Hippolytus of
                            Rome</persName>
                        </ref> and <ref rend="bold"
                       target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Eusebius-of-Caesarea">

                        </ref>.</p>
                    <p>The first of them seems to have been intended not as a continuous exposition
                        of the events of world history, but rather as a gazetteer providing
                        geographical, ethnographical, and linguistic information on the then known
                        world, in addition to data on the early history of mankind, culled from the
                        Bible. The Chronicle of Hippolytus of Rome (d. 235), or rather its material
                        (as it had a complicated transmission history) is also known as the Division
                        of the earth (<hi rend="italic">Diamerismos tēs gēs</hi>), <choice>

                        sons of Noah, since geographical lists (of countries, mountains, rivers,
                        islands), ethnographical (of various peoples), linguistic (of languages
                        including those that have written literature), and historical were all
                        expressed within the account of the vicissitudes of the three sons of Noah
                        and their progeny. They were believed to have divided the world into their
                        respective possessions. In Syriac several versions of Hippolytos’s material
                        are known, sometimes only fragmentarily preserved, either as separate texts
                        (Peoples after the confusion of languages in Babylon, On the families of
                        languages), or  — more often — incorporated into larger works, be it

                    <p>The Chronicle of Eusebius of Caesarea (d. 339) had a very specific form,
                        called canons: it was written in the form of tables with parallel columns in
                        which the years of the rulers of all nations or states known to him were
                        enumerated (the so-called <hi rend="italic">fila regnorum</hi>), whereas on
                        both sides of these columns, the so-called <hi rend="italic">spatium
                            historicum</hi>, notes on various events were placed (Witakowski
                        1999–2000). The Chronicle was translated into Syriac in the 6th <abbr>cent.</abbr> It has
                        not been preserved, but it was used by many later Syr. chroniclers, thanks
                        to whom we know relatively well how it was structured and what it contained.
                        The work of Eusebius was expanded by later Greek chroniclers (Annianos [5th
                        <abbr>cent.</abbr>] and Andronikos [6th <abbr>cent.</abbr>]), who added material from the creation of
                        the world (Eusebius started his canons from Abraham) and continued its
                        narrative up to their time. These chronicles were translated into Syriac
                        too, but none of them is extant.</p>
                    <p>The earliest Syr. chronicle which used Eusebius’s work as its source is the
                        so-called Maronite Chronicle, written after 664. Its author supplemented the
                        Eusebian material with material from other sources and notes on the history
                        of the Maronites. He continued it until his own epoch, adding notes on the
                        history of the Arabs. The Maronite Chronicle does not have the column
                        form.</p>
                    <p>Even earlier than the work just named is the Melkite Chronicle, composed
                        after 638, which, however, did not use the Chronicle of Eusebius. It brings
                        Old Testament chronology, and for the Christian period, lists of patriarchs
                        of the main sees, becoming more informative only from the epoch of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Nestorius">

                        anti-Miaphysite anathemas (<abbr>ed.</abbr> de Halleux).</p>
                    <p>The Eusebian model is on the other hand clearly seen in the Chronicle of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yaqub-of-Edessa">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/113">Yaʿqub of Edessa</persName>
                        </ref> (d. 708). This work, only fragmentarily
                        preserved, has the column format of Eusebius. Yaʿqub did not copy Eusebius’s
                        work, only continued it. He provided material on the history of the Church,
                        of the Byzantine empire, and of Persia, a country which Eusebius totally
                        neglected, but which the Syr. historians for obvious reasons could not

                    <p>Eusebius’s influence in Syr. historiography is seen not only in chronography,
                        but also in another genre of history writing, namely ecclesiastical (or
                        church) history (Syr. <hi rend="italic">eqlisiyasṭiqi</hi>). Eusebius’s
                        Ecclesiastical History was very soon, in any case before the middle of the
                        5th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, translated into Syriac (Van Rompay 1994), and contrary to the
                        Chronicle it has been preserved, though with lacunae. It was used by later
                        Syr. historians, whereby the genre of ecclesiastical history was implanted
                        in Syriac historiography.</p>
                    <p>Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History found continuators in Greek too, and the
                        work of at least one of them, Socrates Scholasticus (d. <abbr>ca.</abbr> 450), was
                        translated into Syriac, and has been preserved both in excerpts and in an
                        abbreviated form (not published). Whether works of other continuators of

                        why copying his works in Greek was discontinued, whereas they have survived
                        in Syriac translations. The Syriac version of his Ecclesiastical History was
                        incorporated into a larger compilation supplied with hagiographical and

                        introducing a new genre: developed chronicle. The annalistic structure is
                        kept (though there are no canons) but the author often inserted material
                        from his sources in large extracts or in their entirety. His main sources
                        are the Bible, the Chronicle of Eusebius, the Ecclesiastical History of
                        Socrates, and that of Yuḥanon of Ephesus, while the last part contains his
                        own material. He used many other sources, including works which have been
                        subsequently lost (Witakowski 1987). One of such works, most probably copied
                        by him in its entirety, is the Chronicle of Pseudo-<ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yeshu-the-Stylite">

                        chronicle and ecclesiastical history was abolished.</p>
                    <p>It does not mean however that short chronicles were no longer composed. The
                        material published under the title of the Chronicle to the year 724
                        (anonymous, but see Palmer 1992) is actually not a chronicle in the meaning
                        of a planned and elaborate historiographic work, but a collection of series
                        of lemmata culled from various sources, including the Chronicle of
                        Hippolytus, the Chronicle of Eusebius, together with its Antiochene
                        Continuation (Burgess 1999), an account of Church councils, and a list of
                        Umayyad caliphs, put down one after another without the chronological order.
                        In fact for many lemmata dates are missing.</p>
                    <p>The Chronicle to the year 846 is again a short lemma chronicle. Although the
                        preserved text starts from the birth of Levi, the son of the Old Testament
                        patriarch Jacob (there are many lacunae further on in the text too), there
                        can be no doubt that it was a universal chronicle. It includes material
                        taken from several sources, such as the Chronicle of Eusebius for universal
                        history, and  — for local data — the Original Chronicle of Edessa, the

                        seen in his detailed notes on the events of the history of that city. Most
                        of them, it is true, were taken from the lost Edessene chronicle of Basil
                        Bar Shumana, the metropolitan of Edessa, but they continue even after the
                        date of the latter’s death (1171). The Chronicle was begun as a simple work
                        of universal history, but after the epoch of Constantine the abundance of
                        material to be dealt with caused the author to divide it into two parts,
                        ecclesiastical and secular. The Edessene author used many of the sources
                        that Michael Rabo did, but independently from him: he did not know Michael’s
                        work.</p>
                    <p>Dividing historiographical works into two parts became a solution also with

                    <p>The Chronicle of Eliya of Nisibis (d. 1046) is the only E.-Syr. universal
                        chronicle of the Eusebian type. In the first, so-called chronographical,
                        part Eliya, following Eusebius, gathered lists of Old Testament patriarchs,
                        kings, and rulers of various countries, together with an annotated list of
                        the catholicoi of the <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr> The next part, the canons, is written in
                        columns, but Eliya uses them in a different way from Eusebius. From right to
                        left they contain: 1. dates given in the Seleucid era, and, for the Muslim
                        period, in the era of Hijra; 2. the source of the entry (it is here that we
                        learn of many Syr. historiographic works that once existed), which as a
                        regularly recurring piece of information is exceptional in Syr. chronicle
                        writing; and 3. the actual lemmata given in two languages, Syriac and Arabic
                        (an indication that the Arabization of the E. Syrians had already made some
                        progress). Eliya’s sources include Eusebius’s Chronicle, Socrates’s
                        Ecclesiastical History, and W.-Syr. works: the Chronicle of Yuḥanon ‘the
                        Jacobite’, <choice>
