                        prominence as the regular residence of <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> Patriarchs in the
                        11th–13th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, the period often referred to as the <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Renaissance-Syriac">Syriac

                        located around a peak 1600 m high at the south-western end of the Kaplı
                        Dağı, above the village of Peraş (1300  m) in the upper valley of the Kâhta
                        Çayı and approximately 20 km. to the northeast of Nemrut Dağı, the site of
                        the ancient sanctuary built by Antiochus I of Commagene (70–38 BC), whence
                        the materials may have been brought that were used in the construction of
                        the vaults of the new church of the monastery in 1186 (Honigmann, 49).</p>
                    <p>The original monastery founded by Mor Barṣawmo probably lay at the foot of
                        the mountain near the Kâhta Çayı. The ‘upper’ monastery must have been built

                        (987–1003) normally resided at the Monastery of Barid, which was probably
                        located near the River Giḥun (Ceyhan) some way to the west of Dayro d-Mor
                        Barṣawmo, but Athanasios is recorded as having died in Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo,
                        and was succeeded by Yuḥanon bar ʿAbdun (1004–31), a monk of that monastery.

                        </ref> because of
                        persecution by Chalcedonians, and, with the exception of Athanasios  Ḥoye
                        (1058–63), his immediate successors normally resided outside areas under
                        Byzantine rule, but with the weakening of Byzantine control in the wake of
                        the Battle of Manzikert (1071), Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo and the surrounding
                        region became once again the center stage of <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> activities. Among
                        the patriarchs from that period, Basilios III (1074–75) and Athanasios bar
                        Kamore (1091–1129) were monks of Mor Barṣawmo. It is reported that measures
                        were taken to strengthen the fortification of the monastery in 1101 and
                        1164, measures which were necessitated by the attraction that the monastery
                        with its relic of Barṣawmo and its wealth exerted not only on pilgrims but
                        also on less welcome visitors, as well as by its precarious position on the
                        border between Frankish and Armenian territory to the south and Turkish
                        territory to the north. Among the events from the middle of the 12th <abbr>cent.</abbr>,
                        mention may be made of the plunder of the monastery by Count Joscelin II of
                            <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Edessa">

                        VI bar Qeṭreh (1138/9–66). The monastery saw its heyday under <abbr>Patr.</abbr>

                        under Michael  I, suffered serious damage by fire in 1183. Michael I was
                        succeeded as <abbr>patr.</abbr> by another abbot of Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, Rabban Ṣaliba,
                        who as <abbr>patr.</abbr> took the name Athanasios (1199–1207), while his rival <ref rend="bold"

                        Barṣawmo in the following period. Ignatius III Dawid (1222–52), although
                        originally a monk of the monastery, spent much of his patriarchate in
                        Armenian and Frankish territory at Qalʿa Rumoyto (Hromklay, Rum Kale) and

                        (1252–61) took up residence in the monastery and was joined there for a time

                        Philoxenos Nemrod (1283–92), a nephew of Shemʿun and Yaʿqub, seems normally
                        to have resided in Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, which was badly damaged by an

                        </ref>, the younger brother of Bar ʿEbroyo, was consecrated maphrian
                        in 1288. The monastery seems to have been deserted not long after the murder
                        in 1293 of Constantine, the Melitenian patriarchal claimant in the three-way
                        schism that followed the death of Philoxenos, and, after the extinction also
                        of the Cilician line of patriarchs, was replaced by <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/al-Zafaran-Dayr">

                    <p>The 15th <abbr>cent.</abbr> saw a revival of <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> activities in the area just to the
                        east of Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, centred around the town of Gargar (modern
                        Gerger) and the Monastery of Mor Abḥai. Dayro d-Mor Barṣawmo, too, was
                        reoccupied at that time, as is indicated by a number of manuscripts dated
                        between 1463 and 1675 that either mention or were copied in Dayro d-Mor
                        Barṣawmo. There has been yet another revival of <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> communities in
                        the area in recent years, leading to the appointment of a metropolitan for
                        Adıyaman (former Ḥisn Manṣūr) in 2006.</p>
                    <p>Another <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> monastery dedicated to Mor Barṣawmo was the ‘little
                        monastery’ (<hi rend="italic">dayrunitho</hi>) of Mor Barṣawmo near Kfartuto
                        to the southwest of Mardin, which is attested in 12th–13th <abbr>cent.</abbr> and was
                        situated between the villages of Bagdashiyya (modern Bektaş) and Ḥashray
                        (modern Dikmen) (Honigmann, 44–5; and colophons of <abbr>mss.</abbr> Vat. Syr. 147 and
                        Yale, Syriac 10).</p>
