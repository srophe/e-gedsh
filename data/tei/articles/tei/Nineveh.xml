                    <p>A very ancient city in northern Iraq located on the eastern side of the
                        Tigris River, directly across from the medieval and modern city of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Mosul">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/139">Mosul</placeName>
                        </ref>.
                        The site owed its earliest development, from <abbr>ca.</abbr> 6000 BC, to its position
                        beside a crossable portion of the Tigris (Oates 1968, 52). Nineveh reached
                        its apex in the 7th <abbr>cent.</abbr> BC, when it served as the capital of the
                        Neo-Assyrian Empire under Kings Sennacherib (<abbr>r.</abbr> 705–681 BC), Esarhaddon (<abbr>r.</abbr>
                        681–69 BC), and Ashurbanipal (<abbr>r.</abbr> 668–27 BC). The rediscovery of its royal
                        palaces played a central role in the development of modern Assyriology. In
                        1847, a thirty-year old Englishman named Austen Henry Layard began
                        excavations at the site and almost immediately uncovered the remains of
                        Sennacherib’s palace beneath the modern tell called Kuyunjik. Six years
                        later, in 1853, Layard’s former assistant, Hormuzd Rassam, a Chaldean
                        Christian from Mosul, excavated the palace of Ashurbanipal. Recent
                        scholarship has finally given Rassam due credit for this discovery, an
                        accomplishment obscured at the time by British Museum officials, who
                        attacked Rassam as an ‘Oriental’ unqualified to run the excavation
                        (Larsen 1994, esp. 317–32). British archaeologists continued to conduct
                        intermittent excavations at Nineveh over the next century, followed by the
                        Iraqis from the second half of the 1960s. American excavations (1987–1990)
                        found dramatic evidence for Nineveh’s destruction in 612 BC, when a combined
                        force of Medes, Elamites, and Babylonians burned and pillaged the city
                        (Stronach and Lumsden 1992).</p>
                    <p>In both ancient and modern culture, Nineveh’s destruction has often served as
                        an evocative paradigm for the sudden collapse of a mighty empire. But as
                        stories about the destruction of Assyrian Nineveh percolated in Classical
                        and Near Eastern folklore, the city itself experienced a long, slow
                        recovery, eventually re-emerging as a significant urban center and then
                        bishopric. Under the Seleucids, the city was re-founded as a <hi rend="italic">polis</hi> and received ‘at least the superficial forms of
                        Hellenistic city organization’ (Oates 1968, 61). Greek inscriptions and
                        sculptural fragments attest to the strength of the city’s Hellenistic
                        culture as late as the 2nd <abbr>cent.</abbr> AD (Reade 1998). Not surprisingly,
                        Hellenistic and indigenous traditions often intertwined or merged (Reade
                        2001, 198).</p>
                    <p>By the early 3rd <abbr>cent.</abbr> AD, Christianity had established a significant
                        presence in the surrounding territory of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Adiabene">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/993">Adiabene</placeName>
                        </ref>, which
                        operated as a semi-autonomous kingdom, with its capital at <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Arbela">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/13">Arbela</placeName>
                        </ref> (modern
                        Erbil), until the Sasanian conquests of the 220s. When and how Christianity
                        arrived in Nineveh remains unclear. Local tradition among the modern
                        Christians of Mosul holds that a monastery dedicated to the Prophet Jonah
                        was built on the tell of Nabī Yūnus during the 4th <abbr>cent.</abbr> (Fiey 1965, vol. 2,
                        497–8). But there is no indisputable textual or archaeological evidence for
                        Christianity at the site until the mid-6th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, when <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Ahudemmeh">

                        </ref> (Fiey 1993, 115–16). At some stage before the mid-9th

                        grown rapidly following its foundation as an Arab camp (<hi rend="italic">miṣr</hi>) in the 640s.</p>
                    <p>Nineveh also served as the base for a <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> bishopric, closely
                        associated with the nearby <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Matay-Dayro-d-Mor">

                        </ref> (Fiey 1965, 349–53; idem 1993, 239–40). One of the first
                        holders of the bishopric, Mar Zakkay (593–605), distinguished himself as an
                        intrepid polemicist against the ‘Nestorians’ (Fiey 1965, vol. 2, 783; idem
                        2004, 197–98). After the victory of the Emperor Heraclius at the Battle of
                        Nineveh in 626, the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> expanded their presence throughout the entire
                        region. A <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> school established at Nineveh in the early 7th <abbr>cent.</abbr>

                    <p>Local Christians recognized Nineveh as the former capital of the Neo-Assyrian
                        Empire, but their understanding of this past was fragmentary, distorted, and
                        sometimes fantastic. Stories about imperial Nineveh included the aphorisms

                        Biblical books of Tobit and Jonah. Syr. Christians had long been fascinated
                        by the story of the Ninevites’ repentance (Jonah 3:1–10), an episode that
                        inspired a popular <hi rend="italic">memrā</hi> by the poet <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Ephrem">

                        Sometime between the late 560s and the mid-7th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, the Rogation of the
                        Ninevites was adopted as a formal festival of the <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr> to celebrate the
                        passing of the plague (Fiey 1965, 498, esp. n. 5, on the problem of the
                        dating). The Rogation, also known as the Fast of the Ninevites, continues to
                        be celebrated with great intensity and three-day fasts in some E.-Syr.
                        communities today.

                    <p>The archaeology of Christianity at Nineveh has only recently begun to receive
                        close attention (Simpson 2005). Christian objects found during the British
                        excavations include fragments of a painted stucco cross and a small brass
                        lamp with a cross-shaped lid. Unfortunately, the famous monastery of Jonah,
                        which stood atop the modern tell of Nabī Yūnus, is known only from textual
                        sources. In 701, the ill-fated E.-Syr. <abbr>Patr. </abbr>

                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/531">Ḥenanishoʿ</persName>
                        </ref> was buried in the monastery, and its chapel was
                        restored by the <abbr>Patr.</abbr> Sargis (860–72). By this time, the monastery had also
                        become a favorite haunt for the revelries of Islamic visitors, who penned
                        enthusiastic verses about its wine (Fiey 1965, 2, 500). At some point in the
                        10th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, if not before, the monastery was transformed into an Islamic
                        shrine (<hi rend="italic">masjad</hi>) dedicated to the prophet Jonah (Nabī
                        Yūnus). This mosque remains to this day a much-venerated shrine visited by
                        members of all the religious communities of the region.</p>
                    <p>Gradually, beginning in late antiquity, the countryside surrounding Nineveh
                        filled with a mixture of villages belonging to either the <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr> or the
                        <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> Church, often living in close proximity to local Muslims, Jews,
                        and Yazidis. Many of these villages developed strong local traditions of
                        Christian architecture and scribal activity (Fiey 1965, vol. 2, 354–491).
                        Even in the modern Diaspora, the distinct identity of many of these
                        Christian villages, such as <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Telkepe">
