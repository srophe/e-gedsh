                        and Damascus. Qara’s Christian history can be traced back to the 5th <abbr>cent.</abbr>
                        (mentioned as Chonachara or Chonochara). In the Christological controversies
                        of the 5th and 6th <abbr>cent.</abbr> it was on the side of the Chalcedonians. After a
                        long period during which the sources are silent, Qara reemerges around 1100,
                        still as a center of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Melkite">Melkite</ref>
                        Christianity. <abbr>Bp.</abbr> Michael of Qara is attested for the second half of the
                        12th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, and he himself has left us a list of some of his predecessors
                        (Schmidt, 27–9). The Muslim authors Ibn Jubayr (who visited Qara in July
                        1184) and Yāqūt (1225) report that in their day Qara was entirely Christian.
                        In 1266, however, Sultan Baybars, in his offensive against the Crusaders and
                        Mongols, expelled or killed the Christians of Qara, which then became a
                        Muslim town. It was able to regain some of its Christian population in the
                        following decades and to recreate its episcopal see, no later than <abbr>ca.</abbr> 1400.
                        In the first half of the 15th <abbr>cent.</abbr>
                        <abbr> Bp.</abbr> Makarios built a scriptorium in Dayr
                        Mar Yaʿqub, in which a number of Syriac and Arabic <abbr>mss.</abbr> were produced,
                        mostly by bps. and priests belonging to some influential families. In the
                        17th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, due to the ongoing islamization of the Qalamun region, the
                        episcopal see of Qara lost its independence and was joined together with
                        Ṣaydnāyā. The Monastery of Mar Yaʿqub, which had lost some of its earlier
                        prestige, was destroyed by an earthquake in 1759 and remained in ruins. In
                        the 18th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, Qara moved into the orbit of the Melkite-Catholic Church, to
                        which most of the small Christian minority of Qara’s population nowadays
                        belong.</p>
                    <p>Today Qara has two historically important Christian sites, both of which are
                        still in use. One is the Church of Sts. Sergius and Bacchus; the other is
                        Dayr Mar Yaʿqub, just outside the town. The Church of Sergius and Bacchus
                        contains partly preserved <ref rend="bold"
                       target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Wall-paintings-in-Syria-and-Lebanon">wall paintings</ref>, some of which have inscriptions in
                        Greek and Syriac Esṭrangela). The upper parts of
                        five scenes are preserved on the north wall of the church: the breastfeeding
                        Virgin, flanked by two equestrian saints, Theodore (left) and Sergius
                        (right); John the Baptist; and (traces of) an unidentified female saint.</p>
                    <p>
                        Dayr Mar Yaʿqub, dedicated to the E.-Syr. saint Yaʿqub ‘the mutilated’ (‘the dissected’, Syr. <hi rend="italic">mpassqā</hi>, Arab. <hi rend="italic">muqaṭṭa</hi>ʿ, or
                        Lat. Intercisus; cf. Fiey, <hi rend="italic">Saints syriaques</hi>, 107–8),
                        is first attested with this name in the 15th <abbr>cent.</abbr> (Schmidt, 43). Its main
                        church, however, in all likelihood goes back to the 11th <abbr>cent.</abbr> After it had
                        fallen into ruins, in the 18th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, it was neglected for more than two
                        centuries; several of its wall paintings were transferred to the National
                        Museum of Damascus and to the museum of nearby Dayr ʿAtiya. It was only in
                        the 1990s that, under the leadership of Sœur Agnès-Maria de la Croix, the
                        monastery with its church was rebuilt and became the home of a community of
                        female ascetics, belonging to the jurisdiction of the Melkite-Catholic <abbr>bp.</abbr>
                        of Ḥimṣ, Ḥama, Yabrud, and Qara. Within the framework of this rebuilding and
                        restoration project several of the paintings were returned to the monastery.
                        Together with the newly discovered paintings, they were studied in a
                        monograph by Schmidt and Westphalen (2005).</p>
                    <p>The church of the monastery has a remarkable structure in that it consists of
                        an upper and lower church, sharing the same apse construction. Accordingly,
                        there are two parallel levels of decoration which, moreover, each were
                        decorated twice, first in the 11th  cent. and again in the 13th <abbr>cent.</abbr>
                        (before 1266). The various iconographic programs can be reconstructed only
                        very imperfectly. Among the earliest paintings, there is a row of enthroned
                        apostles (upper apse) and scenes from the life of Christ (nave of the lower
                        church, probably by a different artist). As for the 13th-cent. layer, there
                        are remnants of a large Deisis composition in the lower apse. In addition,
                        both apses have a row of images of bps. or church fathers. Although heavily
                        damaged, a few still show inscriptions with their names written in Greek and
                        Syriac (Esṭrangela, running from top to bottom). Independent from the
                        paintings, and written on the first layer of plaster, are two carefully
                        written prayers, one in Syriac (Schmidt, 151–2) and one in Greek.</p>
                    <p>In addition to their significance for art-historical studies and as a witness
                        of the ongoing presence of Christian culture in the Qalamun mountains, the
                        paintings and inscriptions in Qara provide precious information on the use
                        of Syriac among the Melkites.</p>
