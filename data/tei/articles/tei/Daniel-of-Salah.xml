                    <p>Biblical exegete, theologian, abbot and possibly <abbr>bp.</abbr> Although he is one of
                        the most influential <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> writers, none of Daniel’s writings have been
                        fully edited, and the little that is known about his life is almost entirely
                        dependent upon these texts. In a homily (on Ps. 83) in the middle of his
                        best known work, and the only one at present thought to have been preserved
                        in its entirety, his ‘Great Commentary on the Psalms’, he gives the current
                        date as year of the Greeks 853, <choice>
                            <sic>i.e. </sic>
                            <corr>i.e., </corr>
                        </choice>AD 542. Since J. S. Assemani
                        erroneously identified him with a Daniel known to have corresponded with
                            <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yaqub-of-Edessa">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/113">Yaʿqub of Edessa</persName>
                        </ref> in the 8th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, it should be emphasised that a
                        6th-cent. date is confirmed by Daniel’s theological concerns, his references
                        to contemporary historical events (such as the incursions and raids of the
                        Blemmyes, Sabirai, and Antai), and by the prefixed correspondence in which
                        Daniel is requested to write the commentary by Abbot Yuḥanon of the
                        monastery of Mor Eusebios of Kaprā d-Bartā (or d-Birtā) northwest of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Apamea">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/11">Apamea</placeName>
                        </ref>
                        (the modern twin villages of Kefr and Bara). Abbot Yuḥanon is listed in the
                        Chronicle of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Michael-I-Rabo">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/217">Michael Rabo</persName>
                        </ref> (IX.14) amongst those
                        condemned for their opposition to Chalcedon by the emperor Justinian. It
                        appears to be the same Yuḥanon (described as ‘a wall against wolves’) for
                        whom a copy of the Acts of the Second Council of Ephesus was produced by one
                        of his monks in 535 (<abbr>ms.</abbr> London, Brit. Libr. Add. 14,530). By 567, however,
                        Yuḥanon had disappeared from the scene, for one Qustantinos is listed as
                        abbot of this important monastery.</p>
                    <p>Assemani also linked Daniel with the village of Ṣalaḥ in <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Tur-Abdin">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/221">Ṭur ʿAbdin</placeName>
                        </ref>
                        (southeast Turkey), and this has been followed by all subsequent western
                        scholars. In the present <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> monastery of Ṣalaḥ, however, this
                        prestigious connection is rejected, as also by the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> scholar and
                        <abbr>Patr.</abbr> Ignatius Afram Barsoum who instead links Daniel to Ṣaliḥiye (near
                        modern Abū Kāmāl in Syria) on the left bank of the Euphrates just south of
                        ancient <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Dura-Europos">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/77">Dura-Europos</placeName>
                        </ref>. Some support for this can be found in the Chronicle
                        of Michael who describes him as Abbot Daniel of Bayt Ṣaliḥe (IX.34),
                        although the exact name and location of his monastery is not given. Later
                        tradition also links Daniel with Tella d-Mawzelat (ancient Constantina,
                        modern Viranşehir south-west of Diyarbakır, Turkey), although in some
                        sources he is said to have been born there and in others to have become its
                        bishop, as a successor to the famous <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yuhanon-of-Tella">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/50">Yuḥanon of
                            Tella</persName>
                        </ref> (d. 538). Although Daniel was certainly a leading figure in
                        the anti-Chalcedonian party he is not listed amongst those bps. ordained by
                            <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yaqub-Burdoyo">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/69">Yaʿqub Burdʿoyo</persName>
                        </ref>, and neither has any later reference to his
                        episcopacy yet been found in any source other than the <abbr>mss.</abbr> of his Psalm
                        Commentary.</p>
                    <p>Daniel’s Psalm Commentary is a vast work of erudition and spirituality, and
                        appears to be the oldest known psalm commentary composed in Syriac. It runs
                        to more than 1,000 <abbr>ms.</abbr> pages and is divided into three volumes each
                        containing fifty psalms. Although it was long thought by western scholars to
                        have been only partially preserved, it has in fact continued to be read and
                        studied in the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> church to the present day, and so their complete
                        <abbr>mss.</abbr> now make a critical edition of this important work possible.</p>
                    <p>The commentary acts as a great storehouse of <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> exegetical traditions
                        and theology and preserves both ideas known from earlier Syrian writers such
                        as <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Ephrem">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/13">Ephrem</persName>
                        </ref> and <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Aphrahat">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/10">Aphrahaṭ</persName>
                        </ref>, but also
                        many others previously unknown. It does not appear to be dependent on any
                        previous commentary, although there is evidence that Daniel knew Greek and
                        even had some access to Hebrew texts and traditions. As with Ephrem’s
                        commentary on the <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Diatessaron">Diatessaron</ref> no
                        attempt is made to expound every line or word of the Psalms, but only those
                        which attract the author’s attention. The exegesis is also structured in the
                        form of self-contained homilies, which makes them suitable for either
                        private or communal reading — in contrast, for example, with the technical,
                        philological commentary of <ref rend="bold"
                       target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Bar-Ebroyo-Grigorios">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/239">Bar ʿEbroyo</persName>
                        </ref>. Although
                        Daniel often attempts to identify the historical occasions of the Psalms’
                        composition, he usually moves quickly on to expound their spirit-inspired
                        references to the divine dispensation personified in Emmanuel, God the Word.

                        within both Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian parties. He clearly developed
                        a reputation for expertise in this area since his letter to the monks of the
                        monastery of Mar Bassus on the subject formed the basis of the official Syr.

                        commentary of ‘Daniel (or David) of Tella’, and which also includes some
