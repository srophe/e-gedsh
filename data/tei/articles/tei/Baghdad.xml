                        ‘Baghdad’, whose etymology is disputed, was originally the name of one of
                        the villages that stood on the site of the city founded by the second
                        Abbasid caliph al-Manṣūr under the name of Madīnat al-Salām ‘City of Peace’
                        in 762. Later Syriac authors often call the city ‘Babel’, <choice>

                        762 until 1258, when it was taken by Hulagu (except in 836–92, when the
                        caliphs resided in Sāmarrāʾ), Baghdad was the seat of the Abbasid caliphate,
                        and in the first half of that period was among the most prosperous and
                        culturally advanced cities in the world. Capital of a province corresponding
                        largely to the central part of today’s Iraq under the Ottomans (1534–1623,

                        persecutions as occurred earlier under the Sasanians, the Christians in
                        Baghdad were subject to certain discriminations and were vulnerable to

                        (also called Dayr al-Jāthalīq ‘Monastery of the Catholicos’) to the south of
                        the ‘Round City’, where most of the Catholicoi from Timotheos I to Sargis I
                        (860–72) were buried, and in the Monastery of Mar Petion (Dayr al-ʿAtīqa) in
                        the former village of Sūrāyā (al-ʿAtīqa) to the east of the Round City,
                        which predated the foundation of Madīnat al-Salām and was restored by
                        Sabrishoʿ II (831–35). Yoḥannan II (884–91) was the first Catholicos to
                        establish his residence on the left bank, in the Shammāsiyya Quarter in the
                        northern part of the walled city of that period. Most of the Catholicoi from
                        Yoḥannan III (893– 899) to Eliya II (1111–32) resided there and were buried
                        in the ‘Palace of the Greeks’ (Dār al-Rūm). Barṣawma  I (1134–36) moved his
                        residence south to the Church of Mar Sabrishoʿ in Sūq al-Thalātha, and
                        Yahbalaha II (1190–1222) to the Church of St. Mary in the Karkh Quarter on
                        the west bank. After the fall of Baghdad to the initially pro-Christian
                        Mongols, Makkika  II (1257–65) was given a group of buildings centered
                        around the mansion of a former vizier on the Tigris as his residence, but
