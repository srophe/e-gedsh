                        until the late 5th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, acknowledged the ecclesiastical position of the

                        relation with the <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr> was in ascendancy, the recognition of the

                        the fragmented evidence concerning the pre-Portuguese period is insufficient
                        to establish the doctrinal confession of the Malankara Church as that of the

                        non-Chalcedonian Patriarchates of Alexandria and Antioch. However, it
                        concedes continuous relations with the <abbr>Ch. of E.</abbr> between the 14th and 16th

                        gravitated to the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> Patriarchate of Antioch by 1665, and this
                        relationship was then nurtured by bishops who were delegated from

                    <p>The first head of the Church, after it asserted a <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> identity, was
                        Archdeacon Parambil Thomas (1637–70), the chief protagonist of the ‘Coonan
                        Kurishu Satyam’ of 1653 (Oath at the Leaning Cross, Mattanchery); shortly
                        thereafter, he assumed episcopal dignity with the name Mar Thoma I and was
                        subsequently consecrated canonically by the first <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> delegate, Mor
                        Gregorios ʿAbdel al-Jaleel, who arrived in 1665. He was succeeded by eight
                        indigenous metropolitans who assumed the same titular name, ending with
                        Thomas  IX (d. 1817). In the interim, Mar Thoma VI, fearing the invalidity
                        of his first consecration by the hands of his predecessor, was
                        re-consecrated as Mar Dionysius I in 1770 by Mor Gregorios Yuḥanon,
                        Patriarchal delegate, but his successor resumed the line as Mar Thoma  VII.
                        The Dionysios line was resumed in 1815 with the consecration of Dionysios II
                        as a rival to the Thomas line. Mar Athanasios Mathews was the first to be
                        consecrated by a <abbr>patr.</abbr>, in 1843 at <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Mardin">

                        followed by other Malankara Metropolitans, prominent among whom are
                        Dionysios VI (excommunicated in 1911), Mar Kurillos Paulose, and Mar

                    <p>The Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church has today 17 dioceses and more than 600
                        churches in India and several educational and medical institutions as well
                        as social service organizations. Nearly 80 parishes have been established in
                        North America, Europe, the Persian Gulf, Singapore, Australia, and New
                        Zealand. A few of the churches in India are also claimed by the
                        autocephalous Malankara Orthodox Church and are often uneasily shared under
                        court direction or are closed for worship. Since 2002, the Catholicate is at

                        30 churches. The major monasteries of the Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church
                        at Manjinikkara, Piramadom, and Malekurishu fall under this Vicariate. The

                        TV sites.</p>
                    <p>The Church curiously retains ‘Jacobite’ in its name, even though the Syr.
                        Orth. Church rejects this appellation as pejorative. Thomas Christians were
                        known as ‘Nazranis’ in the era prior to European influence. The Christians
                        who asserted a <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> identity in the 17th  cent. were called the
                        ‘Puthenkoor’ (‘New Allegiance’), but this gave way to the term ‘Jacobite’
                        under European influence. The term appears to have been adopted without
                        recognizing its negative connotations elsewhere; its continued formal usage
                        results from the distinct historical identity it confers and is encouraged
                        by a popular misconception that it is the antique name of the Church.</p>
                    <p>Historically, the liturgical language of the Thomas Christians is Syriac.
                        <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> liturgies were adopted from Mesopotamia over a long period of
                        time and liturgical practices evolved, progressively conforming to Syr.
                        Orth. traditions, but with notable local adaptations. Malayalam translations
                        of the <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Peshitta">Peshitta</ref> Gospels were first printed in 1811. The first ever print
                        of the Syriac <hi rend="italic">Šḥimo</hi> (Simple Prayer) in linotype was
                        published in 1861. The late 19th/early 20th <abbr>cent.</abbr> saw the advent of the
                        Syriac <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Printing">printing</ref> press and the publication of several
                        liturgical texts in Syriac and Malayalam by V. Rev. Malpan <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Konat-Matta">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/303">Matta Konat</persName>
                        </ref> at
                        Mar Julius Press, Pampakuda; these editions became the authorized versions,
                        de facto. The Reformist movement in the 19th <abbr>cent.</abbr> prompted worship services
                        in the vernacular Malayalam, although it was only in the early 20th <abbr>cent.</abbr>
                        that manuscripts and prints of translations came into vogue. Today,
                        liturgical services are conducted predominantly in Malayalam, although with
                        some remnants of Syriac, primarily in liturgical formulas. Most clergymen
                        today have, at best, a rudimentary knowledge of Syriac. The musical system
                        based on the Beth Gazo has been influenced by various <hi rend="italic">malphone</hi> from Mesopotamia, most recently, Mor Yulios Elias Qoro
                        and Rabban ʿAbd al-Aḥad (later <abbr>Patr.</abbr> Yaʿqub III); thus the fusion of
                        different Middle Eastern schools of music with local adaptations resulted in
                        a unique musical tradition. However, since the 1970s, secular music
                        influenced by the indigenous Carnatic as well as Western genres has altered
                        liturgical music indiscriminately and, today, the octoechos is known only to
                        the connoisseur. The Malankara <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> influence on <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> churches
                        across the world is most visible in the liturgical vestments and clothes
                        produced in Kerala, with a distinct style.</p>
