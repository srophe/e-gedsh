                        Armenian Catholic, Latin). Aleppo, nicknamed ‘Grey Aleppo’ (<hi rend="italic">Ḥalab al-šahbāʾ</hi>) in Arabic, owes its military and
                        commercial importance to its imposing citadel and its favorable position on
                        the trade route linking the nearby Mediterranean coast with Mesopotamia and
                        areas beyond. Aleppo’s history goes back at least to the second millenium
                        BC. The earliest known names of Aleppo are cognates of the modern name
                        ‘Ḥalab’, but Seleucus Nicator (d.  281  BC) who founded a Greek colony here
                        named it after ‘Beroea’ in Macedonia, and it is by that name that Aleppo is
                        normally known in older Syriac literature. Aleppo came under Roman rule in
                        64 BC. After the Arab conquest in 636, Aleppo first rose to prominence under
                        the Ḥamdānid Sayf al-Dawla (945–67). Aleppo later became the seat of lines
                        of Zangids (1129–83) and Ayyūbids (1183–1260). Aleppo was taken by the
                        Mongols in 1260 and a little later by the Mamlukes. Under the Ottomans
                        (1516–1918), Aleppo became the capital of a province covering much of
                        today’s northern Syria and a significant part of Turkey (including <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Antioch">

                        </ref>, Alexandretta/Iskenderun, and ʿAintab/Gaziantep). For much of
                        that period, it was the third largest city in the Ottoman Empire after
                        Istanbul and Cairo, and the Christians, including Syr. Christians, as well
                        as a larger number of Melkites and later an increasing number of Armenians,
                        then played an important role in the life of the city, one noteworthy member
                        of the Aleppine Syr. Catholic community from the period being the

                        Church is reflected in the fact that five out of the thirteen successors of

                    <p>The presence of an early Maronite community in Aleppo in 727 is recorded in

                        </ref>. Significant presence
                        of Maronites in the modern period dates from the 17th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, with Maronite
                        bishops regularly resident in the city since 1686. Aleppo played an
                        important role in the life of the Maronite Church as one of her few urban
                        centers, and the Maronite school there produced such men as the three
                        founders of the Maronite Aleppine Order (later Mariamites) and the
                        scholar-bishop Germanus Farḥāt (<abbr>bp.</abbr> of Aleppo 1725–32). The Maronite woman
                        mystic Hindiyya al-ʿUjaymī was born in Aleppo in 1720.</p>
                    <p>In the first decade of the 20th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, there were reported to be
                        approximately 35,000–40,000 Christians in the city, making up about one
                        third of the total population and including: 3,500 Syr. Catholics (4,000 in
                        the diocese), 50 <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> (500 in the diocese), 250 <abbr>Chald.</abbr> and 3,600
                        <abbr>Maron.</abbr> (Karalevsky); as well as 1,200 <abbr>Melk.</abbr> Orth., 10,000 <abbr>Melk.</abbr> Catholics,
                        15,000 Armenian Orth., 5,500–7,000 Armenian Catholics, 1,100 Latins and
                        1,500 Protestants (Tournebize). The numbers reported today for the Syriac
                        dioceses of Aleppo are: <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> 15,000 (in 2003, Zinda Magazine); Syr.
                        Catholic 8,000 (in 2006, <hi rend="italic">Annuario pontificio</hi>); <abbr>Chald.</abbr>
                        15,000 (in 2006, <hi rend="italic">Annuario pontificio</hi>, for whole of
                        Syria); <abbr>Maron.</abbr> 4,000 (in 2006, <hi rend="italic">Annuario pontificio</hi>).
                        The actual numbers (esp. for the Chaldeans) will have been increased
                        significantly by those fleeing insecurity in Iraq since 2003.</p>
                    <p>Little is known about the sites of the medieval Syriac churches in Aleppo.
                        The churches dating from the Ottoman period are found in the traditional
                        Christian quarter in Judayda just north of the medieval city. These include
                        the Melkite and Armenian churches concentrated in the Ṣalībat al-Judayda
                        Quarter, as well as the Syr. Catholic Church of Mār Āsyā al-Ḥakīm (formerly
                        Mother of God) a little to the east, and the Maronite Cathedral of Mar Eliya
                        to the north. A  number of newer churches, including the Syr. Catholic
                        Cathedral (Umm al-Intiqāl/Assumption, 1970), are found in the ʿAzīziyya
                        District to the north of Judayda. The Chaldean Cathedral and the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>
                        Cathedral of Mar Ephrem lie further north in Sulaymāniyya. Further churches
                        belonging to the Syriac communities are found in the ‘Old Syriac Quarter’
                        (Ḥayy al-Suryān al-Qadīm) just behind the railway station to the northwest
                        of the city center, a quarter established by migrants from Edessa (Mār
                        Jirjis, <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>; Mār Afrām, Syr. Catholic), and in the ‘New Syriac
                        Quarter’ (Ḥayy al-Suryān al-Jadīd) further northwest (Sayyidat al-Suryān
                        ‘Our Lady of the Syriacs’, <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>).</p>
                    <p>Important collections of Christian Arabic and Syriac <abbr>mss.</abbr> are found in Aleppo
