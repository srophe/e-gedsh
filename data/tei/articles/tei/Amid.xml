                    <p>City in upper Mesopotamia. Situated on high ground on the right bank of the
                        Tigris and surrounded by massive black basalt walls, which later gave it the
                        nickname ‘Black (<hi rend="italic">kara</hi>) Amid’, Amid was by the 4th
                        <abbr>cent.</abbr> a key point in Rome’s defence of her eastern frontiers and became the
                        most important city in the Roman province of Mesopotamia after the cession
                        of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Nisibis">

                        </ref> to the Persians in 363. It was taken by the Persians in
                        359, 503, and 606/7. After the Arab conquest in 639, it was ruled by a
                        series of dynasties including the Kurdish Marwānids (984–1085), and the
                        Turkmen Īnālids (1097–1183), Ḥisn Kayfā Artuqids (1183–1230) and Aq Qoyunlu
                        (1401–1507), dynasties which at one point or another made Amid their chief
                        seat. After being taken by the Ottomans in 1515, Amid became the
                        administrative center of a province that covered most of northern
                        Mesopotamia from Manzikert in the north to Sinjar in the south. It is today
                        a provincial capital and the largest city in the Turkish part of Mesopotamia
                        with a population of over half a million. The name Diyarbakır (Arabic <hi rend="italic">Diyār Bakr</hi>), which originally referred to the region
                        around Amid, came to be used for the city in Ottoman times and was
                        officially adopted in 1937, replacing the older name which goes back to
                        Assyrian ‘Amedi’.</p>
                    <p>Amid was evangelised at an early date, no doubt from <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Edessa">

                        </ref>. The first
                        known <abbr>bp.</abbr> of Amid, Simeon, is said in a late source to have attended the
                        Council of Nicaea. His successors include Acacius,
                        celebrated for his ransoming of Roman soldiers taken captive by the Persians
                        in 423/4, as well as Asterios and Shemʿon, the only bishops from the
                        province of Mesopotamia to attend the councils, respectively, of Ephesus and
                        Chalcedon. The area around Amid was an important center of monasticism with
                        five monasteries within the city by 525 (<ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Zacharias-Pseudo-">Pseudo-Zacharias</ref>, Ecclesiastical History, VIII.5). Well-known
                        monasteries in the immediate vicinity include those of 1. the Edessenes (4th
                        <abbr>cent.</abbr>, probably on a site just south of the city wall); 2. Yoḥannan Urṭaya
                        (4th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, north of the city wall), where <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yuhanon-of-Ephesus">

                        southwest of Amid (attested 11th–19th <abbr>cent.</abbr>).</p>
                    <p>In the period after the Council of Chalcedon, Amid was a Miaphysite
                        stronghold, and <abbr>Bp.</abbr> Mara of Amid was one of those bps. expelled from their
                        sees under Emperor Justin I. After a period of persecution for the
                        Miaphysites under the Chalcedonian <abbr>Bp.</abbr> Abraham bar Kaili, a line of
                        Miaphysite bishops was reestablished with the consecration of Eunomius in
                        <abbr>ca.</abbr> 546. Among the later occupants of the see was <ref rend="bold"

                        several occasions, including a period in the 11th <abbr>cent.</abbr> after Dionysios IV
                        (1032–42) took refuge in the then Marwānid city to escape persecution in

                        </ref> (1521– 1557), and in 1862–71 when
                        Ignatius Yaʿqub II (1847–1871) took up residence in the Yoldat Aloho Church

                        Aslan in 1933.</p>
                    <p>The presence of E.-Syr. Christians in Amid is suggested by the inclusion of
                        ‘Amid’ in the titles of bishops of Maypherqaṭ from the 12th <abbr>cent.</abbr> onwards.
                        The first <abbr>Chald.</abbr> patriarch, <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yohannan-Sullaqa">

                        </ref>, resided in Amid after his return from Rome in 1553.
                        Later, Amid became the residence of a new line of <abbr>Chald.</abbr> patriarchs from
                        Yawsep I (1681–96) to Yawsep V (Augustin Hindi, 1781–1828). The <abbr>Chald.</abbr> see
                        of Diyarbakır, vacant after 1923, was revived in name in 1966, with
                        residence, however, in Istanbul and jurisdiction over the whole of Turkey

                    <p>Syriac Christians originally constituted the majority of the Christian

                        The Melkite community, which had been Syriac-speaking in pre-Islamic times,
                        dwindled after the Arab conquest, but was reinforced by migrants from <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Aleppo">

                        in the 17th <abbr>cent.</abbr> According to a census conducted in 1870, the city had a
                        population of 21,372, with 9,814 Muslims, 6,853 Armenian Orth., 831 Armenian

                        Orth., 55 <abbr>Melk.</abbr> Catholics, 650 Protestants and 280 Jews. In 1908, <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Faiq-Naum">

                        the city is reported to have stood at 8,000, and that of the thirty or so
                        nearby villages (including Kaʿbiya, Sharukhiya, Qarabash, Quṭurbul, ʿAyn
                        Tannūr/Ali Pınar) at 6,450. Though greatly diminished by the massacres
                        during the First World War, a sizeable Christian community remained until
                        relatively recently, with the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> community still numbering nearly

                        residences, remain in regular use: 1. Yoldat Aloho (<abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>, in Lāle Bey
                        Quarter, in the southwest section of the old city, 3rd/6th <abbr>cent.</abbr>?), with the
                        main church of Yoldat Aloho and that of Mor Yaʿqub adjoining it to the north
                        and housing the relics of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yaqub-of-Serugh">

                        crossroads). (An Evangelical church opened opposite Yoldat Aloho in 2003).
                        Still in situ are: St. George’s (in the citadel, 4th <abbr>cent.</abbr>?), Latin
                        (Capuchin, in northeast section of old city, 17th <abbr>cent.</abbr>), Protestant
                        (southeast) and Armenian Catholic (southeast) churches, as well as the
                        Armenian Orth. churches of Surp Giragos (adjoining Mar Petion to the east,
                        16th <abbr>cent.</abbr>) and Surp Sarkis (southwest, 16th <abbr>cent.</abbr>) and chapel of Surp
                        Hagop. Two churches were demolished in the 20th <abbr>cent.</abbr>: 1. Cosmas and Damian
                        (east of Yoldat Aloho, 4th <abbr>cent.</abbr>?, <abbr>Melk.</abbr> in modern period); 2. the Syr.
                        <abbr>Cath.</abbr> Church (northeast, 7th <abbr>cent.</abbr>?). Among the churches mentioned in
                        historical records, the one built by Emperor Heraclius in 628/9 was probably
                        a <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> Church, which is to be distinguished from the <abbr>Melk.</abbr> church
                        (called St. Thomas?) occupying the site of the present Great Mosque (see
                        Palmer). Other known churches (some of them possibly identical with those
                        already mentioned) include: St. John the Baptist (place of burial, in
                        649/50, of <abbr>Bp.</abbr> Yuḥanon of the Arabs), St. Stephen (converted to fire temple
                        in 503), Mor Zʿuro (near Urfa Gate, before 503; burial place, in 649/50, of

                        of Qarṭmin (<abbr>bp.</abbr> of Amid 483/4–502), who was responsible also for the
