                        community to break free of Jesuit control in 1653 at the Coonan Cross
                        incident. Subsequently, as a result of the successful efforts of Carmelite
                        missionaries, the majority of St. Thomas Christians returned to Roman
                        obedience (see <ref rend="bold"
                       target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Malabar-Catholic-Church">Malabar
                            Catholic Church</ref>). The remaining section (called <hi rend="italic">Puthenkuttukar</hi> or New Party to distinguish them from the
                        Romo-Syrians who were <hi rend="italic">Pazhayakuttukar</hi> or Old Party),
                        continued to use latinized E.-Syr. rites, but began to come under the
                        influence of periodic visitors of the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> tradition.</p>
                    <p>A definitive step took place in 1751 when the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> Mafryono Basilios
                        Shakrallah arrived in Kerala, accompanied by Mar Gregorios of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Jerusalem">
                            <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/104">Jerusalem</placeName>
                        </ref> and another companion, whom the Mafryono soon
                        consecrated with the title ‘Mar Ivanios, <abbr>bp.</abbr> of India’. The party seems to
                        represent a more systematic attempt to introduce W.-Syr. usage than had been
                        the case with earlier visitors. The delegation was also authorised by the

                        community, Mar Thoma V, with the expectation that he would minister under
                        the jurisdiction of the Mafryono and his companions. Squabbles about money
                        and jurisdiction prevented this intended outcome, and Mar Thoma V died in
                        about 1765, without having been re-consecrated, but having himself
                        consecrated his nephew as Mar Thoma VI.</p>
                    <p>The Mafryono gathered a small household, among whom he disseminated Syr.
                        Orth. usage. Immediately prior to his death in 1764, he consecrated a native
                        priest of the Kattumangat family as <abbr>bp.</abbr>, giving him the title of Mar
                        Koorilose. For several years the new <abbr>bp.</abbr> lived quietly in a monastic
                        community at Thevanal. In 1770 Mar Gregorios and Mar Ivanios consecrated Mar
                        Thoma VI as Mar Dionysios I. Mar Gregorios seems to have very soon regretted
                        this action and in 1772 raised Mar Koorilose to the rank of Metropolitan.
                        Mar Koorilose also received a ring from the Rajah of Cochin, the traditional
                        acknowledgement of the head of the St. Thomas Christians. Mar Dionysios
                        managed to imprison his rival, who eventually escaped and fled to the
                        village of Anjur in the territory of the Zamorin of Calicut, later British
                        Malabar. A gift of land from a prominent Muslim, whose son Mar Koorilose had
                        healed, enabled a Cathedral Church to be built at nearby Thozhiyur.</p>
                    <p>Following the failure of validly consecrated bishops among Mar Dionysios I’s
                        successors in the early 19th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, recourse was had to a successor of Mar
                        Koorilose at Thozhiyur, Mar Philoxenos II, who consecrated three bishops <choice>

                    <p>In 1894 the two Thozhiyur bishops (Mar Athanasios I and Mar Koorilose V)
                        consecrated a Metropolitan for that section of the Puthenkuttukar which
                        repudiated Patriarchal authority and desired a degree of reform (see <ref rend="bold"
                       target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Mar-Thoma-Syrian-Church-Malankara">Mar Thoma Syrian Church</ref>).</p>
                    <p>The community has always been <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> in rite. It has about 15 churches
                        and priests, and several schools. The Church is active in ecumenical
                        activities in Kerala and outside India. In 1998 and 2008 the Metropolitans
                        were Ecumenical Observers at the Lambeth Conference of Anglican bishops. In
                        2006 both current bishops (Mar Koorilose IX and Mar Basilios I) participated
                        in the consecration of bishops for the Free Church of England.</p>
                    <p>A Constitution was drawn up in 1947, appointing a Sabha Mandalam,
                        representing all the churches, for special business such as electing a <abbr>bp.</abbr>,
                        and Council of Clergy and Laity to assist the Metropolitan in governing the
                        Church.</p>
                    <p>Since the 1970s worship has been celebrated mainly in Malayalam, though
                        Syriac is still used for the Daily Offices and midweek Qurbanas at Thozhiyur
