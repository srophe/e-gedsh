                    <p>Name given by modern scholars to an 8th/9th-cent. compilation in W.-Syr. as
                        well as in E.-Syr. tradition, containing various philological and
                        grammatical materials to serve as a tool for the standardization of
                        orthography and pronunciation of the Syriac language. The major part
                        consists of sample texts drawn from the <abbr>OT</abbr>, the <abbr>NT</abbr>, and patristic texts in
                        order to illustrate the correct use of the language in writing and
                        reading.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">1. Name</label>
                    <p>The term ‘Masora’ (‘tradition’) was adopted from the well-known Hebrew
                        Masora, which fixed the orthography and pronunciation of the Hebrew Bible
                        (‘Masoretic text’). However, in contrast to the Hebrew Masora, the character
                        of the Syr. ‘masoretic’ compilations is not normative but regulative: Based
                        on sample texts they standardize the orthographic representation of the
                        pronunciation; they are not fixing the text itself by introducing an
                        exclusive orthography. In the Syriac <abbr>mss.</abbr>, the title of the compilation (at
                        least of its first and largest part) is: ‘Booklet of (vocalized) words and
                        readings of the <abbr>OT</abbr> and the <abbr>NT</abbr> according to the tradition of Qarqaphto’ (<hi rend="italic">Kurroso da-šmohe w-da-qroyotho d-ʿattiqto w-da-ḥdatto
                            ʾa(y)k mašlmonutho qarqphoyto</hi>, <abbr>ms.</abbr> Vat. Syr. 152), or shorter:
                        ‘Booklet of (vocalized) words of the Holy Scriptures’ (<hi rend="italic">Kurroso da-šmohe da-ktobhe qaddiše</hi>, <abbr>ms.</abbr> Brit. Libr. Add. 12,178).
                        According to the longer title the compilation originated from the <ref rend="bold"
                       target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Qarqaphto-Monastery-of">

                        </ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Mašlmonutho Qarqphoyto</hi> would, therefore, be the
                        appropriate Syriac title. This Syriac title, however, did not succeed in
                        replacing the convenient modern term ‘Masora’ and its derivation
                        ‘Masoretic’, both of which should be used with quotation marks.</p>
                    <label type="subsection">2. Historical Background</label>
                    <p>The historical background of the ‘Masora’ is the fading away of Syriac as the
                        colloquial language of Syr. Christians after the rise of Islam. This
                        situation stimulated grammar and lexicography among the Syrians to
                        consolidate the native language and cultural heritage in order to preserve
                        the Syr. Christian identity. Some of the materials compiled in the ‘Masora’
                        can be traced back to the 7th <abbr>cent.</abbr> and derive from <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Yaqub-of-Edessa">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/113">Yaʿqub of

                        grammar and orthography among the W. Syrians. He might be the initiator or
                        instigator of the ‘Masora’, which started to flourish immediately after his
                        death.</p>

                        history of the compilation. The original Western ‛Masora’ may be dated to

                        development derives from the Qarqphoye monks is not clear. However, the
                        materials compiled in the ‘Masora’ are of homogeneous character in that they
                        reflect the main authorities of Miaphysite theology and philology (biblical
                        and patristic texts, Yaʿqub of Edessa) and deal with orthography and
                        pronunciation of Syriac.</p>

                        patristic sections of the ‘Masoretic’ <abbr>mss.</abbr> clearly demonstrate the
                        non-normative (but regulative) character of the ‘Masoretic’ standardisation
                        (although patristic writings are scarcely attested in post-‘Masoretic’
                        <abbr>mss.</abbr>). It is quite obvious that the standard does not refer to the spelling
                        of Greek proper nouns and theological terms (which is not uniform in the
                        ‘Masoretic’ <abbr>mss.</abbr> themselves) but to their proper phonetical representation
                        (which may vary within the standard of grecization). In addition to that,
                        the patristic sections of the ‘Masora’ provide unique insights into
                        linguistic and lexical studies by Syrian scholars and scribes, as well as
                        into an important branch of the educational system of the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>

                        extensive than its W.-Syr. counterpart as it is of almost exclusive biblical

                        annotated in the margins. There are five sections: the first deals with the

                        signs to Syriac. This innovative ‘Masoretic’ feature follows (but
                        simplifies) the model of Yaʿqub of Edessa, who invented seven vowel <hi rend="italic">letters</hi> for grammatical demonstration (see Segal, <hi rend="italic">Diacritical point</hi>, 40–7). The five ‘Greek’ vowel
                        signs were not intended to be fully applied to Syriac texts but restricted
                        to ‘grammatical’ specification of difficult or ambiguous words. Fully
                        vocalized <abbr>mss.</abbr> do not antedate the 16th <abbr>cent.</abbr> and take into consideration
                        the reader’s ignorance of the traditional pronunciation. The witnesses of
                        the ‘Syriac Masora’ are the earliest <abbr>mss.</abbr> with vowel signs attached to the

                    <label type="subsection">8. ‘Pre-Masoretic’ and ‘Masoretic’</label>
                    <p>Although the ‘Masoretic’ system of vocalisation was not designed to replace
                        the use of the ‘pre-Masoretic’ diacritical point, which served to
                        distinguish grammatical persons and tenses, the imperfection of the
                        traditional system called for further specification. The ‘Masoretic’
                        innovation was the adoption of the diacritical point and its explicit
                        redefinition by vowel signs and <hi rend="italic">quššoyo/rukkokho</hi>. The
                        coexistence of the old and new system of grammatical distinction is
                        evidenced in the ‘Masoretic’ <abbr>mss.</abbr> themselves (esp. in <abbr>ms.</abbr> Vat. Syr. 152 and
                        <abbr>ms.</abbr> Barberini orient. 118): <hi rend="italic">quššoyo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rukkokho</hi> are marked with large red dots to
                        distinguish them from the smaller black diacritical point. This explicit
                        redefinition allowed the traditional diacritical point to maintain its
                        position in the Syriac literature; by its redefinition the diacritical point
                        introduced the new ‘Masoretic’ standard to the ‘pre-Masoretic’ Syriac
                        literature.</p>

                    <p>It was P. Martin who in his ‘Tradition karkaphienne’ (1869) identified the
                        ‘Masoretic’ character of the compilation. Parts of the E.-Syr. ‘Masora’ were
                        published in 1933 by Th. Weiss. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of
                        the W.-Syr. ‘Masora’ no (critical) edition has been undertaken so far. For
                        editors of the Syriac <abbr>OT</abbr> and <abbr>NT</abbr>, the ‘Masoretic’ <abbr>mss.</abbr> seem to be of no great
                        critical value on account of their abridged and selective way of quotation.
                        Nevertheless, ‘Masoretic’ <abbr>mss.</abbr> have been extensively used in research on the
                        <abbr>OT</abbr> Peshitta. Although excluded from the ‘Leiden Edition’ of the <abbr>OT</abbr>, the
                        ‘Masora’ contributed to the research on the <abbr>ms.</abbr> tradition of single <abbr>OT</abbr> books
                        (P. B. Dirksen, on Judges [1972]; M. Koster, on Exodus [1977]; and A.
                        Gelston, on Twelve Prophets [1987]). The Peshitta Gospel edition prepared by
                        Ph. E. Pusey and G. H. Gwilliam (1901) includes the E.-Syr. ‘Masora’ as well
                        as three <abbr>mss.</abbr> of the W.-Syr. ‘Masora’ (<abbr>mss.</abbr> Brit. Libr. Add. 12,178; Add.
                        7183; and Add. 14,648). This Gospel edition turns the ‘Masoretic’ sample
                        texts into a complete edition by its systematic adoption of the Western
                        pronunciation. It is fully vocalized with the five ‘Greek’ vowels and
                        furnished with <hi rend="italic">quššoyo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rukkokho</hi>. However, it does not give the ‘Masoretic’ orthography of
                        the proper nouns and Greek (loan) words, but rather follows the orthography
                        of the ‘pre-Masoretic’ <abbr>mss.</abbr> A ‘Masoretic’ edition of the Peshitta Acts and
                        Epistles was published in 1920 by G. H. Gwilliam and J. Pinkerton (British
                        and Foreign Bible Society).</p>
                    <label type="subsection">Conclusion</label>
                    <p>Bringing together the fields of grammar and lexicography, the ‘Masora’ is of
                        general significance for the study of Syriac language and literature; it
                        also contributes to our understanding of the history and culture of the
                        Syrians. The ‘Masoretic’ perspective on Syriac literature allows for the
                        distinction of a ‘pre-Masoretic’ (5th–7th <abbr>cent.</abbr>) and a ‘Masoretic’
                        (8th–13th <abbr>cent.</abbr>) period, both with their own characteristic features. The
                        earlier period was the formative period of Syriac culture, open to Greek
                        influence, development and inculturation into the Greek Byzantine Oikumene;
                        it roughly coincides with the pre-Islamic history of the Syrian Churches.
                        The later period is marked by philology, standardization, and by the
                        formation of ‘national’ E.-Syr. and W.-Syr. traditions. This conservative
                        attitude towards their own heritage roughly coincides with the history of
                        the Syriac Churches under Islam. Still today reading and writing of Syriac
                        texts is directed by the ‘Syriac Masora’.</p>
