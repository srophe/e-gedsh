                    <p>The Church of the East traces its history to the earliest planting of
                        Christianity in the Persian Empire. The fact that the church developed
                        outside the Roman Empire and its conciliar process partly explains its
                        particular doctrinal tradition. It represents a third position in the
                        three-way split in Eastern Christianity that resulted from the
                        Christological controversies of the 5th/6th <abbr>cent.</abbr>, alongside the Syriac (and
                        other Oriental) Orthodox and the Chalcedonian (Melkite, Rum) Orthodox
                        Churches. The Church of the East follows the strictly dyophysite
                        (‘two-nature’) christology of <ref rend="bold"

                        as ‘Nestorian’ by its theological opponents.</p>
                    <p>Especially in the second half of the first millennium the Church expanded
                        eastwards, reaching <ref rend="bold"
                       target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/China-Syriac-Christianity-in">China</ref> and south India (where the

                        the East became greatly diminished on account of plague, oppression, and
                        periodic massacres. In the mid 16th <abbr>cent.</abbr> a separate patriarchal line
                        developed, in communion with Rome (see <ref rend="bold"

                        just before, during, and in the aftermath of the First World War (see <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Sayfo">Sayfo</ref>).
                        The remnant of the Church were forced to settle in Iraq as refugees.
                        Following the killing of Assyrian civilians by the Iraqi army at Semele in
                        1933, the Catholicos Patriarch (Mar <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Shemon-Eshai">

                        expelled from Iraq.</p>
                    <p>In 1968 the Church suffered a schism, the immediate cause of which was the
                        adoption of the New Calendar mandated by Mar Shemʿon in California. The
                        government of Iraq favored the anti-Mar Shemʿon party and facilitated the
                        election of Mar <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Darmo-Toma">
                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/441">Toma Darmo</persName>

                        counter <abbr>patr.</abbr> Mar Darmo also made an issue of his opposition to the
                        hereditary succession to the patriarchate. However, Mar Shemʿon had no
                        nephews to succeed him, and in 1976, following his assassination, the new

                        </ref> IV was elected canonically. The issue of succession thus no
                        longer divides the two Church bodies, but other historical issues (of which
                        the calendar is only one) and animosities continue to do so. Both Churches
                        have now (2009) agreed to hold a joint synod to try to resolve differences
                        (in India the matter was already resolved in 1995). Both Churches have large
                        diasporas, especially in North America (see <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Diaspora">diaspora</ref>).</p>

                        church in Moscow). Since the mid 1980s the Ch. of the East has been actively
                        involved in <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Ecumenical-dialogue">Ecumenical

                        and Pope John Paul II issued a historic common statement on christology. In
                        1997 the synods of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic
                        Church agreed to take common steps to restore union between the two
                        Churches; this process, however, has encountered a number of obstacles and
                        little progress has been made so far.</p>
                    <p>2. Ancient Church of the East: The Church under Mar Toma Darmo (d. 1968) and
                        his successor Mar Addai II (1972–) adopted the name ‘Ancient Church of the
                        East’, to difference itself from the larger ‘Assyrian’ Church (and possibly
