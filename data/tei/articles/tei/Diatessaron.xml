                        under Justin Martyr. It seems that Justin was already using a Gospel
                        harmony, apparently based on the synoptic Gospels. After Justin’s death
                        (between 163 and 167), Tatian ran afoul of the Roman congregation. <ref rend="bold"

                        congregation in 172. After that we have only a report of <ref rend="bold"

                            <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/477">Epiphanius</persName>
                        </ref>, stating that he returned to the East, where he
                        founded a school. Given this history, it seems unlikely that Tatian would
                        have created the Diatessaron while Justin (with whom he seems to have had
                        good relations) was alive. Similarly, since no Greek (‘Western’) source
                        speaks of the Diatessaron prior to Eusebius (and Eusebius was an Easterner
                        in practice, and wrote in the East), it seems unlikely that the Diatessaron
                        was composed in Rome. Rather, it is more likely to have been composed on the
                        way back to the East, or in the East, shortly after 172. Evidence suggests
                        that the Diatessaron was composed in <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Syriac-Language"> Syriac</ref> (see
                        below). If correct, this too would favour composition in the East (but it
                        should not be interpreted as precluding composition in the West, for Syriac
                        was used in Rome in the 2nd <abbr>cent.</abbr>). While the use of the Diatessaron in
                        early Syriac Christianity presupposes an early date for its composition,
                        Tatian’s authorship is not explicitly mentioned in any of the early Syriac
                        sources. Not surprisingly, therefore, his authorship has been questioned in
                        recent research (Koltun-Fromm).</p>
                    <p>A Gospel harmony is a complicated creation. It seeks, by acute literary
                        skill, to conflate parallel accounts. Duplications are excised, conflicts
                        are resolved, and nothing of importance is lost. Various reasons for
                        Tatian’s efforts have been suggested; none, on its own, is convincing, and
                        the reality probably lies in a combination of motives. First, in his only
                        other surviving literary work, his ‘Oration to the Greeks’, Tatian
                        emphasizes the unity of truth. Four canonical Gospels as well as numerous
                        extra-canonical Gospels do not present a ‘unity’ which, for Tatian, was the
                        hallmark of truth. Here, then, one can discern a motive for creating a
                        single, harmonized account. Second, the contradictions and inconsistencies
                        in the Gospels had led critics such as Celsus to ridicule Christianity. One
                        way to resolve these problems was Marcion’s: to select one gospel and
                        exclude all others. But the same problem may also be solved as Tatian did:
                        create one Gospel — a harmony — out of the many. A third motive may simply
                        have been the spirit of the times. Tatian’s teacher Justin used a harmony,
                        and other harmonies circulated in the early Church. In other words, Tatian
                        may simply have been doing what others were doing. Fourth, the 2nd-cent.
                        view of the task of an historian was to sift through the sometimes
                        contradictory individual accounts of an event and then, through the exercise
                        of sound historical judgement, write the single definitive account.
                        According to this view, Tatian saw himself as an historian; the Gospels were
                        ‘raw material’ for an historian; the Diatessaron was therefore a scholarly
                        work of a ‘professional’ historian.</p>
                    <p>The Diatessaron is extremely important for recovering the oldest text of the
                        Gospels. It is obvious that Tatian, when composing his harmony, had to use
                        the Gospels in the form they had in the mid-2nd <abbr>cent.</abbr> He also, apparently,
                        availed himself of Justin’s already-extant harmony of the synoptic Gospels,
                        augmenting it with material from the Gospel of John and then recasting its
                        sequence. Therefore, the Diatessaron preserves numerous ancient deviating
                        readings — that is, readings which deviate from modern critical editions of
                        the Gospels, but which agree with other <choice>

                            <corr>2nd-</corr>
                        </choice>
                        <abbr>cent.</abbr> sources (such as the
                        Jewish-Christian Gospel fragments, the ‘Gospel of Thomas’, Justin, etc.).
                        This means that when he composed the Diatessaron, Tatian either used
                        (proto-) canonical Gospels whose text contained readings now found only in
                        the Jewish-Christian Gospels, or that, in addition to the canonical Gospels,
                        he also used extra-canonical sources, including one or more Jewish-Christian
                        Gospels.</p>
                    <p>Today no direct copies of the Diatessaron survive. Its text must be
                        reconstructed through a painstaking collation and comparison of numerous
                        ‘witnesses’ to the Diatessaron: an assortment of translations (into both
                        Eastern and Western languages) and patristic quotations. These include
                        translations (sometimes heavily revised) into Arabic, Latin, Old Italian,
                        Old High German, Middle Dutch, Middle High German, Middle English, and other
                        languages. A Persian harmony also exists, but its sequence is very different
                        from that of the Diatessaron, even though in many individual variants it
                        seems to agree with the Diatessaron. It should be noted that a gospel
                        harmony has two distinctive features which can be used for identification:
                        1. the sequence of harmonization, and 2. the individual variant readings
                        within a verse.</p>
                    <p>The Diatessaron’s influence was not limited to Syria, but extended to other
                        areas, both Eastern and Western. It is thought that the Gospels first
                        appeared in Armenian in the form of a translation of the Diatessaron, and it
                        influenced the translation of the separate Gospels into Georgian. We even
                        find its distinctive readings in the Manichaean texts written in Parthian
                        and found at Turfan, in China. In the West, the oldest known translation of
                        the Gospels into Middle Dutch is a Gospel harmony (known as ‘the Liège
                        Harmony’) related to the Diatessaron; and while not the oldest Gospel
                        translation into Old High German (that honour goes to a few fragments at a
                        cloister in <choice>
                            <sic>Monsee</sic>
                            <corr>Mondsee</corr>
                        </choice>, Austria), a Gospel harmony related to the Diatessaron,
                        Codex Sangallensis, is the oldest <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> Gospel
                        text in Old High German.</p>
                    <p>It is on the basis of these Western witnesses to the Diatessaron that one can
                        reach a judgement about its original language. The presence of Syriacisms or
                        Semitisms in these ‘Western’ witnesses to the Diatessaron can only be
                        explained by presuming that their archetype was a document composed in a
                        Semitic language, not Greek or Latin.</p>
                    <p>Because of the Diatessaron’s paramount importance for both the text and canon
                        of the <abbr>NT</abbr>, much scholarly effort has gone into reconstructing its text.
                        Equally important, however, is its position as the oldest of the versions, a
                        translation and rearrangement of the Gospels that had world-wide impact,
                        from England to China.</p>
