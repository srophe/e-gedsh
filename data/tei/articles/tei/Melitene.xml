                    <p>City in eastern Anatolia, located near the right bank of the Euphrates and to
                        the north of the main range of the Eastern Taurus. It lies in a fertile
                        plain whose orchards are famed today for their apricots and where the
                        ancient Persian ‘Royal Road’ intersected the north-south route along the
                        Euphrates. Its name appears in forms such as <hi rend="italic">Malidiya</hi>
                        and <hi rend="italic">Melidi</hi> in Hittite and Assyrian records from the
                        middle of the 2nd millennium BC. Melitene became an important garrison town
                        under Roman rule and was made a provincial capital in the 4th <abbr>cent.</abbr> (of
                        ‘Armenia  II’, renamed ‘Armenia III’ in 536). The city lay in an area that
                        often changed hands between the Byzantines and the Arabs after the rise of
                        Islam. It was first attacked by the Turks in 1058, and, after periods of
                        rule by the Armenian curopalate Philaretos Brachamios and the similarly
                        Armenian, though Chalcedonian, Gabriel (Khoril) of Melitene, it passed to
                        the Danishmendids in 1101 and then to the Rum Seljuks in the <choice>

                        </choice>. The
                        Mongols first reached the neighbourhood of Melitene in 1231, and attacked
                        the city on several occasions in 1243–44 and 1251–53. Melitene continued to
                        be ruled by the Seljuks under Mongol suzerainty until it fell to the Mamluks
                        in 1315. The city was taken by the Ottomans in 1516. The modern city of
                        Malatya, to which the majority of the population migrated in the 19th <abbr>cent.</abbr>,
                        is situated approximately 12 km. to the south-southwest of the site of the
                        antique and medieval city, which is known today as Old Malatya (Eski
                        Malatya, officially Battalgazi).</p>
                    <p>Melitene was an important center of Christianity from early on. Meletius of
                        Antioch (d. 381), who presided over the First Council of Constantinople, was
                        a native of the city, while its early bishops included such figures as
                        Otreios, present at that council of 381, Acacius (d. before 449), one of the
                        fathers at Ephesus (431), Mamas (Momo), a renegade to the miaphysite cause
                        who was restored to his see under Justin I, and Domitian (d. 602), a nephew
                        of Emperor Maurice (582–602). The list of bishops for Melitene in the
                        Chronicle of <ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Michael-I-Rabo">

                        Domitian, no doubt reflecting the absence of <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> Christians in the
                        area. The list resumes with names of four bishops whose dates are unknown.
                        The fifth name on that part of the list is that of <abbr>

                        ordained by <abbr>Patr.</abbr> Basilios (923–35), the titulars are styled as

                    <p>Melitene and the surrounding area, lying to the north of areas traditionally
                        inhabited by Syr. Christians, saw an influx of <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> settlers in the
                        wake of their reconquest by the Byzantines in 934 and especially after the
                        adoption of a policy encouraging such migration by Nicephoras II Phocas
                        (963–69), who, being unable to entice Chalcedonians to settle in the area,
                        invited the <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr>
                        <abbr> Patr.</abbr> Yuḥanon da-Srigteh (965–86) to move with his
                        followers to the region of ‘Melitene, Hanzīṭ, and Qlisuro’, promising them
                        immunity from persecution (Chabot, <hi rend="italic">Chronique de Michel le
                            Syrien</hi>, vol. 4, 335f.). Although that promise was not kept for
                        long, the wealth created through this resettlement became a major factor in
                        bringing about the revival of cultural activities among Syr. Christians
                        which has come to be termed the ‘<ref rend="bold" target="https://gedsh.bethmardutho.org/Renaissance-Syriac">Syriac

                        centuries, giving birth to the most important <abbr>Syr. Orth.</abbr> authors from that

                        reporting on his visit to the region, spoke of Melitene as the large city
                        under the jurisdiction of <abbr>Patr.</abbr> Yuḥanon bar ʿAbdun, with 56 churches and

                        city included Melkites, as well as Armenians, and it may have been through
                        contacts with Melkites there that the redaction of the <hi rend="italic">Qonune yawnoye</hi> designated as Melitenian was adopted by the Syr.

                        played in the defence of the city in 1243 suggests that the Syr. Christians
                        then constituted the majority of the Christians and possibly also of the
                        overall population. One peculiarity of the local dialect of Aramaic, the

                        surroundings; Bar ʿEbroyo, writing in 1283, says that there was ‘not one
                        house remaining’ in the seven dioceses in the neighbourhood of Melitene,
                        namely Laqabin, ʿArqo, Qlisuro, Gubos, Ṣemḥo, Qlawdiya, and Gargar (Abbeloos

                        patriarchate in the schism following the death of Philoxenos Nemrud was
                        Constantine of Melitene, who was murdered by the Kurds within a year of his
                        ordination in 1293. The third in the Cilician line of patriarchs was
                        Basilios Gabriel of Melitene (1349–87), while Ignatius Shihāb (1366–81), the
                        third in the Mardin line, is also said to have been metropolitan of Melitene
